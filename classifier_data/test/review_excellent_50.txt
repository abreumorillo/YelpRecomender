a hearty breakfast  i have several dietary restrictions and they are always very accommodating  the food is delicious and the price is unbeatable|i dont go often a couple times a year strategically timed for restaurant week and waygu  wine but when i do go its great cap grill will not knock your socks off with innovative food or design but you should know that before going in ive had excellent service weather in the bar or the dining room by myself or with a group a friends personally i prefer the bar im a casual diner and get unduly nervous anywhere i must speak in hushed tones and remember which fork to use the food is precisely cooked and well presented i enjoy starting with the calamari its mixed with fried peppers so you might be getting squid or hot pepper unless youre careful its a surprise the aioli is a must this is the place for a steak medium rare and also the home of one of the best burgers med rare in town dessert is great  i usually opt for the flourless torte but honestly every thing ive tried has been excellent|pretty much every other day i have a craving for chinese food lol we needed to refuel from the shopping and i found this place on yelp the reviews didnt lie this place was great it is tucked away in a really nice strip mall the decor in the inside reminds me of vegas but it is nicei wasnt a fan of the veggie rolls however the potstickers

chicago its conveniently located right off of the interstate about  minutes north of all the madison exits and when you pull up outside youll immediately notice that the parking lot is packed with cars this is the sign of a good placeas for the food theres really nothing special about it i like the fact that the burgers are smash grilled and that the buns are buttered theyre not healthy by any stretch of the imagination but if i were forced to pick between mcdonalds burger king or culvers im going culversas for this location its clean and well kept and the staff are always friendly the bathrooms are also clean which is important for the weary traveleri cant give this place  stars because fast food chains certainly dont warrant that sort of rating but its quite solid nonetheless

it from washington dc|great museum embracing native american culture and highlighting the past present and future we came here for the frida kahlo photography exhibit and while it was a little smaller than i expected it gave some insight to and was a fascinating candid slice of frida kahlos life the other exhibits show various cultural items such as pottery tribal dress and religious art i especially loved the wall of kachina dolls seeing all the different spirits personified in doll form there is also a section for contemporary art and a large mural in the section dedicated to the various tribes that live in arizona one of the most interesting exhibits for me was the section on native american aid in our wars especially the code talkers in world war iithe heard museum also
