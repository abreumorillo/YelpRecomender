crossings noting that a large majority of the reviews were negative someone who chooses not to believe everything that i read on the internet i signed a lease primarily because i was new to the area with very little knowledge on the parking with all of my belongs in a uhaul and no place else to go i have been a resident of papago crossings since  and i have found all of the negative comments that i read to be true so lets go down the list on the first day as i was moving in i walked into the kitchen glancing into the kitchen sink i saw roaches reporting this to the office i was told that the exterminator came on mondays and i would have to wait until then for the unit to be sprayed i moved in on a wednesday i was also told that the apartment had been empty for a while and the roaches where sewer roaches ive lived in dwellings before this is the first time that i have heard of such after raising a stink the exterminator came the next day still having the problem i returned to the office and was told that a new exterminator had been hired and received notice that my apartment would be fogged on monday december st i dont believe that happened and i still have roaches  the water in kitchen and bathroom sinks run luke warm at best and now luke warm is the best that i get from the bathroom shower too  moving on to the security of the property it was my understanding that papago crossings is a gated community which led me to believe it was a secure property there are gates but no good if they dont work the gates have only worked properly consecutively for maybe days at tops since ive been here one morning leaving for work at  am i was confronted by a man who appeared to be homeless two days later there was another with a grocery cart with trash bags tied to the cart standing on the parking lot i watched as he begun going through the trash bin as i drove away even the gates that require keys for entry are not secure because the locks dont work no code or key requiredas i read the recent postings i do see responses from management with a number to calli call only to get the message we are in the office but cant answer your call blah blah same complaints by different people|do not go to this vet trust me  find another one  unfriendly surely staff who think you are doing them a favor all the staff have lost their smile musclestotal rip off and probably

vehicle herei maintain my own vehicles  i have had many positive experiences purchasing parts retail at other dealerships and parts suppliers over the years but never at this dealership  for ford parts i prefer sanderson ford but have used bell ford in a pinch on several occasions because they are a little closer to home  no more  their inventory and availability is poor  almost always have to order out anything but accessories or parts for a very late model vehicle  their counter techs are not knowledgeable i have often had to show them on schematics some i have printed myself because they couldnt locate the parts i needed or provided the wrong parts  they are interested in the quick highdollar sale and do the absolute minimum to track down parts or help a customer outjust got treated rudely by a counter tech who didnt have my part didnt want to order it and wasnt interested in helping a diyer out strike  bell ford|i would give this company a negative  stars if i could their customer service billing retention and supervisors do not care what so ever about customer service their tone and customer care is pretty much the worst ive experienced beware of this company they will steal your money and deceive you with promotions they wait for your promotion to end and have you forget to call in for another promotion and jack up your service pricenever again i am curious to see how long this company stays in business the way they do business now horrible|never come here ever unless you want food poisoning and mysterious charges made that you didnt ask for i stopped by to

doctor during my appointment and an employee who i asked to adjust my glasses while i was thereduring my eye exam i couldnt get two words in without being immediately interrupted by the doctor who also repeatedly asked me if i have any questions because all this information must be confusing it really isnt and that is terribly condescending ive been nearsighted for  years i get exams every year and i understand whats going on at this point he actually explained to me at length what nearsightedness is and how i can tell if i am at some point i just stopped responding and let him talk until he got tired since he obviously just wanted someone to lecture for a while i just needed an eye exam and a prescription not a series of condescending lessons including why i shouldnt sleep in my contacts i dont  but he didnt ask so he wouldnt knowthe employee adjusting my glasses made sure i knew how low quality they are and repeated it several times even though i replied i know they are not nice i dont make a lot of money i finally left with my glasses unadjusted  he seemed to believe he was incapable of adjusting my basic plastic glasses which ive had adjusted twice without complaint or lecture at much nicer placesi could not believe the way they spoke to me and because of it i did not buy contacts or glasses with them ill take my business elsewhere and im extra sorry that my usual optician was booked up during my time in scottsdale so i was stuck with this place|terrible service i literally have never been treated so horribly our blonde waitress was in no other words a total c honestly bob the manager was very nice but he gave us another waitress who was almost as terrible and before we even left our prev waitress had a gaggle of others talking smack about me and my table then had the nerve to mock us directly and hassle our table some more we were rushed our food and drinks were wrong and were told verbatim i have a table of seven so you need to order now if you want any food she scoffed any time we had to ask for our drinks to be refilled and trust me she never came back to our table so we had to ask we were then attempted to be paid off with a  by bob which was completely embarrassing we never received an apology never coming back|when i worked nearby over a dacade ago i and my coworkers frequented this place for lunch  it was really good then  about six months ago i ordered the mongolian beef  it had chunks of sugar in it  it was literally too sweet to eat much of it  the owner was there and said yes we put sugar in it  its not supposed to have that much though  she didnt seem to understand that it was sickeningly sweet and didnt much seem to care  they havent updated or remodeled since i used to go there and its pretty rundown now|very very disappointing order our holiday dinner got confirmation and all went to pick up and they were closed the lady said she didnt  know how the order went through after showing her the email confirmation all she said she can do is apologize now we have no dinner for christmas cant believe this i only ordered cause im  months pregnant what a mistake|this place assures that  you get diarrhea after every meal after i was done  waiting  in the extremely long line as i told the employee what i wanted they kept on making me repeat myself when i got to the first window they completely forgot my order once more i told them but when i was getting ready to pay i handed them my credit card and they said there machine was broken so i never got my meal i hope they do something about this|my car needed new engine mounts and wheel bearings i brought it in to honest one for a quote and the first thing they do is pull the car around to take a look at it then after they started looking at it they tell me it will be a  fee to look at it if i didnt get it repaired there but free if i did get it repaired there so they basically tried to trap me into getting the service done there nothing honest about that inspections should always be freethen their quote was  when goodyear was only charging  everyone says that small shops are cheaper than chains but not this one this one wanted to charge  more for the same work i wouldnt go here if i were you|i hate when anyone lies to your facei ordered a double whopper with cheese off the broiler because i want my food fresh not sitting in a steamer pani stood and watched him for about  mins pulling the meat out of the pan for all the ordershe didnt take mine off the broiler like i asked when i told the crew leader he ask the guy if it was off the broiler and he said they all come off the broiler i told him i watched him take it out of the pani dont like soggy meat|the service here has got to be the worst ever majority of the staff cannot speak english at all once in the door your going to be on a wait for the longest time at times you will get skipped and they will seat larger parties because of course the more heads the more money as your seated you will have a server rush up to you within a few short minutes trying to rush you for an order and if your not ready they wont came back for it for the longest time once ordered if you did order any soups such as pho than they will have it out within a few minutes because its the easiest to serve so half the table will have their food and the other half wont for a good wait after the food is dropped off you will not get any attention at all from the servers for refills or anything at all expect to constantly ask for whatever you need the pho is a hit or miss theres days that its okay other days its just flat out too oily very busy place  but way over hyped everyone talks about how good this place is but my personal opinion of the food here is obviously alright|i understand this is a impound yard and all but these employees there should probably just kill themselves already i mean you dont have to fit stereotypes but its tough not to call a horse a horse rudest most uneducated idiots ive ever dealt with at this point i really dont care about the rental car thats in their lot im just so thankful that i grew up with an education and will never have to work at a scummy ass place like that i dont see anyone in that company making it pass a th grade education level|bought a round trip airport to hotel transfer going to the hotel the shuttle driver constantly kept mentioning that we needed to tip him he refused to let us get onto the bus without taking my small sized backpack and insisted on putting it into the back the reason that we didnt want him to take it was that there were plenty of fragile objects inside upon delivering us to the airport we saw that he had put many other passengers bags onto ours upon handing us my backpack he kept hold of one side and said that tips are important in vegas emphasizing that he needed a tip when we refused to give him one he mentioned that something bad will happen to us because we refused to tip him all in all terrible experience to the hotel coming back to the airport we ordered a shuttle through their automated service on the telephone  hours in advance the shuttle was ordered for  and we were outside at  as per request of the automated system at  we ordered uber as we needed to get to the airport the shuttle did not arrive on time or at all for all we know|cant believe it is two stars food is awful tasteless and not refresh dirty carpet mandatory tips worst|this place doesnt even deserve one star worst customer service very rude tiffany is an absolute idiot and omar might be the rudest person ive ever dealt with period im in customer service and these people were ridiculous i was made to pay for services that were never authorized nor completed because the tow company towed my car to the wrong place unfortunately i highly recommend the discount tire right next door those guys are professionals and gentleman they were super helpful and efficient |service was a joke drinks were weak food was ok but for the price i can go to fire rock for a cheaper meal with alcohol and a better service and environment was the worst time ever couldnt stand my waitress who was mia all night|so after leaving a negative review the store replies that my negative review is unnecessary  and they dont like that i stated their employees acted like bratty teenagers um yeah it is in fact necessary to leave a detailed review on yelp about your stores poor service thats what yelp is for i do give this place a big shout out for my proving my point when i stated their replys to negative reviews were juvenile and that they try dont take any responsibility for poor service and thanks for telling me your store as over  dresses on yelp since your sales associates couldnt be bothered while i was there also its cute you say i was contradictory that i said the store was crowed yet only had a few dresses your hole of business is filled with prom gowns so try again it can be crowded yet still have a poor selection of wedding gowns instead of trying to be rude a second time go back to grade school and learn how to form a coherent rebuttal ill skip the phone call to talk about it since youve already proved yourself a worthless business clearly the crappy attitudes go all the way up to management the reply to my one star review is beyond comical and borderline pathetic you dont want bad reviews dont give your potential customers a terrible experience rock on celebrations rock on|i would not trust this place with an important delivery they screwed up my wifes birthday surprise i called the day before and specifically said i needed a delivery for tomorrow and gave them the date and delivery window time for her to be home and receive her gift she waited all morning and they never showed up my wifes bday date has been the same since i met her  years ago however they insisted i gave them the wrong day the lady over the phone was rude and when i called to have them resolve she kept insisting i gave her the wrong date she even put me on hold and i heard her complaining to her driver about me as they were trying to get a delivery within the hour by that time it was too late i cancelled of course still in shock at how rude she was one thing i know for sure i am ten times smarter than the flower shop flunky that gave me such horrible service and i never forget my wifes bday date go elsewhere if reliability and customer service is important to you|this store use to fun and exciting to shop in i am out shopping on christmas eve of all days of the year i need a sparkly shirt for new years i am not paying old navy anything for that store to look the way it did when i walked in not that i could find anything anyways i dont care what day of the year it is no store should look like it hasnt been cleaned in months clothes were thrown all over the floors in every department i walked in and i know they have more than  people working there at any giving moment but a store doesnt have to look so flipping trashy the worst part is that not only did they downsize the whole store its been remodeled|from a first time perspective on italian cuisine the menu  could have used more detail andor images to help describe the entrees to first time visitors to carrabas like myself i tried to play it safe by ordering the obvious wood fired pizza and to my luck it was the wednesdays special the bad part is upon ordering our waitress told us the oven had been out of commission for  weeks im still wondering how a wood fired oven could be out of commission i quietly offered our waitress a way out by ordering the tuesday special after taking some time to look over the menu again but our waitress failed to get the hint no discount no apology no courtesy entree just a bad overall experience|sweet stylist but she completely ignored my photos and description of what i wanted and right here at christmas i have no hair at all this was a splurge for me and i was referred to her by someone who said the stylist was good with short hair i got a  cut miserable experience cute shop though and parking is easy|what a bunch of unfriendly snobs i drove nearly half an hour from madison to verona to buy yarn and needles after asking questions about specific yarns no one seemed to know i purchased yarn and chia goo needles one of which had a defective point i had to drive the half hour back to the store the next day to return the needles i had planned to swap them out until i found out that wisconsin craft market sells them for  less and the only thing that the sows ear snob cared about was that i did not return the top part of the packaging that allows the needles to hang on a hook for resale despite the fact that the needles clearly had to be returned to the manufacturer  im glad for the experience because i will never go back|i placed an order through deliverycom and waited  hours there was no contact to suggest that my order would not be received or fulfilled in fact i received  forms of confirmation when the food had not arrived in  hours i called the restaurant and was informed that delivery was not available nor had my food been prepared do not use deliverycom or order online if you hope to get your food i cannot comment on the quality of the food as i had to eat frozen pizza|went in for some last minute gifts great selection but the shady business owner pulled the cover off an album and changed the price right in front of me i hope that  extra you made up for the future business youre loosing|i wish i could give  stars i had a reservation the was marked payed in full when i arrived they wanted an extra  that i did not have they would not do a credit card over the phone or attempt to help me in anyway zak the agent was very rode and didnt see to understand they were leaving  my wife  kids and myself stranded in phoniex my relative had to drive  hours to hand me cash to resolve the issue only to be told they dont  accept cash luck for me a atm for my bank was located on site and i was able to deposit  the cash and finally complete my rental by  pm which was actually midnight to me due to the time difference sunny the supervisor was also very rude and tried to lecture me on being fiscally resposible i pay my bills on time and it cost me over a months salary to make my trip happen i will never use budget again and will be telling everyone to avoid this company the does not know the meaning of customer service|honestly if i could i would give this location  stars ever since they remodeled and got new management the service is terrible my husband and i stopped in on the way home for some food to go my husband ordered his food im standing next to him waiting to give my order when some woman comes walking out from the back office yelling something at the top of her lungs very unprofessional but whatever she comes up to the register and is trying to put cash into the register when she starts yelling at the waitress that people need seated mind you at this point she is directly in front of me on the other side of the counter i look at her and see her name tag says restaurant manager really this lady shes the manager anyway so im telling the waiter taking our order what i would like a moons over my hammy no ham but a veggie patty and the manager feels the need to loudly butt in thats not an option for substitution i try and explain that ive had it that way before she just refused to listen she continued to shout and is just flat out rude i said fine and we walked out i understand its busy and its christmas eve but there is absolutely no need for your rudeness instead of just yelling at people that things need done do them yourself instead of fighting with customers about how they want their food this isnt the first problem weve had with this location since the remodel and management change they have one really really good waitress who has worked their forever and we love but other than that i work in customer service and i know how people should be treated after long day at work all i wanted was some food|i went to  frys stores today looking for  ingredient for christmas dinner they close at  tonight so i had to hurry i arrived at this store at  pm and they refused to let me in saying they were closed they had a security guard standing outside denying entrance i needed  item arrived prior to the closing time and i was entrance|nice faculty and the staff was friendly everything was first class accept the golf course the course is loaded with blind shots if you play it all the time it might be ok if not it sucks nearly every green is higher than the fairway so you cannot see the surface on them either i do not hit it very high so the greens are nearly impossible to hold if you can hit themif you want to enjoy the sunset go to the th hole and save yourself  hours of frustrationi do not recommend this course|well where do i starton december nd  me and my  year old son alex decided to go shooting together  ben avery was closed on that tuesday so we drove all the way down from north phoenix to use the main range at rssc we used to live in mesa and i was a member of the rssc in  and shot multiple high power rifle w mike toliver and tuesday night steel matches i could say i was very familiar with the club and overall with the exception of grumpy range officers from time to time my experience was decentwe packed our guns and happy go lucky we went to the range we arrived approximately around pm and we proceeded to the main window to sign in range officer at the window reminded us to sign waivers and so we did and we paid  for both of us to go inafterwards we proceeded to the main range to get a bench and the guy in the counter called me back into the officehe started questioning me about my son and basically started interrogating me asking for proof that he was my son i was like  what you cant be serious what proof do you need he is my son lives at home with me and his mom i pay his health insurance and his room and board well sir i can see you have different last names i am ramirez he is smith and you have to prove legal guardianship before you shoot for a moment i thought i was in superior court in front of a judge instead of being at the gun club to give a little bit of background me and my son do not have the same last name me and his mom have been married for  years and she was a single mom when we met so she gave him her last name i raised the boy since he was  needless to say i am his legal guardian providing health insurance food shelter and the works i have never had to prove i am his guardian at any gun range or any other establishment for that matter is no ones business regardless seems intrusive and pointlessi got real irritated and told the guys at the office that what kind of establishment asks for proof what is this nazy germany die papieren bitte me and the boy have gone to ben avery caswells and the very same rssc before and never had any issues having to prove his my son the gave me the no ticket no laundry treatment and unless i could bust out some paper saying i am his legal guardian they would not let us use the range after the incident i asked for my money back and went and talked to the club manager bill and explained my disgust he basically told me his range officers had done nothing wrong and that asking for proof was a newer policy they had in the club i explained the same i did to the range officers and he said if i didnt have a paper from the court saying i was his legal guardian i could not shoot there he even told me what would you do if you get stopped by police with the boy in the car i was are you joking me what are police officers going to do call his mom whose at home he then proceeded to give me a bunch of waivers and told me to have them presigned by mom my wife so he could shoot there thenneedless to say we left i have never been more insulted in my life my boy didnt have a chance to shoot which was an early christmas present we went to ben avery the next day and it went smooth as butter no bull waivers no interrogation only dealt with professional and pleasant range officersrssc has lost my business forever|usually never have a bad experience here usually really nice girls but just recently there was incorrect and misleading signage which we asked the manager about tanya or tania dont remember the spelling and she was so rude about it and wouldnt even honor her own signage mistake totally embarrased and time consuming i wish she would have just honored the deal fixed her signage and not been the rudest little gremlin i hope i never run into her again|the front entrance was nice but the looks of the downstairs are very deceiving the elevator door was dirty the corridors smell badly and the rooms are identical to motel in details the bathroom smells of vinegar the room smells bad the first room we got has a view of pipes on a roof the second room was one floor higher and so the roof and pipes were below usthe desk tv stand and built in dont match and are scratched to some degree they are very outdatedthe beds do not appear as hilton quality but very blah the attendants downstairs were not friendly they were talking to each other and when we came it was as though we disturbed them there was no hello and a smile  dont recommend| in the afternoon and theyre out of every single  bagel except two nasty gingerbread bagels then the one slow rude woman working there takes forever to wait on everyone as if she holds all in contempt never going there again|i normally dont write negative reviewshowever this company deserves to be acknowledged for in my opinion being dishonest i was told to bring my machine in and theyd take a look at it and give me an estimate i left my machine and received a call that itll be  for the estimate and  to repair they said i needed a pump that cost  i checked on the internet for the same pump and saw that it cost  the same pump labor is  hr  for  hrs to replace a pump off a pressure washer in my opinion they have lost that customer service honesty you somewhat felt before they moved into this newer place i no longer will do business with them and dont trust them any longer beware of the mark ups the fake smiles and fake concerns they tend to display to you see how much an estimate is and get it in writing before you leave your machine good luck|this is for the film lab they are with next door not in the actual tempe camera building but next door first off found them quite rude i had called earlier in the day and discussed film developing and pricing i told that to the woman working the front desk and she goes you called aaaaaanndddd in a rude tone i literally quietly chuckled because it was crazy how rude her tone was i develop my  film at a pro lab in utah and california normally as i am a full time film and wedding photographer i didnt have time to ship the film out and needed the scans right away so i had to use one locally in terms of scanning quality not great inconsistent from frame to frame which shouldnt happen that staggeringly considering most of the  rolls were shot with the exact same settings the sharpening setting was on the scanner is up completely too high way too sharp and very unflattering the color in the scans is way off sometimes way too yellow sometimes way too cyan i tried to fix the photos in lightroom mostly using exposure temperature and split toning to counteract their tones overall in image quality very poor price   for  rolls of film done in one day timeliness was not a factor but i paid twice the normal price to make that happen other big issue is the way they deliver the files they only offer them on a disc if you have an apple mac from the past four or so years you know that they dont have a disc drive the lady working suggested i buy a disc reader for my computer crazy so i had to go to an office supply store buy a usb and bring it back to them waited for them to develop and scan and then went back to pick up huge waste of time considering that every other pro lab delivers via dropbox wetransfer or ftp i am writing this review because i want them to make it i want this lab to survive because film is a beautiful and wonderful medium and i have made a living off of it for years so i would love to see nicer customer service that was an incredibly rude transaction and weirdly she was a lot nicer when i came to pick up the film must have picked up on my shocked facial expression  better scanning i heard they use frontier great noristu and frontier are what my normal lab offers but why was i not asked for a profile lightdark warmcold sharpness level etc all other pro labs offer a custom profile if they do do this that wasnt explained  a different delivery method she made the comment that it would be so expensive to do something like dropbox i would argue that itll cost you more not to in the long run because even if the scans were perfect i would never drop off and pick up a usbdisc every time big inconvenience i know multiple all film wedding photographers in the city who spend  a year on developing and scanning with out of town labs take that business back why arent they developing here the above issues are  why overall please make these changes and then let us know when you have we want you to make it|awful experience sat at the bar and waited several minutes before plates and glasses were removed from the previous customer and had to ask for the counter to be wiped clean for us took  minutes to get a drink and  minutes to get our foodwhich was served cold when we asked for the manager she came and removed the cold food we told her we didnt want anything else since the rest of our party had already finished eating when the bill arrived and we asked if there was anything else they could do to compensate us for our terrible time she argued with us we will never go back to this place the food is great but its a shame the management is so terrible|this is by far the slowest mcdonalds ever  its a shame too because its right outside of a military base|first problem i had here was my apartment wasnt ready for my family to move into so they had my family stay in a model never stay in a model nothing works second problem is we spend over  a month and we do not have an assigned parking spot we have had to park as far as  football fields away from our building when drug sales are brisk which isnt a big deal unless it is shopping day third problem is the appliances are outdated and breaking down my wife washes the dishes and puts them in the dishwasher which spreads the dish soap over everything but does not rinse them off maintenance has told me that they do not have any replacement dishwashers so he replaced my dishracks fourth problem i pay more here for power than i did in my house which was twice the size i think my upstairs neighbor is stealing my power especially when they do construction work upstairs also see fifth fifth problem is the local drug dealers live above us so they have clients that come at all hours purchasing and staying for weeks at a time apparently bowling you know when the drug den is open when every parking spot at the south end of property is full note to any local law enforcement reading this review i am quite willing to host an undercover officer anyway my kids open the window and they get a face full of drugs the manager says they will tell security but what they do not tell you is security is there  hours a week writing maintenance reports not patrolling when they are awake anyone interested i have photos of security asleep in summary i would rent the problems for month but not month|not even worth the  from local flavor course does not regulate golfers at all so you have fivesomes and singles everywhere so as a two some who shoots  on  you are either jammed up by large groups our constantly being passed by singles makes for a super frustrating round course should split up larger groups and put singles into twosomes add the crappy conditions of the cart path and course and it isnt worth the gas to drive over thanks for starting christmas out with a bang|its a great restaurant but i cant recommend this place because you have to wait in a very long line to get in  but what if youre already hungry  i was waiting in line and some angry old white man poked me on my back startling me  any decent person would have simply said excuse me  this restaurant seems to attract a type of clientele which doesnt have my best interest at heart  the food is pretty average  the prices are a little pricy depending on what you order  if you come alone you have to sit at a very small table  its tiny  you cant even stretch your legs or arms  i do like their omelettes however  it would be nice to only come here when its not busy  if you are an ultra conservative republican and lilly white you will fit right in in this place  if not  good grief  try going to the egg and i instead  they are more accepting of diversity over there|good food not great terrible service rude waitress will not be back not sure how they stayed open  years|do not eat here or from here i ordered food from the the eat app and it never showed up after an hour i called and was left on hold indefinitely i tried to call  minutes later and the phone was off the hook after an hour and a half i called a girl answered i explained my situation she proceeded to tell me that the delivery driver went home and the other driver wouldnt be to work for  minutes and it would take another  minutes to get the food i told her to cancel the order but she told me i had already been charged she did offer me a free dessert or soda do yourself a favor go or order from anywhere else other than this establishment extremely poor customer service and unacceptable damage control do not eat here or from here|
