the burger was decent not the best in pittsburgh like a lot of people say the steak salad is really big and the steak is cooked perfectly so no complaints there the tables are kinda small so you feel a little cramped in there wait thats a common thing here in pittsburgh that im slowly discovering overall not bad no real complaints|beautiful things in this store too expensive in my opinion but my main problem with this place is that the two experiences ive had with the one owner he was extremely rude to me i happened to be in there when the store was closing i had been in there maybe  minutes and he turns to me and tells me that the store is closing and its time to go home now at first i thought he was joking but he was completely serious and quickly walked away from me like ive said in my other posts i love supporting small independent businesses but i dont appreciate being treated disrespectfully a little kindness and friendliness goes a long way which i disappointingly didnt receive here likely will not be shopping here again when there are equally nice and talented florists in the area not to mention cheaper|i stopped in here on a whim while looking for something extra to add to a gift  fun little things that remind you of childhood crammed in to this neighborhood corner shop  the woman working the store seemed to be the owner and several customers knew her by name  she certainly wasnt impressed with my measly two dollar purchase and after a huff of disappointment while disdainfully ringing me up she promptly moved on to someone eyeing a larger item on a higher shelf and i promptly moved on to another shop  i mean i understand you dont care about  dollars  but keep in mind i chose to give you my money and time|good pizza good service  please note  former review is a butt review just like a butt dial|this review is based only on three take out orders as i have not dined in the restaurant or checked out their buffet  i am a pretty simple indian eater naan and chicken tikka masala  their garlic naan is amazing always piping hot with just the right amount of garlic  i even love the subtle burnt end sometimes as for the chicken it is good but the spice level has varied ever time and they have never asked how i would like it  i have never been disappointed with the chicken white chucks of tender white chicken served with rice i hope to dine in soon but not sure about hitting the buffet not sure ill be venturous enough to try some of the items well see though as i love to give things a try|let me just say i have attended this church since i was around  years old i love the sermons so much that i can get through the music they have progressively gotten more and more like a rock concert some people may like that i prefer a little more traditionalhumble music in church dont get me wrong my favorite band is system of a down i really do enjoy hard music i attended the christmas eve service and after watching a lip sync battle my family and i walked out i get that they have to appeal to a changing generation i happen to be in the age range of the generation that they are trying to appeal to this does not appeal to me after  some odd years of attending this church im sorry to say i wont be returning i hope this gets to the right ears because i cant imagine i am the only member who feels this after watching probably one of the best nae nae dances i have ever seen yup they really did that in a chistmas eve service|service was great lobster potstickers yummy but the macadamia nut mahi mahi was a total disappointment overlooked but maybe it tasted that way bc it had been frozen promised with rice it arrived balanced on  cut potatoes sauce was a repeat of the lobster not like i remembered on kauai|got hosed on my award item i ordered a grande pike and had a protein bistro box the barista actually asked which item did i want to have for free duh the more expensive one the protein bistro so he punched in a few things scanned my phone and then entered in the coffee later i noticed my card balance was down to and still showed an available award so he had charged me for both items then several hours later the  balance was  and no remaining rewards what ever he did i should still have about  left on the cardripped off|for all the hype this place had from fellow yelpers i was excited to try out burrito shack unfortunately my visit provided me an experience equal to that of what i would expect out of a shack the guy who took my order was rude rushed me and didnt care to try to explain or recommend anything i was here at a time when nobody else was there so i wasnt holding up a long line or anything to just try something i went with the carne asada burrito this is a burrito that is really hard to mess up but somehow they managed to the menu is full of options making it hard to direct anyone to what is specialty the building itself is pretty cool once inside though was cool to try out but havent returned since and dont plan to|when you walk in djs looks like a real ny style bagel shop theyve got the boars head meats the assortment of salads macaroni cucumber potato chicken pasta etc i was a little concerned when looking at the bagels displayed in the baskets against the back wall though i ordered an everything bagel with turkey cheese and scallionchive cream cheese they do have multiple options for turkey cracked pepper oven roasted hickory smoked and something else i went with the oven roasted they offered me a side and im assuming its because i got a lunch type of bagel therefore i ordered macaroni salad after checking out if ordering in you sit down and they bring your food to you execution of the actual bagel itself was lacking this validated my previous concerns the bagel was softer and less chewy than what you would get in ny on the sandwich itself the turkey was piled on which i appreciated but there was hardly any cream cheese i guess they thought they could skimp on the cream cheese since they used so much turkey also all of the everything toppings had fallen off or there hadnt been many put on in the first place i will say that the macaroni salad was on point|this mall is a bit ghetto but it has been getting betteri have lived near az mills for over  years and the clientele it brings in can be a mix this is an outlet mall so be prepared to find bargains around the holidays its always packed so be prepared to fight for a parking spotthe have a few cool stores like the giant forever  sanrio game works and hm although the store selection is getting better the area can be a bit run down at times there is also a movie theater here with an imax if you like big screens generally everytime i go here it is crowded and full of crying children so if you want a more quiet shopping experience i suggest going to scottsdale fashion square mall instead|so their mexican food is not the greatest and i insist on ordering for reasons i dont understand besides me craving mexican however my bf gets the gyro meat sandwich meal and i always get in on that action and its always great so i definitely recommend the gyro ive never actually had a steak here so maybe thats where i should be at since it is a steakhousethey always bring complimentary chips and salsa the chips are ok the salsa not so much it reminds me of enchilada sauce more than salsa their guac is way more liquidy which is a little disturbing i wish i could rank them higher because their staff has always been friendly but alas my lack luster feels for the foods overpowers the review|the pho was okay but i had better this place was busy so i thought they would have amazing food but it was just okay the noodles were soggy and the broth wasnt hot our pho took awhile to come out and the service here is just not that good it was busy enough that the kitchen staff forgot one of our order and our waiter didnt seem really interested at all other than to bring us food honestly i wouldnt come here again|ok so after much heartache and inconvenience the regional manager contacted me and made a genuine effort to make things right he agreed to warranty out the two bad tires under manufactures defect straight across with an upgraded tire he also sold me  upgraded tires at a discounted price for the  tires that i still had that hadnt come apart yet so so far since i purchased the original  tires i have paid for  upgrades hmmm well at least he warrantied out the bad ones we will see if the upgraded tires last more than  years thank you to the manager for getting involved and resolving it the best he could|all the employees look depressed but who wouldnt be with that many customers to deal with working at minimum wage the lines are ridiculously long almost wanted to just drop my things and leave  as soon as i saw them|this store is ok  i have seen other walgreens  they are all pretty much uniformly the same thing  i dont think they sell tobacco products at this one  which is the main reason i prefer this store over the cvs on the opposite corner of the intersection  use vigilance when driving to this store though because the lake mead  hollywood intersection is one of the worst intersections in this vicinity  second only to the mount hood  lake mead intersection  the past five years there have been too many accidents and fatalities here  remember to always look both ways and to keep checking your siderear view mirrors constantly  for some reason people really cant drive over here  this store us usually pretty well stocked  there is customer service  you just have to wait sometimes or go look for an associate who can help  many of the products they sell come and go all the time with the seasons so you just have to keep checking to see what they have every once in a while|big menuinteresting dining atmosphere birch beer is very goodit was odd that there were a large amount of big groupsfries were frozen but had a good seasoningfrench onion soup was really goodgreat servicethe whole pizza system was kinda oddmussels werent good at all missing a fatpizza was good but the crust was a but too softpork chop was goodshrimp and grits were good|dont drink so i wasnt expecting to like this place was pleasantly surprised beautiful architecture and didnt smell like a frat houseyes it smelled like beer but it was very subtle and pleasant my boyfriend and i shared a bruschetta appetizer which was alrightit had pesto tomatoes cream cheesebut was a little bland my main course the buffalo pierogi saut was fantastic creamy delicious not nutritious of course but awesome my friends enjoyed their drinks and my boyfriend sampled a few beers which were decently sized and everyone could try themunfortunately the service wasnt the best we had a server named andrew who was pretty decent but we had to tell him at least  of  times to get us water to get other orders my friend had a coupon for a free pint glass through an app of hers and we told him at the end of the meal  minutes passed and i went to get him hed completely forgotten besides him this was a wonderful experience and id love to come again|this store has a very small selection from a variety of brands customer service is hit or miss prices are very high youre better off at a large chain youll find a better selection and will likely find better prices|we love the food at thai rama soup with coconut milk great yellow curry so good tempura dishes good and we already know the customer service is not always good when busy thai rama seems under staffed we just deal with it cause we live close and love the food but here is my main complaint and this is something all restaurants need to think about when it comes to cleaning use cleaning chemicals that do not smell more than once we have been to thai rama after pm and that is when a staff person decides to clean the restrooms the strong odor of bleach or whatever is in your products is so strongway too strong and it ruined our dining experience smell is a very important element when it comes to dining|food was great service sucked waitress forgot about us and we had to wave down another one for a togo order which should have been placed a long time ago now we have to wait for  orders to be filled before ours and we have been sitting here done with our meal for  minutes oh and they forgot about our bread which is supposed to be included with our meal all we got was sorry|fillys is one of the few places that offers entertainment  nights a week year round even during the slow summer season during the period from december to april they also offer live bands in the afternoon from  on the weekends weather permitting this is a blessing for a permanent resident like myself they are able to stay in business because of the large number of snowbirds that reside in aj and mesa during the winter if you want quick service or fine dining you should probably go elsewhere same goes for handling large parties the negative reviews regarding service are probably deserved the kitchen is small and when  customers show up on a weekend you will have to wait i have always found the staff to be cordial but then i am a regular|to the administration of scottsdale healthcarehonor healthlast june my wife monika mccroskey suffered a hand injury and needed emergency medical care so we took her to the scottsdale healthcare osborn facility  it was determined that she would need hand surgery and we were told youre lucky one of the best hand surgeons in the valley is available and can perform your surgery today  that was somewhere just after noon that day  we were told his name was dr liu  we were given the initial impression that the operation would take place sometime that afternoon  over the next few hours monika was moved out of the emergency room and into a patient room in the hospital and eventually told that her operation would take place sometime later that evening  she was eventually wheeled into the operating room sometime around pm that night now we have our medical coverage with blue cross blue shield and were aware and i confirmed it when she checked in that scottsdale healthcare osborn was an in network facility   at no time were we informed that dr liu was not an innetwork provider    now i have laid out this time line to show a number of thingsfirst although this was an emergency room situation there was no immediate threat to life or her wellbeingsecond dr liu was not just immediately standing by and was probably not the only option available to usthird there was plenty of time for someone to inform us that dr lui was not an innetwork providerthe surgery went well and a week or so later my wife showed up to the arizona center for hand surgery for her follow up visit with dr liu it was at that time she was informed that liu and the arizona center for hand surgery were not a bcbs innetwork provider  and we have since determined it appears that they are not an innetwork provider for most if not all major healthcare providers  at that time monika was assured that it was not a big deal and that the center would do everything in their power to work with our healthcare providernow you know where this is going so lets cut to the chasebcbs has paid their standard and customary rates for the procedure to us and we have paid them to arizona center for hand surgery  we have support an appeal to bcbs but to no avail and been assured by the center along the way that they will work with us  the arizona center for hand surgery received the rejection of the appeal from bcbs and immediately has issued us a letter threatening to send our account to a collection agency of we do not pay the remaining balance  immediately although they have graciously agreed to knock  off if we immediately pay it in fullnow i have been in contact with someone in your organization regarding this and was informed that among all of the physicians who work in our facilities we cannot know who is an innetwork provider and who is noti get that but what you can do is just a little research on the internet and determine which ones out there seem to be scam artist  because after i did my research it certainly appears that that is exactly what dr liu and his arizona center for hand surgery are  there are over  reviews on the internet describing situations very similar to our situation  it appears that this is their standard operating procedure and you scottsdale healthcarehonor health are supporting their tactics by letting them operate in your hospitals  shame on younow i do not know what we can do to make this  charge go away but i do know that scottsdale healthcarehonor health can try to make more of an effort to not let these types of scams go on in your facilitynow what i can do is this  this letter will be blasted on all of the internet sites i can possibly find dealing with scottsdale healthcare and the arizona center for hand surgery  everyone out there needs to know what they are getting into when they show up to an emergency room and are directed toward a doctor involved with the arizona center for hand surgery|service is always a hitormiss here some days i go in and i am treated like i dont exist and others i meet a wonderful employee who is super helpful there were two women by the names elyse and alyce lol i met and they were wonderful products always a plenty i just wish all employees had the same level of great service|i dont go to applebees in general very often but i do remember the food being decentnot the case at this location warm springs  we ordered mozzarella sticks as an appetizer they were barely cooked  cheese not even slightly melted on the inside  i got a steak ordered medium and got just below well done  it was seasoned nice though but why even ask how i want it cooked if youre not going to get it even close  my friend got the chicken finger mac n cheese and she said it was pretty substandard we both agreed that this is basically dennys quality food but at twice the price|extremely small room with a view of the side of another building up close  what more can i ask for  how about a tv with a missing remote yes strange stains in the bathroom sink yes all for over the price of hotels on the strip itself  oh yes|when we visit vegas we make a point to eat here  i must say our recent dining experience was very disappointing   we started with papaya salad which was a little too sweet  the garlic prawns was very greasy pad thai and yellow curry were meh  also the portions are very small compared to our previous visits  we will be taking a break from coming here|really mediocre happy hour my oysters were a little concerning very dried out and flat will not be back|i played craps for a couple hours at the mirage  i had more fun the previous two nights at playing at binions and at planet hollywood  three nights of gambling and i broke even  the problem at the mirage appears to be burned out employees there was a palpable level of disdain emanating from the craps table workers  one employee bragged hed worked there  years but to me seemed to hate the customers and players  these guys should retrain and find new careers maybe  other tables at other casinos were joyous the personnel helpful and positive my wife and cousins hung at the bar while we played  they said the service was disdainful there  we all tip well and have good jobs so it isnt us later that evening i went to another table at mirage and one employee was great so its not all of themi have to recommend crap lessons at planet hollywood  i lost some money there after but thats just the roll of the dice sometimesi have to recommend beatles love showfantastic|already very not satisfied with the service and my room and i just walked ini requested high floor and a view when i got there the receptionist told me my crappy room was the only one available if youre going to bullshit are least look at my reservation and the line behind mendly i understand its the holidays and you probably dont wanna be here but at least sound like youre willing to deal with me for a few minutes more im not going to name names but watch that attitude rd the hallway smells kind of grossth for the amount of money i paid for this room at least give me a clean room and with toothbrushes and paste i asked for extra towels and its been  mins now i am still waiting yes i paused while writing and not mentioning my fken view is the back of the hotel where the ac tube units are i could have spent a lot less money for a cleaner and with view room i feel being liedconed by this stupid socalled starred hotel th the bed is just okay not that comfy and especially the uncleanness of it makes me feel very uncomfortable the complimentary wifi is laggy but useable  called front desk for assistant but waited  for someone to answer i gave up waiting no instructions on how to use certain things in the room and no menu on tv channelsetc i paid  with a deal including tax and everything upon checking in it charged me  instead not that i care about the extra  but its the principal this is only a star worth hotel to me probably one of the worse if not the worst for the amount i paid|this hotel has taken a serious dive too many little kids in the casinoand i mean little a little four year old was lost around my slot machine crying at  am finally his idiot mother found him and guess what she started yelling at him i could not believe it where is casino security the other turn off are the number of women parading around the casino in their bathing suits drunk around all these little kids i witnessed one of these drunks literally messing with one of the little kids behind her and her parents back one of her huge nasty butt cheeks was hanging out she was barefoot staggering and spilling her drink everywhere twoyes two mgm security guys walked by her one of them actually turned around to check out her butt i am not a prude and i understand that is a long hall to the pools from anyones hotel room but i think that the other guests in the hotel are allowed a certain amount of respect it seems like the mgm is attracting a much lower class of people geez|when i checked in speaking with carmen and promised view of strip with upgraded room that did not happen we received view of back of mgm very disappointed here with my parents and wanted them to enjoy there stay refrigerator was stocked with beverage and snacks overpriced oz pringles smart water    room was dirty candy rappers in nightstand  mildew on shower ceiling not good for me we will not be coming back|the beds were very firm and the pillows too the room was  nice and clean very noisy in the halls at night the staff was excellent no problems therethe casino was a problem when security is there it was fine as well as the other employees on the floor but as soon as they moved to another area the hookers came and bothered you this never happened before  drunks too  i came to mgm for gambling not hookers  we went to see the aria a drunk wanted money from me while i was playing a machine that really scared me  he was in my face big time no security in sight   my friend played the same machine for over  hrs and got dozens of bonus rounds and always got the same prize  cents  it happened to me on a different type slot  we thought it odd the same lousy prize so many time i played quick hits for a long time too and had the same problem  we both thought the games are rigged its no fun any more i was at the wynn and there were no hookers or drunks bothering us at all had a nice relaxed time  if i can afford it i might stay there next trip or try the bellagio we went to see the aria and i was playing a machine  a drunk wanted my money  there was no security any where  we left las vegas is not as much fun as it used to be|party of  i expected a lot more than what i got for  dollars  steaks over cooked meat was well done and dry  vegetables were  tasteless needed some seasoning the deserts were not very good very bland   the lobster and shrimp were great the coffee was starbucks which is not my favorite  service was not good  the waiter seated us left and seated others we had to wait and wait to get water champagne  and even longer for coffee its all las vegas hype   i would never go back again  we had a better meal at he gordon ramsey restaurant at paris  we paid  dollars for a crappy meal  do not waste your money|lot of negative reviews  but ive been here for brunch before and knew it was ok going in  todays meal was decent bigger selection than i remember big roast chicken sausage omelet was so good french toast was still  hot  cinnamon bun was good  cheesy potatoes were tasty  i didnt have sushi  mexican  italian or chinese  but there was quite a nice little selection of each  service was great today very friendly  cleared plates as we finished them  legit the place looking nice  the soda cups all had water spots in them  it was hard to find a decent looking chip at the soda bar   desert selection looked ok  i added caramel pecan sauce to my cinnamon bun  not a bad brunch for the price on the strip husband ate the seafood he said it was really good  cold  fresh mussels clams shrimp crab etc|they dont know how to make poached eggs they came back hard but after being sent back the new batch was fine fries were not cooked in good oil fruit was fine very expensive for what you get servers very nice|we came in for a lateish dinner hey its vegas late is a relative term the service was alright but the food was just okay i had the loco moco and the rice was inedible it tasted as it had burned and only the charred bits were removed the hot dog was supposedly good but seemed like little food for the price|we were super disappointed in this place we were going to have christmas eve dinner at the buffet inside caesars but the wait was  minutes we decided to check out triple georges instead my husband got the meatloaf and mashed potatoes which tasted like a hungry man tv dinner i paid  for the grouper fish dinner which was not impressive either we are super disappointed that we did not like this place|food was good service was horrid for a more than half empty restaurant it took min to get a club sandwich and hot dog the waitress was standing around at the far end of the bar refills on drinks were not offered till the end of the meal try not to go|this place looks like a brokendown shanty shack on the border it hasnt been dusted in years and it took a few minutes between being seated and seeing our waiterthat being said the food was amazing i would give  stars on food for sure the prices are what youd expect on the strip but they have a few inexpensive options specifically breakfast i had the chicken enchiladas and was blown away by the flavorplease for the love of the gods clean your decorations i know you are going for the cobbled together look but it looks like you take no pride in your place dusting would have given you  stars|i have been here twice in the past year the first time was ok this time the service was poor and the food a little less on point  my advice is to drive a couple more blocks to bricktop and get better food and service this time was during lunch with the place about  full not very busy  table of four people we were perfunctorily seated  we waited  minutes for a server to come and fill the water glasses he did say our waiter would arrive shortly we waited another five minutes for him to show up  then he asked if we wanted anything else to drink one member of the party asked to see the beer menu more waiting  brought the beer menu and left more waiting  showed up later and took the drinks order waited some more but not too long drinks arrived  waited some more and he brought the menus  waited some more and he took the appetizer order appetizers came out in a reasonable timeframe took our entree order but when one person wanted something he was told they were out of that and two other entree items could of mentioned that when he gave the menus  food came out in a reasonable timeframe but the waiter did not clear the appetizer plates or the empty beer bottles on the table which had been available for several minutes  just placed the entrees and left  a few minutes later he came and cleared the appetizer plates but left the empty beer bottles   some food  was ok but one member of the party said his meal was really bad and left most of his food on the plate he is a college student and tolerant of college fare so this says something entre plates were cleared fairly promptly but the empty beer bottles remained on the table  water glasses were filled at good intervals check arrived at a reasonable timeframe i seldom write poor reviews but this experience warranted it  due to the food quality poor service and portion size for price i recommend you not go here|food was very good service was attentive atmosphere was very oldschool and outdated pricing was sky high for what we received will not be going back| hour coffee shop winninglove this place lots of areas to get stuff done and some great sandwich names too unfortunately not a huge tea or ice tea selection but i definitely approve of the groove here|well it started off gooduntil the hostess skipped us for a seat  she gave us a pager and told us it would be  to  minutes for a seat close to  minutes went by so i walked up to ask what the deal was she looked clearly confused she told me someone else had come up with the same pager numberhow is that possible she apologized but cmon seating people isnt rocket scienceor is it apparently she wrote the wrong pager number next to my namei spoke to the manager about it and he seemed to somewhat care half heartedly but also implied i maybe had set my pager down somewhere and two dudes picked it up and took our place in linefirst of all how did i still have a pager when i walked up to the hostess stand secondly i dont know who would set a pager down somewhere and forget about it if theyre seriously waiting for a table i had my grandmother with me wanted to take her to a nice christmas eve breakfastthe pager never left my hands me setting my pager down somewhere makes no sense and hes bogus for believing the hostess who fed him that liei guess  girls working the hostess stand isnt enoughmaybe they need  girls up there to make sure the job gets done properly i ordered the french toast my grandmother had the eggs and bacon we enjoyed our food long story short the food was good our waitress was good but the service left something to be desired|if i wanted a pre made breakfast burrito i can go to the store and get one for a lot less so make it fresh i dont mind waiting what you served me today was disgusting|ch has some cool clothes love the whole silver metallic accessories that are on their stuff and some of the designs are pretty unique i would say their clothes are pretty high quality and a symbol of luxuryi see some celebrities wear this brand still too much for my blood haha like  for a shirt much but it is visually appealing|what happened  mimis was our favorite but this location was below average the service was slow and a very loud sneeze in the food prep area creeped us all out all the fruit in the fruit cup still had the skin and the cheese was hard on my crepes because it was not warm anymore not sure what happened this place used to always be great too bad|flavorless tacos i added the little container of salsa it too was flavorless this airport has no decent food options but at least it didnt make us sick so busy but just corporate trash that is tasteless and serves to the lowest common denominator between connections|poor service okay food and overpriced i thought being off the strip that this place would be good but i have paid way less for higher quality korean food in the bay area washington and la i came here for the all you can eat lunch buffet but it was hardly that because the waitresses did not keep the food flowing for a new set of kimchi it took  minutes and  different waitresses only to give us a single small plate of cabbage kimchi a lot of the poor service was simply because we were not koreanfull korean the tables with korean guests speaking korean got all the meat and kimchi they could ever want with prompt service only wonder the best reviews on yelp are from koreans the meat was okay but the typical favorites such as galbi were not included in the buffet option and available as an overpriced menu item go here if youre desperate for korean food but dont worry about how much it costs the service youll receive and the quality of food youll receive|dont go out of your way to eat here if you are looking for a good steakhouse stay far away yelp reviews for this restaurant is misleadingordered prime rib cooked medium came out rare sent it back to get cooked more still came back rare again but we just ate it anyway waiter never came by to ask about it the bland flavor didnt help and why pour the au jus all over the plate i dont get thatnew york was cooked right but dry and low quality blandyou get what you pay for if youre gambling here and need a quick steak fix this might do it if you are serious about your steak dont even bother yelp reviews may be good i dont know why but this place sucks compared to any decent steakhouse even bjs can cook a better steak and cost less|
