i stopped in here on a whim while looking for something extra to add to a gift  fun little things that remind you of childhood crammed in to this neighborhood corner shop  the woman working the store seemed to be the owner and several customers knew her by name  she certainly wasnt impressed with my measly two dollar purchase and after a huff of disappointment while disdainfully ringing me up she promptly moved on to someone eyeing a larger item on a higher shelf and i promptly moved on to another shop  i mean i understand you dont care about  dollars  but keep in mind i chose to give you my money and time|i will never eat here my family and i just tried to order food to go on christmas eve an hour and a half before closing and we were rudely turned away first we called to see if they

regarding papago crossings noting that a large majority of the reviews were negative someone who chooses not to believe everything that i read on the internet i signed a lease primarily because i was new to the area with very little knowledge on the parking with all of my belongs in a uhaul and no place else to go i have been a resident of papago crossings since  and i have found all of the negative comments that i read to be true so lets go down the list on the first day as i was moving in i walked into the kitchen glancing into the kitchen sink i saw roaches reporting this to the office i was told that the exterminator came on mondays and i would have to wait until then for the unit to be sprayed i moved in on a wednesday i was also told that the apartment had been empty for a while and the roaches where sewer roaches ive lived in dwellings before this is the first time that i have heard of such after raising a stink the exterminator came the next day still having the problem i returned to the office and was told that a new exterminator had been hired and received notice that my apartment would be fogged on monday december st i dont believe that happened and i still have roaches  the water in kitchen and bathroom sinks run luke warm at best and now luke warm is the best that i get from the bathroom shower too  moving on to the security of the property it was my understanding that papago crossings is a gated community which led me to believe it was a secure property there are gates but no good if they dont work the gates have only worked properly consecutively for maybe days at tops since ive been here one morning leaving for work at  am i was confronted by a man who appeared to be homeless two days later there was another with a grocery cart with trash bags tied to the cart standing on the parking lot i watched as he begun going through the trash bin as i drove away even the gates that require keys for entry are not secure because the locks dont work no code or key requiredas i read the recent postings i do see responses from management with a number to calli call only to get the message we are in the office but cant answer your call blah blah same complaints by different people|do not go to this vet trust me  find another one  unfriendly surely staff who think you are doing them a favor all the staff have lost their smile

sales a couple of times never purchased a vehicle herei maintain my own vehicles  i have had many positive experiences purchasing parts retail at other dealerships and parts suppliers over the years but never at this dealership  for ford parts i prefer sanderson ford but have used bell ford in a pinch on several occasions because they are a little closer to home  no more  their inventory and availability is poor  almost always have to order out anything but accessories or parts for a very late model vehicle  their counter techs are not knowledgeable i have often had to show them on schematics some i have printed myself because they couldnt locate the parts i needed or provided the wrong parts  they are interested in the quick highdollar sale and do the absolute minimum to track down parts or help a customer outjust got treated rudely by a counter tech who didnt have my part didnt want to order it and wasnt interested in helping a diyer out strike  bell ford|i would give this company a negative  stars if i could their customer service billing retention and supervisors do not care what so ever about customer service their tone and customer care is pretty much the worst ive experienced beware of this company they will steal your money and deceive you with promotions they wait for your promotion to end and have you forget to call in for another promotion and jack up your

the music they have progressively gotten more and more like a rock concert some people may like that i prefer a little more traditionalhumble music in church dont get me wrong my favorite band is system of a down i really do enjoy hard music i attended the christmas eve service and after watching a lip sync battle my family and i walked out i get that they have to appeal to a changing

provided me an experience equal to that of what i would expect out of a shack the guy who took my order was rude rushed me and didnt care to try to explain or recommend anything i was here at a time when nobody else was there so i wasnt holding up a long line or anything to just try something i went with the carne asada burrito this is a burrito that is really hard to mess up but somehow they managed to the menu is full of options making it hard to direct anyone to what is specialty the building itself is pretty cool once inside though was cool to try out but havent returned since and dont plan to|i was treated so rudely here by the doctor during my appointment and an employee who i asked to adjust my glasses while i was thereduring my eye exam i couldnt get two words in without being immediately interrupted by the doctor who also repeatedly asked me if i have any questions because all this information must be confusing it really isnt and that is terribly condescending ive been nearsighted for  years i get exams every year and i understand whats going on at this point he actually explained to me at length what nearsightedness is and how i can tell if i am at some point i just stopped responding and let him talk until he got tired since he obviously just wanted someone to lecture for a while i just needed an eye exam and a prescription not a series of condescending lessons including why i shouldnt sleep in my contacts i dont  but he didnt ask so he wouldnt knowthe employee adjusting my glasses made sure i knew how low quality they are and repeated it several times even though i replied i know they are not nice i dont make a lot of money i finally left with my glasses unadjusted  he seemed to believe he was incapable of adjusting my basic plastic glasses which ive had adjusted twice without complaint or lecture at much nicer placesi could not believe the way they spoke to me and because of it i did not buy contacts or glasses with them ill take my business elsewhere and im extra sorry that my usual optician was booked up during my time in scottsdale so i was stuck with this place|terrible service i literally have never been treated so horribly our blonde waitress was in no other words a total c honestly bob the manager was very nice but he gave us another waitress who was almost as terrible and before we even left our prev waitress had a gaggle of others talking smack about me and my table then had the nerve to mock us directly and hassle our table some more we were rushed our food and drinks were wrong and were told verbatim i have a table of seven so you need to order now if you want any food she scoffed any time we had to ask for our drinks to be refilled and trust me she never came back to our table so we had to ask we were then attempted to be paid off with a  by bob which was completely embarrassing we never received an apology never coming back|when i worked nearby over a dacade ago i and my coworkers frequented this place for lunch  it was really good then  about six months ago i ordered the mongolian beef  it had chunks of sugar in it  it was literally too sweet to eat much of it  the owner was there and said yes we put sugar in it  its not supposed to have that much though  she didnt seem to understand that it was sickeningly sweet and didnt much seem to care  they havent updated or remodeled since i used to go there and its pretty rundown now|very very disappointing order our holiday dinner got confirmation and all went to pick up and they were closed the lady said she didnt  know how the order went through after showing her the email confirmation all she said she can do is apologize now we have no dinner for christmas cant believe this i only ordered cause im  months pregnant what a mistake|this place assures that  you get diarrhea after every meal after i was done  waiting  in the extremely long line as i told the employee what i wanted they kept on making me repeat myself when i got to the first window they completely forgot my order once more i told them but when i was getting ready to pay i handed them my credit card and they said there machine was broken so i never got my meal i hope they do something about this|my car needed new engine mounts and wheel bearings i brought it in to honest one for a quote and the first thing they do is pull the car around to take a look at it then after they started looking at it they tell me it will be a  fee to look at it if i didnt get it repaired there but free if i did get it repaired there so they basically tried to trap me into getting the service done there nothing honest about that inspections should always be freethen their quote was  when goodyear was only charging  everyone says that small shops are cheaper than chains but not this one this one wanted to charge  more for the same work i wouldnt go here if i were you|i hate when anyone lies to your facei ordered a double whopper with cheese off the broiler because i want my food fresh not sitting in a steamer pani stood and watched him for about  mins pulling the meat out of the pan for all the ordershe didnt take mine off the broiler like i asked when i told the crew leader he ask the guy if it was off the broiler and he said they all come off the broiler i told him i watched him take it out of the pani dont like soggy meat|the service here has got to be the worst ever majority of the staff cannot speak english at all once in the door your going to be on a wait for the longest time at times you will get skipped and they will seat larger parties because of course the more heads the more money as your seated you will have a server rush up to you within a few short minutes trying to rush you for an order and if your not ready they wont came back for it for the longest time once ordered if you did order any soups such as pho than they will have it out within a few minutes because its the easiest to serve so half the table will have their food and the other half wont for a good wait after the food is dropped off you will not get any attention at all from the servers for refills or anything at all expect to constantly ask for whatever you need the pho is a hit or miss theres days that its okay other days its just flat out too oily very busy place  but way over hyped everyone talks about how good this place is but my personal opinion of the food here is obviously alright|the pho was okay but i had better this place was busy so i thought they would have amazing food but it was just okay the noodles were soggy and the broth wasnt hot our pho took awhile to come out and the service here is just not that good it was busy enough that the kitchen staff forgot one of our order and our waiter didnt seem really interested at all other than to bring us food honestly i wouldnt come here again|i understand this is a impound yard and all but these employees there should probably just kill themselves already i mean you dont have to fit stereotypes but its tough not to call a horse a horse rudest most uneducated idiots ive ever dealt with at this point i really dont care about the rental car thats in their lot im just so thankful that i grew up with an education and will never have to work at a scummy ass place like that i dont see anyone in that company making it pass a th grade education level|bought a round trip airport to hotel transfer going to the hotel the shuttle driver constantly kept mentioning that we needed to tip him he refused to let us get onto the bus without taking my small sized backpack and insisted on putting it into the back the reason that we didnt want him to take it was that there were plenty of fragile objects inside upon delivering us to the airport we saw that he had put many other passengers bags onto ours upon handing us my backpack he kept hold of one side and said that tips are important in vegas emphasizing that he needed a tip when we refused to give him one he mentioned that something bad will happen to us because we refused to tip him all in all terrible experience to the hotel coming back to the airport we ordered a shuttle through their automated service on the telephone  hours in advance the shuttle was ordered for  and we were outside at  as per request of the automated system at  we ordered uber as we needed to get to the airport the shuttle did not arrive on time or at all for all we know|cant believe it is two stars food is awful tasteless and not refresh dirty carpet mandatory tips worst|this place doesnt even deserve one star worst customer service very rude tiffany is an absolute idiot and omar might be the rudest person ive ever dealt with period im in customer service and these people were ridiculous i was made to pay for services that were never authorized nor completed because the tow company towed my car to the wrong place unfortunately i highly recommend the discount tire right next door those guys are professionals and gentleman they were super helpful and efficient |service was a joke drinks were weak food was ok but for the price i can go to fire rock for a cheaper meal with alcohol and a better service and environment was the worst time ever couldnt stand my waitress who was mia all night|so after leaving a negative review the store replies that my negative review is unnecessary  and they dont like that i stated their employees acted like bratty teenagers um yeah it is in fact necessary to leave a detailed review on yelp about your stores poor service thats what yelp is for i do give this place a big shout out for my proving my point when i stated their replys to negative reviews were juvenile and that they try dont take any responsibility for poor service and thanks for telling me your store as over  dresses on yelp since your sales associates couldnt be bothered while i was there also its cute you say i was contradictory that i said the store was crowed yet only had a few dresses your hole of business is filled with prom gowns so try again it can be crowded yet still have a poor selection of wedding gowns instead of trying to be rude a second time go back to grade school and learn how to form a coherent rebuttal ill skip the phone call to talk about it since youve already proved yourself a worthless business clearly the crappy attitudes go all the way up to management the reply to my one star review is beyond comical and borderline pathetic you dont want bad reviews dont give your potential customers a terrible experience rock on celebrations rock on|all the employees look depressed but who wouldnt be with that many customers to deal with working at minimum wage the lines are ridiculously long almost wanted to just drop my things and leave  as soon as i saw them|i would not trust this place with an important delivery they screwed up my wifes birthday surprise i called the day before and specifically said i needed a delivery for tomorrow and gave them the date and delivery window time for her to be home and receive her gift she waited all morning and they never showed up my wifes bday date has been the same since i met her  years ago however they insisted i gave them the wrong day the lady over the phone was rude and when i called to have them resolve she kept insisting i gave her the wrong date she even put me on hold and i heard her complaining to her driver about me as they were trying to get a delivery within the hour by that time it was too late i cancelled of course still in shock at how rude she was one thing i know for sure i am ten times smarter than the flower shop flunky that gave me such horrible service and i never forget my wifes bday date go elsewhere if reliability and customer service is important to you|this store is ok  i have seen other walgreens  they are all pretty much uniformly the same thing  i dont think they sell tobacco products at this one  which is the main reason i prefer this store over the cvs on the opposite corner of the intersection  use vigilance when driving to this store though because the lake mead  hollywood intersection is one of the worst intersections in this vicinity  second only to the mount hood  lake mead intersection  the past five years there have been too many accidents and fatalities here  remember to always look both ways and to keep checking your siderear view mirrors constantly  for some reason people really cant drive over here  this store us usually pretty well stocked  there is customer service  you just have to wait sometimes or go look for an associate who can help  many of the products they sell come and go all the time with the seasons so you just have to keep checking to see what they have every once in a while|this store use to fun and exciting to shop in i am out shopping on christmas eve of all days of the year i need a sparkly shirt for new years i am not paying old navy anything for that store to look the way it did when i walked in not that i could find anything anyways i dont care what day of the year it is no store should look like it hasnt been cleaned in months clothes were thrown all over the floors in every department i walked in and i know they have more than  people working there at any giving moment but a store doesnt have to look so flipping trashy the worst part is that not only did they downsize the whole store its been remodeled|from a first time perspective on italian cuisine the menu  could have used more detail andor images to help describe the entrees to first time visitors to carrabas like myself i tried to play it safe by ordering the obvious wood fired pizza and to my luck it was the wednesdays special the bad part is upon ordering our waitress told us the oven had been out of commission for  weeks im still wondering how a wood fired oven could be out of commission i quietly offered our waitress a way out by ordering the tuesday special after taking some time to look over the menu again but our waitress failed to get the hint no discount no apology no courtesy entree just a bad overall experience|sweet stylist but she completely ignored my photos and description of what i wanted and right here at christmas i have no hair at all this was a splurge for me and i was referred to her by someone who said the stylist was good with short hair i got a  cut miserable experience cute shop though and parking is easy|what a bunch of unfriendly snobs i drove nearly half an hour from madison to verona to buy yarn and needles after asking questions about specific yarns no one seemed to know i purchased yarn and chia goo needles one of which had a defective point i had to drive the half hour back to the store the next day to return the needles i had planned to swap them out until i found out that wisconsin craft market sells them for  less and the only thing that the sows ear snob cared about was that i did not return the top part of the packaging that allows the needles to hang on a hook for resale despite the fact that the needles clearly had to be returned to the manufacturer  im glad for the experience because i will never go back|i placed an order through deliverycom and waited  hours there was no contact to suggest that my order would not be received or fulfilled in fact i received  forms of confirmation when the food had not arrived in  hours i called the restaurant and was informed that delivery was not available nor had my food been prepared do not use deliverycom or order online if you hope to get your food i cannot comment on the quality of the food as i had to eat frozen pizza|went in for some last minute gifts great selection but the shady business owner pulled the cover off an album and changed the price right in front of me i hope that  extra you made up for the future business youre loosing|i wish i could give  stars i had a reservation the was marked payed in full when i arrived they wanted an extra  that i did not have they would not do a credit card over the phone or attempt to help me in anyway zak the agent was very rode and didnt see to understand they were leaving  my wife  kids and myself stranded in phoniex my relative had to drive  hours to hand me cash to resolve the issue only to be told they dont  accept cash luck for me a atm for my bank was located on site and i was able to deposit  the cash and finally complete my rental by  pm which was actually midnight to me due to the time difference sunny the supervisor was also very rude and tried to lecture me on being fiscally resposible i pay my bills on time and it cost me over a months salary to make my trip happen i will never use budget again and will be telling everyone to avoid this company the does not know the meaning of customer service|food was great service sucked waitress forgot about us and we had to wave down another one for a togo order which should have been placed a long time ago now we have to wait for  orders to be filled before ours and we have been sitting here done with our meal for  minutes oh and they forgot about our bread which is supposed to be included with our meal all we got was sorry|honestly if i could i would give this location  stars ever since they remodeled and got new management the service is terrible my husband and i stopped in on the way home for some food to go my husband ordered his food im standing next to him waiting to give my order when some woman comes walking out from the back office yelling something at the top of her lungs very unprofessional but whatever she comes up to the register and is trying to put cash into the register when she starts yelling at the waitress that people need seated mind you at this point she is directly in front of me on the other side of the counter i look at her and see her name tag says restaurant manager really this lady shes the manager anyway so im telling the waiter taking our order what i would like a moons over my hammy no ham but a veggie patty and the manager feels the need to loudly butt in thats not an option for substitution i try and explain that ive had it that way before she just refused to listen she continued to shout and is just flat out rude i said fine and we walked out i understand its busy and its christmas eve but there is absolutely no need for your rudeness instead of just yelling at people that things need done do them yourself instead of fighting with customers about how they want their food this isnt the first problem weve had with this location since the remodel and management change they have one really really good waitress who has worked their forever and we love but other than that i work in customer service and i know how people should be treated after long day at work all i wanted was some food|i went to  frys stores today looking for  ingredient for christmas dinner they close at  tonight so i had to hurry i arrived at this store at  pm and they refused to let me in saying they were closed they had a security guard standing outside denying entrance i needed  item arrived prior to the closing time and i was entrance|nice faculty and the staff was friendly everything was first class accept the golf course the course is loaded with blind shots if you play it all the time it might be ok if not it sucks nearly every green is higher than the fairway so you cannot see the surface on them either i do not hit it very high so the greens are nearly impossible to hold if you can hit themif you want to enjoy the sunset go to the th hole and save yourself  hours of frustrationi do not recommend this course|well where do i starton december nd  me and my  year old son alex decided to go shooting together  ben avery was closed on that tuesday so we drove all the way down from north phoenix to use the main range at rssc we used to live in mesa and i was a member of the rssc in  and shot multiple high power rifle w mike toliver and tuesday night steel matches i could say i was very familiar with the club and overall with the exception of grumpy range officers from time to time my experience was decentwe packed our guns and happy go lucky we went to the range we arrived approximately around pm and we proceeded to the main window to sign in range officer at the window reminded us to sign waivers and so we did and we paid  for both of us to go inafterwards we proceeded to the main range to get a bench and the guy in the counter called me back into the officehe started questioning me about my son and basically started interrogating me asking for proof that he was my son i was like  what you cant be serious what proof do you need he is my son lives at home with me and his mom i pay his health insurance and his room and board well sir i can see you have different last names i am ramirez he is smith and you have to prove legal guardianship before you shoot for a moment i thought i was in superior court in front of a judge instead of being at the gun club to give a little bit of background me and my son do not have the same last name me and his mom have been married for  years and she was a single mom when we met so she gave him her last name i raised the boy since he was  needless to say i am his legal guardian providing health insurance food shelter and the works i have never had to prove i am his guardian at any gun range or any other establishment for that matter is no ones business regardless seems intrusive and pointlessi got real irritated and told the guys at the office that what kind of establishment asks for proof what is this nazy germany die papieren bitte me and the boy have gone to ben avery caswells and the very same rssc before and never had any issues having to prove his my son the gave me the no ticket no laundry treatment and unless i could bust out some paper saying i am his legal guardian they would not let us use the range after the incident i asked for my money back and went and talked to the club manager bill and explained my disgust he basically told me his range officers had done nothing wrong and that asking for proof was a newer policy they had in the club i explained the same i did to the range officers and he said if i didnt have a paper from the court saying i was his legal guardian i could not shoot there he even told me what would you do if you get stopped by police with the boy in the car i was are you joking me what are police officers going to do call his mom whose at home he then proceeded to give me a bunch of waivers and told me to have them presigned by mom my wife so he could shoot there thenneedless to say we left i have never been more insulted in my life my boy didnt have a chance to shoot which was an early christmas present we went to ben avery the next day and it went smooth as butter no bull waivers no interrogation only dealt with professional and pleasant range officersrssc has lost my business forever|usually never have a bad experience here usually really nice girls but just recently there was incorrect and misleading signage which we asked the manager about tanya or tania dont remember the spelling and she was so rude about it and wouldnt even honor her own signage mistake totally embarrased and time consuming i wish she would have just honored the deal fixed her signage and not been the rudest little gremlin i hope i never run into her again|the front entrance was nice but the looks of the downstairs are very deceiving the elevator door was dirty the corridors smell badly and the rooms are identical to motel in details the bathroom smells of vinegar the room smells bad the first room we got has a view of pipes on a roof the second room was one floor higher and so the roof and pipes were below usthe desk tv stand and built in dont match and are scratched to some degree they are very outdatedthe beds do not appear as hilton quality but very blah the attendants downstairs were not friendly they were talking to each other and when we came it was as though we disturbed them there was no hello and a smile  dont recommend|to the administration of scottsdale healthcarehonor healthlast june my wife monika mccroskey suffered a hand injury and needed emergency medical care so we took her to the scottsdale healthcare osborn facility  it was determined that she would need hand surgery and we were told youre lucky one of the best hand surgeons in the valley is available and can perform your surgery today  that was somewhere just after noon that day  we were told his name was dr liu  we were given the initial impression that the operation would take place sometime that afternoon  over the next few hours monika was moved out of the emergency room and into a patient room in the hospital and eventually told that her operation would take place sometime later that evening  she was eventually wheeled into the operating room sometime around pm that night now we have our medical coverage with blue cross blue shield and were aware and i confirmed it when she checked in that scottsdale healthcare osborn was an in network facility   at no time were we informed that dr liu was not an innetwork provider    now i have laid out this time line to show a number of thingsfirst although this was an emergency room situation there was no immediate threat to life or her wellbeingsecond dr liu was not just immediately standing by and was probably not the only option available to usthird there was plenty of time for someone to inform us that dr lui was not an innetwork providerthe surgery went well and a week or so later my wife showed up to the arizona center for hand surgery for her follow up visit with dr liu it was at that time she was informed that liu and the arizona center for hand surgery were not a bcbs innetwork provider  and we have since determined it appears that they are not an innetwork provider for most if not all major healthcare providers  at that time monika was assured that it was not a big deal and that the center would do everything in their power to work with our healthcare providernow you know where this is going so lets cut to the chasebcbs has paid their standard and customary rates for the procedure to us and we have paid them to arizona center for hand surgery  we have support an appeal to bcbs but to no avail and been assured by the center along the way that they will work with us  the arizona center for hand surgery received the rejection of the appeal from bcbs and immediately has issued us a letter threatening to send our account to a collection agency of we do not pay the remaining balance  immediately although they have graciously agreed to knock  off if we immediately pay it in fullnow i have been in contact with someone in your organization regarding this and was informed that among all of the physicians who work in our facilities we cannot know who is an innetwork provider and who is noti get that but what you can do is just a little research on the internet and determine which ones out there seem to be scam artist  because after i did my research it certainly appears that that is exactly what dr liu and his arizona center for hand surgery are  there are over  reviews on the internet describing situations very similar to our situation  it appears that this is their standard operating procedure and you scottsdale healthcarehonor health are supporting their tactics by letting them operate in your hospitals  shame on younow i do not know what we can do to make this  charge go away but i do know that scottsdale healthcarehonor health can try to make more of an effort to not let these types of scams go on in your facilitynow what i can do is this  this letter will be blasted on all of the internet sites i can possibly find dealing with scottsdale healthcare and the arizona center for hand surgery  everyone out there needs to know what they are getting into when they show up to an emergency room and are directed toward a doctor involved with the arizona center for hand surgery| in the afternoon and theyre out of every single  bagel except two nasty gingerbread bagels then the one slow rude woman working there takes forever to wait on everyone as if she holds all in contempt never going there again|i normally dont write negative reviewshowever this company deserves to be acknowledged for in my opinion being dishonest i was told to bring my machine in and theyd take a look at it and give me an estimate i left my machine and received a call that itll be  for the estimate and  to repair they said i needed a pump that cost  i checked on the internet for the same pump and saw that it cost  the same pump labor is  hr  for  hrs to replace a pump off a pressure washer in my opinion they have lost that customer service honesty you somewhat felt before they moved into this newer place i no longer will do business with them and dont trust them any longer beware of the mark ups the fake smiles and fake concerns they tend to display to you see how much an estimate is and get it in writing before you leave your machine good luck|this is for the film lab they are with next door not in the actual tempe camera building but next door first off found them quite rude i had called earlier in the day and discussed film developing and pricing i told that to the woman working the front desk and she goes you called aaaaaanndddd in a rude tone i literally quietly chuckled because it was crazy how rude her tone was i develop my  film at a pro lab in utah and california normally as i am a full time film and wedding photographer i didnt have time to ship the film out and needed the scans right away so i had to use one locally in terms of scanning quality not great inconsistent from frame to frame which shouldnt happen that staggeringly considering most of the  rolls were shot with the exact same settings the sharpening setting was on the scanner is up completely too high way too sharp and very unflattering the color in the scans is way off sometimes way too yellow sometimes way too cyan i tried to fix the photos in lightroom mostly using exposure temperature and split toning to counteract their tones overall in image quality very poor price   for  rolls of film done in one day timeliness was not a factor but i paid twice the normal price to make that happen other big issue is the way they deliver the files they only offer them on a disc if you have an apple mac from the past four or so years you know that they dont have a disc drive the lady working suggested i buy a disc reader for my computer crazy so i had to go to an office supply store buy a usb and bring it back to them waited for them to develop and scan and then went back to pick up huge waste of time considering that every other pro lab delivers via dropbox wetransfer or ftp i am writing this review because i want them to make it i want this lab to survive because film is a beautiful and wonderful medium and i have made a living off of it for years so i would love to see nicer customer service that was an incredibly rude transaction and weirdly she was a lot nicer when i came to pick up the film must have picked up on my shocked facial expression  better scanning i heard they use frontier great noristu and frontier are what my normal lab offers but why was i not asked for a profile lightdark warmcold sharpness level etc all other pro labs offer a custom profile if they do do this that wasnt explained  a different delivery method she made the comment that it would be so expensive to do something like dropbox i would argue that itll cost you more not to in the long run because even if the scans were perfect i would never drop off and pick up a usbdisc every time big inconvenience i know multiple all film wedding photographers in the city who spend  a year on developing and scanning with out of town labs take that business back why arent they developing here the above issues are  why overall please make these changes and then let us know when you have we want you to make it|awful experience sat at the bar and waited several minutes before plates and glasses were removed from the previous customer and had to ask for the counter to be wiped clean for us took  minutes to get a drink and  minutes to get our foodwhich was served cold when we asked for the manager she came and removed the cold food we told her we didnt want anything else since the rest of our party had already finished eating when the bill arrived and we asked if there was anything else they could do to compensate us for our terrible time she argued with us we will never go back to this place the food is great but its a shame the management is so terrible|this is by far the slowest mcdonalds ever  its a shame too because its right outside of a military base|first problem i had here was my apartment wasnt ready for my family to move into so they had my family stay in a model never stay in a model nothing works second problem is we spend over  a month and we do not have an assigned parking spot we have had to park as far as  football fields away from our building when drug sales are brisk which isnt a big deal unless it is shopping day third problem is the appliances are outdated and breaking down my wife washes the dishes and puts them in the dishwasher which spreads the dish soap over everything but does not rinse them off maintenance has told me that they do not have any replacement dishwashers so he replaced my dishracks fourth problem i pay more here for power than i did in my house which was twice the size i think my upstairs neighbor is stealing my power especially when they do construction work upstairs also see fifth fifth problem is the local drug dealers live above us so they have clients that come at all hours purchasing and staying for weeks at a time apparently bowling you know when the drug den is open when every parking spot at the south end of property is full note to any local law enforcement reading this review i am quite willing to host an undercover officer anyway my kids open the window and they get a face full of drugs the manager says they will tell security but what they do not tell you is security is there  hours a week writing maintenance reports not patrolling when they are awake anyone interested i have photos of security asleep in summary i would rent the problems for month but not month|not even worth the  from local flavor course does not regulate golfers at all so you have fivesomes and singles everywhere so as a two some who shoots  on  you are either jammed up by large groups our constantly being passed by singles makes for a super frustrating round course should split up larger groups and put singles into twosomes add the crappy conditions of the cart path and course and it isnt worth the gas to drive over thanks for starting christmas out with a bang|its a great restaurant but i cant recommend this place because you have to wait in a very long line to get in  but what if youre already hungry  i was waiting in line and some angry old white man poked me on my back startling me  any decent person would have simply said excuse me  this restaurant seems to attract a type of clientele which doesnt have my best interest at heart  the food is pretty average  the prices are a little pricy depending on what you order  if you come alone you have to sit at a very small table  its tiny  you cant even stretch your legs or arms  i do like their omelettes however  it would be nice to only come here when its not busy  if you are an ultra conservative republican and lilly white you will fit right in in this place  if not  good grief  try going to the egg and i instead  they are more accepting of diversity over there|i dont go to applebees in general very often but i do remember the food being decentnot the case at this location warm springs  we ordered mozzarella sticks as an appetizer they were barely cooked  cheese not even slightly melted on the inside  i got a steak ordered medium and got just below well done  it was seasoned nice though but why even ask how i want it cooked if youre not going to get it even close  my friend got the chicken finger mac n cheese and she said it was pretty substandard we both agreed that this is basically dennys quality food but at twice the price|good food not great terrible service rude waitress will not be back not sure how they stayed open  years|extremely small room with a view of the side of another building up close  what more can i ask for  how about a tv with a missing remote yes strange stains in the bathroom sink yes all for over the price of hotels on the strip itself  oh yes|do not eat here or from here i ordered food from the the eat app and it never showed up after an hour i called and was left on hold indefinitely i tried to call  minutes later and the phone was off the hook after an hour and a half i called a girl answered i explained my situation she proceeded to tell me that the delivery driver went home and the other driver wouldnt be to work for  minutes and it would take another  minutes to get the food i told her to cancel the order but she told me i had already been charged she did offer me a free dessert or soda do yourself a favor go or order from anywhere else other than this establishment extremely poor customer service and unacceptable damage control do not eat here or from here|the entire team in this location is a joke a simple trade of my cracked screen phone took  hours they had me wait  mins past my appointment and kept taking in walk ins ahead of me and the staff blamed we had call outs for the delay im sorry but how is your staffing issue a factor in my long delay shouldnt u have scheduled less appointments if that was the case they were unorganized noncommunicative and rude been a fan of all things apple and have never received such inadequate service even their busiest store on th in nyc service their customer with more care and proficiency will never return to this location town square summerlin and forum shops will get my business from here on|wont be coming back we have been coming here for over  years and they have decided to chase the tourist money this used to be a great locals  place but they have decided to upscale  please you are next to a motel  they have raised the price of the steak dinner and have excluded the beer and the rolls really you cant even afford the rolls this is an insult to all the loyal customers that have been spending their hard earned money for years  you have seen your last  from us|wont return again this used to be a great locals bar but is now chasing after tourist money since they have upscaled you are way off the strip and next to a motel  they have raised the prices of the steak dinner and have now excluded the beer and the rolls the rolls really service was horrible  and i think this is a terrible insult to all the loyal customers that have been coming here for many years spending their hard earned money we have been coming here for over  years and you have seen our last  ps i wrote a review earlier today which mysteriously disappeared|very very poor servicewaited for  minutes to be seated and finally got a smelly dirty table with no water no utensils  do not suggest this at allfood comes too lateothers in d area are far better|what is christmas eve and we come to this restaurant kind of as a family tradition well weve been here two hoursover an hour and have yet to see our dinner its busy but not that busy i had to get up and get hot peppers oil and vinegar myself the restaurant should be able to accommodate its patrons this is really kind of ridiculous and i doubt well be back|we called in to order food for christmas eve they said that the food will be ready in a couple hours mind you we called at  and we went to pick is up by  we get to the place to pick up our order to find out that our order wasnt put in to their system note that we have our family counting on us for our christmas eve dinner when we tried to explain that we had up in the order a couple hrs ahead the girl who was helping us daniella just told us we know but this is reality what can you do about it it blew my mind on the level of unprofessionalism of this place ive been coming to buca di beppo for years and i can tell you they just lost a customer|weve been here for three hours id love to tell you about the food but we havent received it yet we didnt have a reservation so we had to wait for  minutes before getting a boot h in the bar our waitress is the only bartender in the entire restaurant so shes too busy for us now weve been waiting for  minutes for our entrees the restaurant is now closed|our family made a reservation and drove an hour to be here they claimed the systems were down and stood waiting for an hour and a half as many tables were empty and people who came after were seated before us tried to pass the time at the bar which computers were working fineand were ignored for another hour after finally being seated after numerous statements saying our party was next received horrible service and were hardly acknowledged if it werent for the time we already invested we would have left and burned the place down throughout all of this we still continued to be polite and tip well this was the worst experienced ive had in so long|since there have been several changes at chicago brewery i felt it necessary to update my previous review  it appears the restaurant may be under new management as there is now an imposing man who helicopters the restaurant like a hawk making diners uncomfortable  the menu has been completely scrapped for items that we can find at any chain restaurant meaning that our favorites are no longer available  its a shame that after  years of eating here wed actually walk out but thats what it came down to last saturday after witnessing the manager berate our waiter in full view over something that wasnt his fault  not worth going into detail but our disappointment had absolutely nothing to do with any of the wait staff  i hope the owners recognize and resolve the issue|very disappointed right now  ordered the whole turkey  spiral ham feast looked fine in the box when i got home ready to prepare the food i turned over the ham only to find  greenish white mold all over the ham they are mins away round trip now i have to drive back to return it wasted almost  hours on my xmas eve|kind techs but they refused to change the channel had the view on and it completely offends me i asked if they could change it but they refused poor customer service|im not sure if they deserve even  a single star this is absolutely waste of time and money rent a car and drive instead started at am and at  pm still waiting to reach at grand canyon so here is how they mistreat and rip off their customers they tell you to be at a pick up location at am and they dont start the bus until    then they take you to so called terminal for the actual tour bus here you witness rude staff and first rip off they try to sell everything including crappy food  they dont leave the terminal still in vegas until am  they stop at pm at a food joint from where gc is  minutes away they encourage people to watch some stupid documentary at imax   they dont leave until pm for gc   then the driver keeps on reminding that it gets dark early so we have to be back in bus in timely manner   they claim that they will allow  hours at grand canyon but you end up getting less than  hrs including both locations  they stop for restroom break while in way to gc at mcdonalds and which is not equipped to handle that many people they stop at a subway for the same while returning and the situation is not any better  it seems that the tour company owns all those businesses and promotes them all the staff at these places was rude and obnoxious   upon return there is another exchange in the bus for drop offs   the only good thing was that the driver was a safe driver although he was very rude there are almost  buses which leave at the same time so you can imagine  plus people get at every stop at the same time result big time chaos at each stop  rates               outrageous service            horribleoutcome         frustrationaction             avoid|got to go from here a while back food wasnt even very edible scarfed down about a handful as we were starving and then gave up glad we gave up because everyones stomach started hurting not long after think cheap mall steam table food thats sat out for too long and youll know exactly what to expect|just saw the ownermanager verbally berate her whole staff in front of the entire restaurant most unprofessional thing ive seen in any restaurant or retail environment i feel bad for the staff they were providing great service on christmas eve  i see theres other negative feedback on here about her corporate should step in because shes a bad representation of their brand|i am relieved that the other clients had a good experience with dr rogers unfortunately i did not i visited this clinic  and gave my gum treatment enough time to improve i followed the gum graft aftercare instructions carefully my bottom teeth are still sensitive to the alloderm gum graft that didnt take i expressed my concerns to dr rogers and he was rather cavalier about it i wanted to know if he could at least redo the procedure he told me no that it would be cosmetic my bottom two teeth roots are still exposedwhen i visited my dentist and explained the problem i was referred to another periodontist two people in the insurance dental support office advised me to speak to dr rogers about refunding my  i told them about the conversation that i had with dr rogers only to be left in stunned silence the last day of my followup visitone dental professional stated that there was not any gum graft buildup to be seen after the procedure after visiting periodontist  i  found to my horror that i wouldnt be eligible for any dental insurance authorization until  in addition i would be responsible for   for a redo on my lower two front teeth this fee is despite the fact that my own gum tissue will be utilizedthis is a very sad situation to be in especially since we worked hard for our insurance benefits only to be treated as a nuisance for a gum graft|bad customer service from this location server forgot the rice and saucesmgr said he would do something for us in light of our sever  whos mind was flying sky high but didnt do jack shit lots of lip service but no actionhad to remind our server what we needed several times come on dude do your freakin job place was not busy at all we saw him just talking with the hostess up front with no care in the world i had enough and said give me the freakin check and we got the hell outtoo bad the service at this location straight up sucksit didnt live up to the service other locations we are accustomed to|i cannot believe in this capitalistic country there exists a whole state utilities monopoly by nevada energy just like they have in communist russia that allows warren buffets nevada energy in its oligarchy to take more and more advantage of the peasants  its sickening that based on all the data the whole system converted with incentives then switch and baited over  solar customers into  a berkshire hathaway portfolio for their profit|when we visit vegas we make a point to eat here  i must say our recent dining experience was very disappointing   we started with papaya salad which was a little too sweet  the garlic prawns was very greasy pad thai and yellow curry were meh  also the portions are very small compared to our previous visits  we will be taking a break from coming here|the worst service ever if i could give negative stars it would be a negative  my friend  i had  reservations at  a party with no reservations was taken care of due to them slipping the young man   when i complained to him about it he said its vegas  your going to be waiting a while ive been in the service industry for  years in vegas i know who to take care of when its called forwhat a joke|really mediocre happy hour my oysters were a little concerning very dried out and flat will not be back|never again my friend and i both work in customer service and we understand that customers can be terrible people they are not always right so naturally we hate complaining about anything and even when we do we do it with a smile and the empathy that not everything is in your control as an employee however there seemed to be a distinct lack of customer service and overall upkeep during our simple one night stay at the resort  we moved rooms twice and there was a problem in all three rooms we had we paid for early check in and our first room wasnt even clean there were towels on the floor a trash can in the tub dirty drinking glasses on the desk and a distinct layer of dust on everything we called the front desk and they changed our roomthe second room initially had no problems then i took a shower and after i was done the faucet wouldnt stop loudly drippingtrickling water we decided to just give it time and went out for the day upon our return and subsequent outlet search to plug in our phones my friend found that someone had written redrum on the wall while honestly kind of funny it was rather unnerving and we didnt want to be charged for graffiti so we called the front desk again and our room was changedour third and final room had an ac unit with a banshee call that could wake the dead at this point we were tired of moving and tired of bothering the front desk so we just turned it off and went to bed while the staff was great at dealing with our room problems every other time we came into contact with someone else it was not a pleasant experience we wanted to know where to stow our bags before our flight left after we had already checked out the mlife check out desk woman looked like she was trying to ignore her customers rather than deal with them as we had stood in line for a while and she didnt even look us in the eye once we were there a good while before we gave up and moved onto the regular check out line where the woman there also barely looked us in the eye before barking out bell desk and gesturing in its direction the lady at the bell desk just scowled at us before gesturing  to the bellman standing behind us who turned out to be one of the nicest people we came into contact with she then went back to some conversation she was having with another bellman to top it all off my friend ended up talking to the manager on duty who tried to smooth everything over with a  lunch voucher to diablos which unbeknownst to us but should have been known to her was closed for the season in the end nothing really seemed to be resolved and we couldnt get out of that building fast enough|i have been here four times before and few years ago  once for our anniversary and had good experience came here once again in  dec  it has changed service is very poor i came for three nights  with my wife and four year old it was a spacious  plus sq ft room with nice bathroom and extras for every bad experience i am taking a star away in my review and its just first day into the stayit took  minutes to get a person on line to order dinner  and they dont have kids menu the reservation included breakfast when called it took almost  mins hold to get a live person  the bed was bad that i almost hurt my back and neck by the morning king bed is almost queen size in most of other luxury resorts electric car charging is not available at valet they asked me to goto another resort to do charging reallyasked for water and delivered  after almost  hour anything else you ask to the room service they say no very fast asked for foam bath and they said nowent and checked in the bathroom i found it was there in the shower they dont even care what they have say no to any special request|i played craps for a couple hours at the mirage  i had more fun the previous two nights at playing at binions and at planet hollywood  three nights of gambling and i broke even  the problem at the mirage appears to be burned out employees there was a palpable level of disdain emanating from the craps table workers  one employee bragged hed worked there  years but to me seemed to hate the customers and players  these guys should retrain and find new careers maybe  other tables at other casinos were joyous the personnel helpful and positive my wife and cousins hung at the bar while we played  they said the service was disdainful there  we all tip well and have good jobs so it isnt us later that evening i went to another table at mirage and one employee was great so its not all of themi have to recommend crap lessons at planet hollywood  i lost some money there after but thats just the roll of the dice sometimesi have to recommend beatles love showfantastic|already very not satisfied with the service and my room and i just walked ini requested high floor and a view when i got there the receptionist told me my crappy room was the only one available if youre going to bullshit are least look at my reservation and the line behind mendly i understand its the holidays and you probably dont wanna be here but at least sound like youre willing to deal with me for a few minutes more im not going to name names but watch that attitude rd the hallway smells kind of grossth for the amount of money i paid for this room at least give me a clean room and with toothbrushes and paste i asked for extra towels and its been  mins now i am still waiting yes i paused while writing and not mentioning my fken view is the back of the hotel where the ac tube units are i could have spent a lot less money for a cleaner and with view room i feel being liedconed by this stupid socalled starred hotel th the bed is just okay not that comfy and especially the uncleanness of it makes me feel very uncomfortable the complimentary wifi is laggy but useable  called front desk for assistant but waited  for someone to answer i gave up waiting no instructions on how to use certain things in the room and no menu on tv channelsetc i paid  with a deal including tax and everything upon checking in it charged me  instead not that i care about the extra  but its the principal this is only a star worth hotel to me probably one of the worse if not the worst for the amount i paid|when i checked in speaking with carmen and promised view of strip with upgraded room that did not happen we received view of back of mgm very disappointed here with my parents and wanted them to enjoy there stay refrigerator was stocked with beverage and snacks overpriced oz pringles smart water    room was dirty candy rappers in nightstand  mildew on shower ceiling not good for me we will not be coming back|i wont be coming back here again it was a mediocre hotel i felt like the casino was dirty it wasnt clean looking i felt like our room was dirty too a little icky i found a used bandaid at the food of my bed sick the hotel is in a perfect location literally across the street from walgreens and walking distance to the fashion show mall i wish this place was cleaner we wont be back|we chose this place based on the good rating on yelp but it turned out to be a very bad choice there was  of us some of whom on their own and some in couple when we told the waiter we were splitting the check he first brought us a series of wrong checks and on asking to correct them he seemed to get frustrated and started to treat us rudely i went to talk to the manager but he didnt behave the way i expected and told me we should have told the waiter at the beginning he apologized at the end but he didnt seem to be  concerned about us as his customers btw the food was just ordinary|worst customer service first time staying here and its been the worst experience dont recommend this hotel| sucks crappy room light fixtures were broken room was  degrees heater was on blast and unadjustable desk service was extremely rude nothing positive to say not one told to go down because no one would be up to check the room within any timeframe|ripped off booked thru priceline but the  resort fee doubled the price of the room and the reservation could not be cancelled all parties know this but falsely advertise totally sucks|party of  i expected a lot more than what i got for  dollars  steaks over cooked meat was well done and dry  vegetables were  tasteless needed some seasoning the deserts were not very good very bland   the lobster and shrimp were great the coffee was starbucks which is not my favorite  service was not good  the waiter seated us left and seated others we had to wait and wait to get water champagne  and even longer for coffee its all las vegas hype   i would never go back again  we had a better meal at he gordon ramsey restaurant at paris  we paid  dollars for a crappy meal  do not waste your money|i can only hear maybe  clappings throughout the whole show even the funny scenes only some very awkward laughter from the audience i guess we are not the only one that thought it is the most boring show ever|we came here on our anniversary when we made reservation and my wife had ask the hostess to make sure they have the pre show menu and she said yes  when we arrived it was only the holiday menu available no apologize nothing  thanks for ruin our anniversary|entirely unimpressed service was adequate not deserving of the  auto gratuity the staff were barely present in the dining room unfortunately we had to search for reservations last minute in the area and we didnt want to wait to eat until pm with  kids portion sizes were minuscule for the prices they charge the shrimp  scallop scampi was coated in garlic the surf  turf was more like an appetizer with a  price tag the desserts were microscopic for  i would be embarrassed to charge people these prices flavors are better at maggianos dare i even say olive garden i couldnt leave in good conscience without letting them know we were dissatisfied the manager was flippant and wholly unapologetic for the disappointing experience no wonder they have  stars they should have less the entertainment was equivalent to a wedding nightmare dont bother with this place you can get better quality  tastier food at any corporate restaurant|if i could give negative star i would dont come during xmas time horrible  hrs wait and no food rude staffs especially the elder gentlemen on the carving counter super rude and practically throw the food at me|food is overpriced but very poor quality  chicken was reused from morning an lamb was old and not properly cooked  i would not recommend this place for the money buffet is  which covers only basic items|i am really angry with their bad service and the weird design for the restroom i got liquid soap on my cuff three times it is not worthy for waiting nearly two hours|what used to be a great place has become ho hum lower quality meat smaller portions which are still large but price is way up there   for  sandwich with fries  drinks the change to cafeteria style is silly  servers standing around with not even quarter of restaurant full|general consensus gm is very loud and demeaning to managers which has a horrendous effect on patrons|the wait time here really sucks i almost waited here for an hour for getting in and having my food on table so be prepared|we were super disappointed in this place we were going to have christmas eve dinner at the buffet inside caesars but the wait was  minutes we decided to check out triple georges instead my husband got the meatloaf and mashed potatoes which tasted like a hungry man tv dinner i paid  for the grouper fish dinner which was not impressive either we are super disappointed that we did not like this place|i signed up for a yelp account specifically to warn anyone and everyone against staying at this hotel we are marriott rewards members and have stayed at dozens of marriotts across the country yet weve never had an experience quite as bad as thisupon checking in we handed over a credit card and we checked in and everything was fine for two days on the third day we were locked out of the room for an hour while they finally sent an employee up to let us in giving us no indication that there was an issue this pressing the entire timeminutes later the phone rang and jonnie female name was on the line saying they never received payment and we were being removed from the room without it i said we would bring them the same card that they apparently never received in less than an hour as i wasnt in the room at the time and she agreed that would workdespite this conversation as i hung up three security guard enforcers showed up to our room and require not just myself but every occupant of the room to leave to go to the lobby to sort out their failure to swipe the credit card with no warning the hotel was reserved with a card too so they should have had no issue finding the payment informationat the lobby i handed them the same card and it went through no problem jonnie continually claimed her staff left voicemails on the hotel room phone as if that was an adequate effort to contact us about their errormy experience with the staff of the hotel was horrendous especially from the manager at the desk named jonniei cannot stress enough how rude she was even after receiving the card and the cleared payment she continued to defend the fact that her staff did not try calling any of the cell phone numbers on file and did  not try to get in contact with us any other waymake sure to steer clear of this hotel and the manager jonnie if you desire anything resembling customer service|food was good service was horrid for a more than half empty restaurant it took min to get a club sandwich and hot dog the waitress was standing around at the far end of the bar refills on drinks were not offered till the end of the meal try not to go|i have been here twice in the past year the first time was ok this time the service was poor and the food a little less on point  my advice is to drive a couple more blocks to bricktop and get better food and service this time was during lunch with the place about  full not very busy  table of four people we were perfunctorily seated  we waited  minutes for a server to come and fill the water glasses he did say our waiter would arrive shortly we waited another five minutes for him to show up  then he asked if we wanted anything else to drink one member of the party asked to see the beer menu more waiting  brought the beer menu and left more waiting  showed up later and took the drinks order waited some more but not too long drinks arrived  waited some more and he brought the menus  waited some more and he took the appetizer order appetizers came out in a reasonable timeframe took our entree order but when one person wanted something he was told they were out of that and two other entree items could of mentioned that when he gave the menus  food came out in a reasonable timeframe but the waiter did not clear the appetizer plates or the empty beer bottles on the table which had been available for several minutes  just placed the entrees and left  a few minutes later he came and cleared the appetizer plates but left the empty beer bottles   some food  was ok but one member of the party said his meal was really bad and left most of his food on the plate he is a college student and tolerant of college fare so this says something entre plates were cleared fairly promptly but the empty beer bottles remained on the table  water glasses were filled at good intervals check arrived at a reasonable timeframe i seldom write poor reviews but this experience warranted it  due to the food quality poor service and portion size for price i recommend you not go here|oaky had dinner here the other night and was really looking forward to it and it was horrible  yea wine and beer were included and bottomless because the wine was likely made yesterday out of some synthetic package  terrible the stations themselves were mediocre at best italian looked the best but didnt try any as it was all carbs and way to heaven to eat and the latin station was ok with chipssalsa and guacamole bad canned beans orange dye color rice the carving station roast beef i have to say was very good but the frozen crab legs and warm shrimp at the fishmonger looked terrible american was empty when i went to it other than some corn bread muffins and the desserts as wonderful as they looked i saw allot of them in tables with one or two small bites and the rest left in fact most staff clearing tables were clearing plates still full of food i guess maybe two years ago the christmas brunch was far better that the regular buffet  shame  will not be recommending or returning here|i wish i could highly reccomend but this restaurant did not give me the chance what a piece of shit ppl they called we had reservations at pm they close at  lo and behold they called me at  and we told them we were running late be there soon they still had the audacity to say once we spent money on a cab to get there that they were closed to my face i had all intentions of going all out because it is my birthday and lastnight in vegas so terribly upset i had garbage salad  years ago on the strip and never had it since so disappointed|this place has really gone down hill everything is freakin buffet food i went with a party of  and no one was impressed ps nachos suck|bobby is a very rude server she has no personality considering she works at the bar food is very dry and takes a while|warning they are closed  christmas evela casa blanca is losing a grip andor they just do not care   we live in the neighborhood and usually walk there because we have a drink  we checked yelp to make sure this establishment was open before heading out it stated they are open until  pm  we got there just at  pm and they are closed  not to open again until saturday  saw a couple leaving checking their phones probably to find another establishment  saw a man a employee heading back into the buidling ask to make sure they were indeed closed and ask him why they didnt make this clear on yelp and he just shrugged his shoulders  good luck to them in the future it seems they will need it|went there for karaoke filled with a bunch of weirdo regulars one tried to fight me the bartenders did nothing to stop his insane behavior this place is filled with drunks and degenerates that will try to fight you avoid at all costs|someone call the health dept on this place filthy the bathrooms are the most disgusting ones i have seen in years the smell of old water sewer mold in the bathroom is gross wonder what the kitchen looks like ill never never  never step foot in their door ever again clean the place up  ps send your sick employee home instead of hacking all over the resturant|the first time i went to comprehensive womens healthcare i was  and it was my first time ever going to see the gynecologist so it was just a regular annual exam plus i had some lab testing done at the time i was self pay and they advised me to get some testing done just to make sure everything was okay when i heard how much it would be i was very hesitant to do it and i figured i could get it done somewhere else for a way better price however the office insisted they would have the best prices and be the best place to go i made it a point to make sure there would not be any other bills that would be coming in the mail afterward and they said there wouldnt be so i agreed to getting it done and payed for it all up front well a few months later i got a bill for around  when i called to confront them about this bill they claimed the doctor ordered more testing without my knowledge and they told me they would talk to lab corp about getting the bill reduced then i got new bill in the mail for  and that is supposedly all they could reduce it to that was over  years ago and i still continue to get the bill for  after i already payed for everything that i had done this was not the only problem i had with comprehensive womens healthcare after this happened i was finally able to get on my own insurance that covered all of my visits and i got on the depo birth control shot which i went in every  months for that and i continued that for a year each office visit i always waited  or more minutes and i always had a different nurse injecting the shot into my butt which was very uncomfortable to me as a newby to the gyno world i had no idea what to expect towards the end of the year they recommended me to schedule my next annual exam which i did and it was not even the same doctor that i went to the first time although i liked this second doctor way better i dont even remember her name and it was weird that it was a different doctor which did a completely different exam then the first one not long after that happened i decided i didnt want to go back there ever again and i stopped going completely recently they called again and recommended i scheduled my next annual exam there so i called to do that and they couldnt get me in for another month and i just decided i am going to go somewhere else i have a lot to say about this horrific place and it makes me cringe to think about going back i would never recommend this office to anyone and i will never go back myself each time that i try to call they are very rude on the phone and i wait for a long period of time and are in a bigger rush to get me off the phone which very similar to being in the office itself if i could give this place  stars i would|horrible not only did they cut my dog but they discolored his coat not only did they do a horrible job but they endangered the well being of my animal i will never take him back there|went to the clinic  guy hacked in his hand proceeded to use the touch screen  no screen cleaner no gloves nothing  i went there to get better not sicker  if you cant think of common sense ways to stop spreading disease you will not have an opportunity to provide me medical care|i am extremely frustrated with this location i am  months pregnant i have two children currently and have a car that needed some work so i can drive my children around safely so i went to fletchers i went in for some front end noise broken struts control arms and some motor mounts the first time i picked up my vehicle after  of work  keep in mind this is after we talked them down on the price because their origin estimate was completely price gauged the noises from the front struts were still there they said they needed to buy another part  on the house to make a different noise stop so i took it back a week later to get that part installed after picking it up now my whole front end shakes the control arm and axle is clicking and the car shakes when i brake all new problems going on  now there are multiple things wrong with the car that werent wrong before so i take it in for a third time they keep it overnight to hear some concerns i have about the noises that happen mostly in the morning and they test drive it and agree that the noises are still bad and sound like faulty parts at this time third time ive dropped off my car they say that they are out of answers and i need to take it to another location that can help better with foreign cars in the meantime its now christmas eve and im  weeks pregnant out  on a car that runs worse than when i took it in i am very upset that they can leave a customers car like this without answers i will be taking my car to the other location and i will give that location the chance to get it right however i feel like its not even safe to drive my car with my children in it if i could go back in time i would have stopped by yelp and read the reviews about this place before bringing my car here they are going to make it right for me and my family or i am getting a full refund to take it somewhere else please take your vehicle elsewhere if you dont want to be out a ton of money with addition issues to your car i will consider taking his review down if they fix the problem  i have videos recording the sounds that are taking place and how they are progressively getting worse each time i bring my car in very upsetting not okay|if i wanted a pre made breakfast burrito i can go to the store and get one for a lot less so make it fresh i dont mind waiting what you served me today was disgusting|im not sure why this always happens to me when i walk inside of this store i always get looked over even when its not crowded im never greeted im never told promotion deals when i get up to the front and the cashier asks me do you know who helped you today i always say no one its really upsetting because i work in retail so i understand that big of a store you arent going to get someone right away however you should get to that person as quickly as possible yesterday i stood there by the pink water bottles and i had a question and no one was even paying attention to me for all they know i could have been a secret shopper finally i was so stressed and i had to get back to my job in the mall so i just left its really very disappointing and i will not go back to this location because this has happened to me at this location alone way to many times in the past|here is an example of bad advertising my husband and i were shopping at the mall yesterday and we saw banners about the samsung pay free gift no where on the banners tells you where the place is to get your gift so we walked a lot and no one seems to be able to tell us where to find the place we were very tired but we stumbled on macys and more questions more walking to finally get to the booth outside of macys well the free gift is only  for s phones we have s why cant they say on the banners that only s phones qualify complete lack of respect for the customers time absolutely negative kudos for the promotors get a study done on the use of banners and how to use effectively without upsetting people who really wanted to try samsung pay bad promoters|omg so slowits christmas eve and there two cars ahead of us its been  minutes and we still dont have our drinks|went in for what i thought was an annual physical wellness besides the nurse taking my blood pressure and heart reading nothing else was done oh the doctor did listen to my heart he said i would need blood work done and then asked if there was any concerns surprisingly i asked if that was it and told him id like for him to look at my skin as this has traditional been done at previous doctors as a preventative procedure the doctor said he would refer me to a dermatologist and sent me on my way after the blood work was completed i returned to get the results i was charged an office visit for him to read the piece of paper he gave me i then received a bill for both visits the kicker is that because the doctor asked if i had any concerns they charged me for an office visit as i mentioned before every other time ive gone to a doctor for a preventive visit they did a thorough visit and examined skin for any unusual moles lesson learned my family wont be going to this office anymore|simply the worst service i have ever had the nail tech argued with me and blamed me for everything i wasnt happy with the results and he blamed me for choosing the nail polish color then blamed me because i walked in and they were supposedly already closed blamed me as i tried to give him a piece of information to better their service by asking to the customer if they like how the color looks and in my case on a damaged nail the color i chose looked bumpy and uneven on my nail i wasnt blaming the technician i was giving a piece of advice to ask the customer if they like it as soon as they apply it because they are going so fast and switching hands to the dryer which gives no time to check he wouldnt listen to me and start the blaming accusations i left very angry and they yelled at me at he poor dont come back unbelievable how do they stay in business i dont get it|what happened  mimis was our favorite but this location was below average the service was slow and a very loud sneeze in the food prep area creeped us all out all the fruit in the fruit cup still had the skin and the cheese was hard on my crepes because it was not warm anymore not sure what happened this place used to always be great too bad|disappointing i waited  minutes for a notary as he sat and laughed and chatted with two ladies i finally asked the other banker how much longer it would be and she told me he was helping a customer and had no idea i guess im not a customer and dont matter i dont know what bank business needs half an hour of laughing and chatting but apparently all other customers can be ignored|piece of shitwe waited  hours and turned out something was wrong with their machine and they couldnt accommodate us or some shit  what a shitty place|ive been staying at the cosmopolitan every vegas trip for the past couple of years but i came with a different group of friends this time and they chose planet hollywood since it was cheap  i was skeptical to begin with since it didnt seem very reliable i already knew something was going to get me upsetwell i was right i am sitting in the lobby waiting for checkin  im not surprised to find such long lines of people but getting to the lobby itself is just a huge hassle  maybe it was because ive never stayed here before and didnt know where to go but to get to the lobby it took  elevator trips that doesnt even directly lead you to the lobby  since they chose not to valet which was a horrible idea as well we walked through the miracle mile shopping area carrying our heavy bagsyou definitely get what you pay for and you can tell just by looking at the crowd and the lines during registration  loud children crying jumping around with no parents to supervise them  kids throwing water bottles and running in circlesi havent seen the rooms yet but even the nicest suite wouldnt earn this place more than  stars from melesson learned once youve found a hotel youre happy with cosmo do not cheap out and start being curious about trying other places you definitely get what you pay for  dont be cheap id choose comfort over a cheap deal any day|i booked two queens they gave me a one king reason due to availability well if you sell one king and two queens with different pricei dont think it can be the reasonthe front desk gave me a what do you want theres nothing i can do mean face and said they upgrade my roomhow about you booked two flight tickets in economy class and i upgrade you to one first class i upgrade you its just you have to share one seat thanks to planet hollywood i have to stay in a room with no door bathroom which facing the bed with my brotherevery phone call to the front desk needs to wait for thirty minutes to be picked up wait another hour to get an extra bed which is tiny and short  anyone over  will enjoy hanging their feet outside of the bed wait another thirty minutes to get a blanket and theres no apology they have the worst customer service be aware of their manger roberto navarro he is very rude and also hung up your phone if you complain his attitude is its a cheap hotel so you deserve bad customer service |flavorless tacos i added the little container of salsa it too was flavorless this airport has no decent food options but at least it didnt make us sick so busy but just corporate trash that is tasteless and serves to the lowest common denominator between connections|terrible atmosphere rude staff loud obnoxious regulars as the owners just look at you as if you have  heads this is not my first time to this mediocre restaurant but after last nights service it will be my last|poor service okay food and overpriced i thought being off the strip that this place would be good but i have paid way less for higher quality korean food in the bay area washington and la i came here for the all you can eat lunch buffet but it was hardly that because the waitresses did not keep the food flowing for a new set of kimchi it took  minutes and  different waitresses only to give us a single small plate of cabbage kimchi a lot of the poor service was simply because we were not koreanfull korean the tables with korean guests speaking korean got all the meat and kimchi they could ever want with prompt service only wonder the best reviews on yelp are from koreans the meat was okay but the typical favorites such as galbi were not included in the buffet option and available as an overpriced menu item go here if youre desperate for korean food but dont worry about how much it costs the service youll receive and the quality of food youll receive|dont go out of your way to eat here if you are looking for a good steakhouse stay far away yelp reviews for this restaurant is misleadingordered prime rib cooked medium came out rare sent it back to get cooked more still came back rare again but we just ate it anyway waiter never came by to ask about it the bland flavor didnt help and why pour the au jus all over the plate i dont get thatnew york was cooked right but dry and low quality blandyou get what you pay for if youre gambling here and need a quick steak fix this might do it if you are serious about your steak dont even bother yelp reviews may be good i dont know why but this place sucks compared to any decent steakhouse even bjs can cook a better steak and cost less|gross i ordered grapefruit bowl and side of yogurt my strawberries were rotten and disgusting looking my uncles steak potato plate had a dark curly long hair in it probably a womans hair and our server was male so the kitchen must be dirtay server seemed annoyed not good hospitality customer is always right we didnt complain there bc family isnt like that|so good news they are open in christmas eve bad news is guess is that they are open planned on going to espos but they were closed ended up here its not terrible but lets be honest its absolutely nothing to reccomend ordered margaritastasted like they were a mix for good lords sake its a mexican place do those right and they are littlealso ordered the three amigos salsa guacamole and queso the only thing id eat again is the queso delicious we doctored the quac with the salsa and made it edible its the stuff they buy predone refried beans tasted canned ordered the burrito enchilada style with chicken mixed the red and green sauce on top and cheese sauce on side all sauces mixed is a good flavor chicken was chewy rice was bland had to ask for waters idk i wouldnt go again my boyfriend said he would but he had a little green today  not for me service was there|we loved this place for so many years but it has really gone downhill overlooked or burned potstickers and overspiced food that has to be thrown out what happened its so disappointing|worst experience so far i checked in at the hotel  hours ago and went from one room to another due to the hotel inefficiency yet still waiting for my luggage this will be my last time stay at palazzo or venetian and wont recommend them either|some of the worst customer experience i have ever come across i came into macys looking to buy a watch and instead had to hunt down an employee that would finally allow me to spend money in their store when i asked multiple employees if they could assist me in trying on some watches they would point to another employee instead of helping me at that moment i waited way too long to be helped and could not believe the lack of customer service in that store especially the day before christmas i will never shop there ever again|this use to be my favorite restaurant but on two different occasions i have called and asked if they accept reservations they said no i come into the restaurant and there are several reserved tables first time i came in with a party of four they had several reserved tables i come into a  hour wait and when i look at sign in sheet it says called in reservation which was a smack in the face to walk in and see a  hour wait we left and went to another sushi spot today i came in with my husband and toddler the first server came to ask how many in our party we replied two and a baby she asked someone and told them how many in our party she thought i couldnt see her past the black curtain but she rolled her eyes and told her to tell us  minute wait there are several tables open and im sitting outside waiting so my husband asked the male server why are we waiting of there is an empty table i come here all the time and always refer people my brother in law comes  times a week but with that kind of treatment for regulars i will stop eating here need better customer service|do yourself a favor and do not eat here food was not up to par and even a couple days old everything tasted like it was out of the can and the margarita was all sweet and sour do your self a favor and dont go to baja miguels we both got sick |yeah well we were visiting and went through and unlocked door accidentally  next time lock the door we had no idea  they treated us as if we were trying to rob the place  the guy slammed the door and proceeded to yell  i yelled back we didnt know merry christmas and god bless you  we finally found the front and were asked if we were trying to come in through the ask  we said yes as we are visiting and didnt see the front door  then was told they were closing in  minutes and the kitchen was closed  when we left the same rude guy yelled over the balcony merry christmas and god bless mocking us|the owner was rude and provided terrible service when i mentioned that water was poured into my daughters sprite he shrugged his shoulders and never did anything about it we had to pull another staff member over to fix it  he told my sisterinlaw to breath twice when she complained that my brother got a dish he did not order  he then ground black pepper on her dish after she asked him to stophorrible|the service was terrible and there is this one waiter who was terrible rude the food was not that great they need better service and better attitude   and they need to pay attention because this on waiter poured water into sprite because she wasnt paying attention|finally it happened was it worth the hype  nopei didnt enjoy the food at all nothing about it was delicious or fresh thanks for the experience though|our server was very bubbly thats about the only positive thing about our experience one omelette came out greasy the buffalo chicken sandwich was just ok but the real kicker was my meal which came out wrong twice im a vegetarian and ordered the open face egg sandwich it came out with bacon the first time the second time it came out it was not at all what the menu stated completely different veggies and cheese after we double checked the menu we let the server know we had to ask that she take it off the bill we saw the manager adjust the bill but he didnt even bother to come and apologize you mess up a meal twice and feed a vegetarian bacon the least you could do is send the manager over to personally apologize i wont be coming back|i rescued a dog and took her to this banfield clinic to receive her shots and to get a wellness check for her  the vet and techs are very nice and do care about animals but i do believe they are controlled by their corporate system and are made to push their care plans and unnecessary procedures to gain money for the corporation the reason i am giving only  stars here is because of the greed of this corporation  my dog had a rash on her stomach and i brought her here to banfield to be treated  they put her on antibiotics and an allergy medicine that they described as being like benadryl for dogs her rash did get better so i trusted banfield for her continued care they suggested we give her the benadryl for dogs indefinitely so the rash would not return  i agreed to this and paid  for  pills which last days as they are administered twice daily  i continued to have the pills refilled for over a yeari recently took my dog to first pet on union hills and th ave as her rash had returned and i wanted a second opinion  the vet technician advised me that i should continue the pills and they could fill them but that they are otc meds called chlor tab that i can get at walmart for less than  for  pills  banfield should have told me this information but they were just fine with charging me  every other month for pills i could have purchased for   very disappointed with the greed of this company|i ordered take out and was missing an order of yuca frita worth  upon noticing when i arrived home i called to the restaurant and told them part of my order was missing and instead of issuing a credit or apologizing for their mistake they denied it and told me that they were closing and theres nothing they can do i will be putting in a complaint to my credit card company asking for a partial refund|someone mentioned customer serviceits nonexistent in this placetwo people see you standing there waiting to order they act as if they dont see youand if you are lucky enough to get your order taken they give you looks like you are there to take their money away and not the oppositei walked out of that place and will never step foot again in it even if its the last place in town for cevapibut luckily there is others that do their job way better than this lot|very slow long wait even with appt friendly staff tho|it says that they have delivery i guess its a lie|we had high hopes for blt  overall avoid  many better places out there  unfortunately it was very underwhelming and one of us got sick with vomit  service was sporadic at best  prices were a little high even with the understanding that vegas charges a premium   for burger and fries for something that tasted like a national chain restaurant burger  drink prices were also a little exorbitant  im a beer guy and this definitely wasnt a place for me  they did have delirium tremens on tap but for  for oz i think ive paid less at ritz carlton bars|i went because there were great reviews on the beef pho i honestly dont know where these people had pho before but they must all be subpar  i must say that i was very disappointed ive had pho at various restaurants across the us and this was the worst the broth was not flavorful and needed more salt pho is known for broth and the complex depth of flavor the beef was tough and in big random ununiform pieces very unappetizing the staff and service were great though|
