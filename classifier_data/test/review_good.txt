the burger was decent not the best in pittsburgh like a lot of people say the steak salad is really big and the steak is cooked perfectly so no complaints there the tables are kinda small so you feel a little cramped in there wait thats a common thing here in pittsburgh that im slowly discovering overall not bad no real complaints|beautiful things in this store too expensive in my opinion but my main problem with this place is that the two experiences ive had with the one owner he was extremely rude to me i happened to be in there when the store was closing i had been in there maybe  minutes and he turns to me and tells me that the store is closing and its time to go home now at first i thought he was joking but he was completely serious and quickly walked away from me like ive said in my other posts i love supporting small independent businesses but i dont appreciate being treated disrespectfully a little kindness and friendliness goes a long way which i disappointingly didnt receive here likely will not be shopping here again when there are equally nice and talented florists in the area not to mention cheaper|good pizza good service  please note  former review is a butt review just like a butt dial|this review is based only on three take out orders as i have not dined in the restaurant or checked out their buffet  i am a pretty simple indian eater naan and chicken tikka masala  their garlic naan is amazing always piping hot with just the right amount of garlic  i even love the subtle burnt end sometimes as for the chicken it is good but the spice level has varied ever time and they have never asked how i would like it  i have never been disappointed with the chicken white chucks of tender white chicken served with rice i hope to dine in soon but not sure about hitting the buffet not sure ill be venturous enough to try some of the items well see though as i love to give things a try|pretty much every other day i have a craving for chinese food lol we needed to refuel from the shopping and i found this place on yelp the reviews didnt lie this place was great it is tucked away in a really nice strip mall the decor in the inside reminds me of vegas but it is nicei wasnt a fan of the veggie rolls however the potstickers appetizer was really good pan fried i got the general tso chicken without the spice since you can alway get spicy dishes without spice it was really good i wish i had more rice on the side but that is okay the flavor was amazing  i was able to try the chicken lo mein and the flavor was amazing to me you never know how the lo mein noddles are going to be made but the way they made their noodles were great i cant wait to come back here next time im in charlotte highly recommend yum|this is my goto culvers whenever im driving between minneapolis and chicago its conveniently located right off of the interstate about  minutes north of all the madison exits and when you pull up outside youll immediately notice that the parking lot is packed with cars this is the sign of a good placeas for the food theres really nothing special about it i like the fact that the burgers are smash grilled and that the buns are buttered theyre not healthy by any stretch of the imagination but if i were forced to pick between mcdonalds burger king or culvers im going culversas for this location its clean and well kept and the staff are always friendly the bathrooms are also clean which is important for the weary traveleri cant give this place  stars because fast food chains certainly dont warrant that sort of rating but its quite solid nonetheless  stars|great museum embracing native american culture and highlighting the past present and future we came here for the frida kahlo photography exhibit and while it was a little smaller than i expected it gave some insight to and was a fascinating candid slice of frida kahlos life the other exhibits show various cultural items such as pottery tribal dress and religious art i especially loved the wall of kachina dolls seeing all the different spirits personified in doll form there is also a section for contemporary art and a large mural in the section dedicated to the various tribes that live in arizona one of the most interesting exhibits for me was the section on native american aid in our wars especially the code talkers in world war iithe heard museum also hosts various events such as a lovely chocolate festival i had attended a year or two ago and native american dinners admission for adults is  and free for native americans|missed this place for about seven years while i worked elsewhere it is every bit as awesome as it was when i worked downtown many years ago superb variety of menu items i go for the dietfriendly chicken tacos and the amazing salsa bar the staff recognizes regulars like me and theyre super friendly|houstons hillstonetheyre all the same  what you get is delicious food great service a slick atmosphere and an expensive tab  hillstone is the perfect business dinner or date night spot  the bar is nice and the patio is great  for the food you cant go wrong with anything but my go to is the french dip or the ribs|why would you go to a suburb for an expensive getawayi have stayed at the phoenician and royal palms and both leave me baffledthe royal palms is old  it is right on the highway and the car noise is prevalent  we got to the room and the best word i can use to describe it  no maybe two words  battered and tired  chipped paint  sticky topped furniture  nicked paint everywhere  and really really dark  they moved us and the new room is very nice but also a massive accommodation to us and not close to our original price categrory of  per nightyes as others have said the grounds are lovely  but it is still right next to a major thoroughfare so very loud  the pool is small  so is the fitness center  the shower has low pressure and the hvac system is incredibly loudour bed is sloped in the middle  the food is delicious  the staff is extremely responsive and helpfuli would not stay here again in its current state but if it were upgraded the food and grounds would make it returnable|service was great lobster potstickers yummy but the macadamia nut mahi mahi was a total disappointment overlooked but maybe it tasted that way bc it had been frozen promised with rice it arrived balanced on  cut potatoes sauce was a repeat of the lobster not like i remembered on kauai|christmas eve meal with my oldest daughter got tbone steak and eggs with red potatos  cooked perfectly and well seasoned and they know how to cook a good over easy egg without wrecking it latisha was my server she was decent i was happy to find a place open during these hours|very good food the menu is pretty limited so check before you go good seafood some poultry and minimal beef which we likedwinner of the night was desert the choccamisso  it was truly outstanding service was good and the hostess was welcoming in spite of the holiday crowd|when you walk in djs looks like a real ny style bagel shop theyve got the boars head meats the assortment of salads macaroni cucumber potato chicken pasta etc i was a little concerned when looking at the bagels displayed in the baskets against the back wall though i ordered an everything bagel with turkey cheese and scallionchive cream cheese they do have multiple options for turkey cracked pepper oven roasted hickory smoked and something else i went with the oven roasted they offered me a side and im assuming its because i got a lunch type of bagel therefore i ordered macaroni salad after checking out if ordering in you sit down and they bring your food to you execution of the actual bagel itself was lacking this validated my previous concerns the bagel was softer and less chewy than what you would get in ny on the sandwich itself the turkey was piled on which i appreciated but there was hardly any cream cheese i guess they thought they could skimp on the cream cheese since they used so much turkey also all of the everything toppings had fallen off or there hadnt been many put on in the first place i will say that the macaroni salad was on point|this mall is a bit ghetto but it has been getting betteri have lived near az mills for over  years and the clientele it brings in can be a mix this is an outlet mall so be prepared to find bargains around the holidays its always packed so be prepared to fight for a parking spotthe have a few cool stores like the giant forever  sanrio game works and hm although the store selection is getting better the area can be a bit run down at times there is also a movie theater here with an imax if you like big screens generally everytime i go here it is crowded and full of crying children so if you want a more quiet shopping experience i suggest going to scottsdale fashion square mall instead|so their mexican food is not the greatest and i insist on ordering for reasons i dont understand besides me craving mexican however my bf gets the gyro meat sandwich meal and i always get in on that action and its always great so i definitely recommend the gyro ive never actually had a steak here so maybe thats where i should be at since it is a steakhousethey always bring complimentary chips and salsa the chips are ok the salsa not so much it reminds me of enchilada sauce more than salsa their guac is way more liquidy which is a little disturbing i wish i could rank them higher because their staff has always been friendly but alas my lack luster feels for the foods overpowers the review|wings are great for every occasion  i love this place but if a girl name ashley takes your order over the phone it makes your experience rocky  she definitely needs to work on her language skills with customers  all you get is an irritating tone the whole time she is taking your order  if you dine in its great if you order take out i hope you get a better customer service experience then what i received|i dont know why any one complains about customer service or their services the wait was long due to how many people come here but when i was taken to the back the ladies were super nice and i will be returning when i am back in town|though ive been to various starbucks in the valley and they are all good the lake meadbuffalo location is my favorite ive never had the chance to in this particular establishment due to it always being fullwhich imo is a great indication that its good so i always go through the drive thru and they have been nothing short of excellent so with this location being great overall i wanted to shine some attention to the drive thru crew i want to commend the drive thru employees for being consistently stellar with their service|ok so after much heartache and inconvenience the regional manager contacted me and made a genuine effort to make things right he agreed to warranty out the two bad tires under manufactures defect straight across with an upgraded tire he also sold me  upgraded tires at a discounted price for the  tires that i still had that hadnt come apart yet so so far since i purchased the original  tires i have paid for  upgrades hmmm well

which was alrightit had pesto tomatoes cream cheesebut was a little bland my main course the buffalo pierogi saut was fantastic creamy delicious not nutritious of course but awesome my friends enjoyed their drinks and my boyfriend sampled a few beers which were decently sized and everyone could try themunfortunately the service wasnt the best we had a server named andrew who was pretty decent but we had to tell him at least  of  times to get us water to get other orders my friend had a coupon for a free pint glass through an app of hers and we told him at the end of the meal  minutes passed and i went to get him hed completely forgotten besides him this was a wonderful experience and id love to come again|small but almost everything you need i was recently in new york and did not need to bring back anything except doughnuts why because mak has it all here with many prices lower than ny standards the reason i gave  stars is because they have so much but some items take so long to restock not their fault but they have the game in town so no alternative other than to wait for what i need|the hotel is an historic beautifully maintained building  staff is friendly rooms clean and the bed was just awesome  slept better than normal  the room was very quiet the sheets and towels are great  i prepurchased a breakfast buffet ticket but there was no buffet  they offered anything on the menu but i dont think i got my monies worth on the breakfast  everything about the place is expensive  parking food room rate wifi  some other reviews mentioned very small rooms  i was in an upgraded single and it was very large but i paid extra for it  i would stay again|took awhile for the food but it was very good service was great well be going back|i waited at the northlake mall for

love that every time i call or visit the store i get great servicehaving an old version iphone i stopped in yesterday to see if i was ready for an upgrade unfortunately i was several months away

data over there were some issues with my contacts and photos but he was able to solve and by the time we were done everything was migrated smoothlyin addition i decided to exchange my old ipad for a new ipad mini again with a great offeri would definitely recommend stopping by even if you may not be eligible for an upgrade as they seem to have offers all the timethe manager and josh are great assets to the verizon team|quick service  of the time and  of their cabs are new and clean great job yellow cab for setting the bar high for other cab companies |you saved me on christmas eve   shop

always good when busy thai rama seems under staffed we just deal with it cause we live close and love the food but here is my main complaint and this is something all restaurants need to think about when it comes to cleaning use cleaning chemicals that do not smell more than once we have been to thai rama after pm and that is when a staff person decides to clean the restrooms the strong odor of bleach or whatever is in your products is so strongway too strong and it ruined our dining experience smell is a very important element when it comes to dining|ellen pizza and a spring mix chicken feta salad you dont need anything else we taken several friends here and night and all agreed its good food no only reason i dont get five stars is because sometimes the staff is so friendly and they could use some tidying up|stopped to get some steaks and tried the restaurant pleasant surprise ambience is a little like eating at home today they had beef and noodles as the special it was terrific for two meals and sodas  not bad good alternative to the normal deep fried menu you see at most places|fillys is one of the few places that offers entertainment  nights a week year round even during the slow summer season during the period from december to april they also offer live bands in the afternoon from  on the weekends weather permitting this is a blessing for a permanent resident like myself they are able to stay in business because of the large number of snowbirds that reside in aj and mesa during the winter if you want quick service or fine dining you should probably go elsewhere same goes for handling large parties the negative reviews regarding service are probably deserved the kitchen is small and when  customers show up on a weekend you will have to wait i have always found the staff to be cordial but then i am a regular|service is always a hitormiss here some days i go in and i am treated like i dont exist and others i meet a wonderful employee who is super helpful there were two women by the names elyse and alyce lol i met and they were wonderful products always a plenty i just wish all employees had the same level of great service|actually havent been

with au jus dipping sauce with a side of fruit the service was timely and the waitress was very polite the sandwich was ok both the french dip sandwich and the au jus came warm the toothpicks in the sandwich however did not aid in keeping the sandwich together however the taste of the sandwich was hearty and comforting the fruit on the side tasted fresh so no complaints for that the meal itself was reasonably priced so its a great value tooa great place to go for some traditional american food great atmosphere great staff and great food|ive never had a problem with this location so im surprised by the reviews i think ive dealt with some awkward cashiers but thats about it food is always cooked and safe to eat fast food joints vary by who works there although i cant wait for

closed portion of this article|the casino is kind of old looking  i sure expected more they make so much money they should invest some back and get it renewed and beautified maybe hire more waitresses cause we could not find them and end up going somewhere else|this hotel has taken a serious dive too many little kids in the casinoand i mean little a little four year old was lost around my slot machine crying at  am finally his idiot mother found him and guess what she started yelling at him i could not believe it where is casino security the other turn off are the number of women parading around the casino in their bathing suits drunk around all these little kids i witnessed one of these drunks literally messing with one of the little kids behind her and her parents back one of her huge nasty butt cheeks was hanging out she was barefoot staggering and spilling her drink everywhere twoyes two mgm security guys walked by her one of them actually turned around to check out her butt i am not a prude and i understand that is a long hall to the pools from anyones hotel room but i think that the other guests in the hotel are allowed a certain amount of respect it seems like the mgm is attracting a much lower class of people geez|the beds were very firm and the pillows too the room was  nice and clean very noisy in the halls at night the staff was excellent no problems therethe casino was a problem when security is there it was fine as well as the other employees on the floor but as soon as they moved to another area the hookers came and bothered you this never happened before  drunks too  i came to mgm for gambling not hookers  we went to see the aria a drunk wanted money from me while i was playing a machine that really scared me  he was in my face big time no security in sight   my friend played the same machine for over  hrs and got dozens of bonus rounds and always got the same prize  cents  it happened to me on a different type slot  we thought it odd the same lousy prize so many time i played quick hits for a long time too and had the same problem  we both thought the games are rigged its no fun any more i was at the wynn and there were no hookers or drunks bothering us at all had a nice relaxed time  if i can afford it i might stay there next trip or try the bellagio we went to see the aria and i was playing a machine  a drunk wanted my money  there was no security any where  we left las vegas is not as much fun as it used to be|the food is an ok deal pretty good burgers and the chicken pot pie is surprisingly good for about  a meal  they have a pretty big menu which can be nice for groups food is also pretty good not bad but just above averagethings like the poutine are a great addition to the menu and madisons food scenedownside you have to order food to sit in the beer garden youd think ordering beer would be the requirementbeer is hit but a few times ive had a miss sometimes it is flat or stale usually it is great and fun to

legit the place looking nice  the soda cups all had water spots in them  it was hard to find a decent looking chip at the soda bar   desert selection looked ok  i added caramel pecan sauce to my

early  also the beer of the month  pint is a great deal for a beer outside of happy hourthe brats here are as expected pretty good but not mind blowing  the cheese curds area also above average  all in all it is a solid and dependably good place  the  for  burger night mondays is great  if you go with the salad option with the meal the salad is great not just lettuce and huge adds a lot to the meal|i really enjoyed this show but i have nothing to compare it to since this is my first cirque du soleil show the stage is awesome  very unic and versatile the acrobatsdancers are fantastic the show is very creative only four stars  because there werent enough acrobatics in the first hour of this show  having said that  i do recommend this show to everyone its really amazingbtw i bought

what you get servers very nice|walking through the paris hotel you cant miss this parisian style street cafe with its large outside patio diningthere was no wait when we walked in for lunch and we were sat quickly  the decor is cute and if you dont pay attention to the nearby sounds of slot machines you might feel like youre in francei had the soup sandwich combo  with french onion soup and half a turkey croissant sandwich  this hit the spot the soup was tasty and had that perfect gooey cheesebread on top the croissant sandwich was fresh and the applewood bacon made the sandwich that much betterour server dennis was the icing on the cake he was incredibly friendly from start to finish and continuously checked up on us throughout our meal  he reminded of a cool grandpa who would pull a coin out from behind your ear  i would come back just to say hi to him|this place is great nd time here the price is absolutely affordable great dim sum and a pretty good selection this is not  star dining so i dont know what people are complaining about its dim sum for crying out loud  the carts are pushed around often good selection to choose from friendly staff what more could you want ill be back soon|glad i made it before it closed  of course this review is late comings but still  all the employees were very nice  i politely declined the  upgrade of my popcorn size thoughthe theater was what i remember as a kid the downward sloping style as opposed to the built up arena style  the sound system and screen were just fine  i liked that i could sir in the back and get a good view which i am sure is more difficult when theres a packed househopefully the new camelview inside fashion square will continue the legacy  love my commemorative pin|we came in for a lateish dinner hey its vegas late is a relative term the service was alright but the food was just okay i had the loco moco and the rice was inedible it tasted as it had burned and only the charred bits were removed the hot dog was supposedly good but seemed like little food for the price|adorable little place with amazing customer service the menu is simple and well made i enjoyed the house made mini jams on the table highly recommended for a casual meal|this place has the best pancakes i have ever tasted the sage chicken is really good but the sauce maybe a little hot for some corn beef hash was very tender with excellent favor not washed out like some corn beef hash service was excellent popular place might be a little wait be prepared to take lots of food home they have big portions|this place looks like a brokendown shanty shack on the border it hasnt been dusted in years and it took a few minutes between being seated and seeing our waiterthat being said the food was amazing i would give  stars on food for sure the prices are what youd expect on the strip but they have a few inexpensive options specifically breakfast i had the chicken enchiladas and was blown away by the flavorplease for the love of the gods clean your decorations i know you are going for the cobbled together look but it looks like you take no pride in your place dusting would have given you  stars|food was very good service was attentive atmosphere was very oldschool and outdated pricing was sky high for what we received will not be going back|they say you cant get into the raos in nyc but when in vegas you gotta try it so i did and i am glad i didvery good food  just like you would expect from a good italian restaurant maybe a little over rated but definitely very goodso just for the hell of it i also tried the raos brand jarred pasta sauce from the grocery store  you know what  not bad|a long time ago this place had an actual museum and sample tasting but that has long since gone the wayside to being just a gift shop and a for purchase drink and float shop on the second floor the first floor has t shirts and small souvenirs the second floor you can purchase coke floats and various drinks sold around the world you can get a tray or two of samples it appears that most do not finish the samples and most leave the samples only slightly finished at the tables there are some very pricey items on the second floor so if you are one who is looking for something unique or different this is the place to go very clean and has a very helpful staff to assist you can even get a picture with the coke polar bear on your phone but they will also try to get you to purchase the same photo upstairs in a frame you can even get a t shirt that smells like coke that people can go up and smell your shirt sort of like scratch an sniff lol| hour coffee shop winninglove this place lots of areas to get stuff done and some great sandwich names too unfortunately not a huge tea or ice tea selection but i definitely approve of the groove here|i have always loved godiva for years especially since my friend used to work at one their chocolate is delicious and the staff at this location are extremely friendly the display has all kinds of seasonal chocolates and if you join their rewards program you get a free chocolate every month i got the hot chocolate and it was by far the best hot chocolate i have ever had it had such a rich chocolate taste and didnt taste like watered down cocoa mix from the store its  and comes in a small cup but its worth it for the quality they also have softer serve at this location which i have yet to try i hear its amazing and i cant wait to try itthe prices are a little steep on the chocolate but you are paying for quality this place gets crowded around holidays so if you are in a hurry steer away|well it started off gooduntil the hostess skipped us for a seat  she gave us a pager and told us it would be  to  minutes for a seat close to  minutes went by so i walked up to ask what the deal was she looked clearly confused she told me someone else had come up with the same pager numberhow is that possible she apologized but cmon seating people isnt rocket scienceor is it apparently she wrote the wrong pager number next to my namei spoke to the manager about it and he seemed to somewhat care half heartedly but also implied i maybe had set my pager down somewhere and two dudes picked it up and took our place in linefirst of all how did i still have a pager when i walked up to the hostess stand secondly i dont know who would set a pager down somewhere and forget about it if theyre seriously waiting for a table i had my grandmother with me wanted to take her to a nice christmas eve breakfastthe pager never left my hands me setting my pager down somewhere makes no sense and hes bogus for believing the hostess who fed him that liei guess  girls working the hostess stand isnt enoughmaybe they need  girls up there to make sure the job gets done properly i ordered the french toast my grandmother had the eggs and bacon we enjoyed our food long story short the food was good our waitress was good but the service left something to be desired|bruce brown catered my wedding at the desert botanical garden  based on the other caterers that were in the running bruce brown was far and above in quality and taste of food  my guests raved that the catering was the best they had ever tasted at a wedding  i felt that for the price the menu was outstanding and of far greater quality than the price we paid  the only issue was with a matter of professionalism during one interaction which was quickly rectified when brought to attention  it would have been nice to not have to deal with any sort of frustrations to begin with  however everything was perfect the day of   all in all very delicious food that was superior for the price and a caterer that i highly recommend|hand car wash for  bucks you cant beat that thay do a ok job of

way|after i wrote my review i contacted as to give them one more chance to deliver the remote or else get a refund for it they had a unit coincidentally in stock and made an appointment to come out the next morning to install it it took about  minutes to complete and everything is in working order as also called later to followup and left a message to make sure i was satisfied for this reason im bumping up to  stars while overall were happy with the work quality and the employees are pretty friendly i just wish i hadnt had to chase them down over the last six months to get everything done|the bright lights and overhead led display make this a oneofakind experience it is totally free to walk through the experience and within the shortwalking distance there is from endtoend there is a lot to experience its totally worth having to pay for parking valet or going to the parking garage would be the most convenient choicesthere are  performing stages many stores and restaurants and countless street performers painting dancing impersonators posing for photos and everything in between i find it absolutely amazing to see the rich diversity in the performances shops and people at fremont that pack the walkwaysa great place to go at night for a walk not for people who are sensitiveaverse to cigarette smoke there are a lot of homeless people here so be wary|ch has some cool clothes love the whole silver metallic accessories that are on their stuff and some of the designs are pretty unique i would say their clothes are pretty high quality and a symbol of luxuryi see some celebrities wear

one issue with one of the female young employees  just felt like she was being put out when i asked a question and asked for her to look again be very aware the parking here is horrible  busy and hard to get in and out of  hopefully it will ease up after the holidays|i still like krispy kreme doughnuts on occasion and this is one of the few remaining stand alone stores in vegasi think this was actually the first krispy kreme store to have opened in vegas about yrs agoi remember how far away this location seemed at the timein any case got their doz deal a dozen regular and a dozen assortedhave a friend that loves their kreme filled one not the boston cream but their icing filled one added a few lemon filled sour cream and maple ones to fill the mixnice quick fresh doughnuts what more could you want for a morning treat|went here for the first time a couple of days ago  quickly seated and service was attentive even though they were very busy food was of good quality  pleasant decor my wife said it is an older persons place but there was  a variety of clientele i would like to go back here again  good flavor to the food|the meat was perfectprobably the best i have ever eaten the bun was tasteless but still did not ruin the whole experience comments on my end their house sauce was nothing to remember and their burgers dont come with frieswho should i tell it to

up to the window he is driving and we got two seperate orders he asks her in the window how are you and she responds ive been better trust me a normal response i would have said the same thing then

haha|honestly have no idea about the place never played there but i did order a gift certificate in the mail for my little brothers christmas gift so he could go play i never received the certificate in the mail but today christmas eve i got a text from pepe asking if i got it i had not contacted them they just asked me i said no and a few hours later he hand delivered it to my door im giving  stars because the original certificate never made it to my house when i ordered it  days ago but when it comes to costumer service i cant rate them high enough thank you pepe|good not great definitely some of the best beer you can sip on in the burgh worth a visit|we are adults  we want to leave the kids at home and go have an adult burger with an adult milkshake  you want burgervana  big daddys will do the trick just fine there are plenty of beer options and a full bar  if you have to bring the nonadults then there are menu items for the entire family  just go here and enjoy  dcor  out of food   out of drinks   out of service  out of cleanliness   out of |service wasnt great but the food more than made up for it great local ingredients and perfectly paired dishes huge portions as well definitely a go to for hangover breakfast|i gave a  star because my nails look nice but i would prefer a nail shop that takes their time and the front desk girl dont ask the lady who just started on my nails if she is done the lady filed my nails short and didnt even ask before she started too busy and too crowded thats a good thing but not when you are the one getting your nails done and the lady is rushing to get to the next person lady was in a happy cutting mood she cut too much skin she did a good job with my gel mani and also my color change but i am not returning back they didnt even remember i asked to get my eyebrows waxed and i set up an appt so i didnt even get my eye brows waxedjust wasnt the right place for me |my wife recently enrolled me in a monthly membership at this massage envy after being a member for over a year  it is definitely money well spent  the front desk staff is always friendly and helpful and most of the massage therapists are top notch  after long nights at work it is certainly a relief to get a massage of the neck shoulders and back|good food good service good atmosphere  stars only because i dont consider brios fine dining but never had a bad experience there good portions as well|really wanted to like this place the service was alright and the interior is very trendy  the sushi however was expensive and really mediocre there are many better options in phoenix for what they want you to spend here sorry sushi place|this is a pretty good representation for japanese food in america i had a tonkatsu meal with tempura and my wife had an american sushi roll and an inarizushi the tonkatsu was cooked well but would have preferred some fatter pork  i love marbling the tempura was light and not overly battered and oily which was done really well i think some of the vegetable tempura pieces were not cooked enough but the shrimp was perfect the miso soup was lacking and seemed to be the typical instant miso soup with barely anything in it i didnt try the americanized maki that my wife had but helped with the inarizushi which tasted good the service was above average but nothing special  drinks were refilled in a relatively timely manner and we were checked onoverall i scored this lower since i am kind of picky with japanese food having lived in japan and growing up with japanese food as well as going to japanese restaurants from japan guam hawaii california and other us metro areas but this is a place i would go to again and recommend to others|yum so we were having thai withdrawal because flagstaff restaurants have been out of their ingredients anyway this was a breath of fresh air  highly enjoyed the green curry  so good their noodles werent bad either they have the actual thai noodles that flag doesnt i hope we go back before leaving|i really enjoyed my burger at blt as did my dining partner the burger was cooked to perfection and the fries were amazing blt is definitely on my go back to when im in vegas again the staff was helpful and friendly as well as attentive without being over bearing|for what it is japanese fast food it is really good the rice was cooked perfectly  the salmon in my role was tender and not fishy my companion got the teriyaki beef bowl lol carb option which replaced rice with steamed veg however it was swimming in saucenot so low carbother than that  it was quite tasty the sushi options are fairly limited and no sea weed salad but price is definitely right if youre wanting a fast meal good price rather than a fine dining experience this is the place|same ol buffalo wild wings as anywhere else so nothing too amazingthe place is clean floors are clean and staff are friendly food came out quickly and our server was very attentive this place reminds me of kind of like an upscale bar food place as they sell pretzels nachos and lots of finger foods there are tvs all over the place  claw machines and another game machine all in all im sure ill be back again soon|friendly restaurant with excellent portuguese chicken the fries are to die for they are like potato chips and taste amazing the chicken is pretty good but maybe not as crispy on the outside as i like it lots of combos and excellent if you want to share with someone overall great place to eat and i would definitely good back|i and a party of six others dined at the reubens location just west of peel street on saint catherine on a tuesday evening the place was packed the waiter who served us was an exceptional polite and informative young man who knew the menu insideout my personal opinion was that this was the highlight of the dining experiencefor starters we ordered our beverages and i received a coca cola that was flat this was a harbinger of the meal to come which i would describe as fair to middling the meal that i chose from the menu was the famous super sandwich the meal included the classic reubens smoked meat sandwich of  ounces of smoked meat on rye bread with mustard  as well there was a coleslaw with dill pickle and french fries for the price of while the smoked meat sandwich was ok i did not appreciate the french fries these were nothing more than mccains frozen french fries the kind that one finds in mcdonalds restaurants i found that this cheapened the plate and would have preferred a different cut of fries overall the dining experience was ok finally the location of this establishment is reflected in their meal prices which seemed to be somewhat overpriced for this type of restaurant and meal|we love going here whether its saturday night or a busy weekday the restaurant is clean and goodsized it isnt a fancykind of place  we usually order two chicken platters which are two chicken sticks with dressed cucumbers potato fries and pita all of this always goes well with a cherry cola that we split the food comes quick and good and it is always the same it is a classic in our family and we enjoy coming here|a bit disappointed although they have a variety of poutine variations to choose from it did not taste spectacular nothing really special about it|weve been here twice and both times were to take advantage of the allyoucaneat sushi its a great deal but the key thing to remember is that you have to pay for anything you dont eatheres a ranking of our favorite rolls  mostly just for posterity  z roll sweet american fuji roll crazy dragon black pearl tiger roll|due to the fact southpark mall is pretty close to me i often dont go to northlake mall as it is a little bit of a drive northlake mall is average in my mind offering a lot more midrange stores where southpark has more highend stores  the one thing that is somewhat annoying about northlake is the parking  it is so spread out and very confusing that there are always backups trying to enter and exit the mall  the food court offers a great variety of lunch spots but can get crowded around lunch timeas for the stores although there are so many i felt like the employees at every store were rude or not very happy about working  yes i was there most recently around the holiday season but they just seemed annoyed  no one asked to help assist with anything  didnt enjoy thatoverall northlake mall does the job for getting your shopping done  an added bonusthe surrounding stores outside the mall all great  you can get to target best buy old navy and others and enjoy lunch or dinner away from the mall at many places pf changs fridays etc|wasnt so thrilled with the quality of food bread stale and food average hyped up because of the venetian|ive been here many times and i absolutely love the food the soup i always order makes me feel better and the spam musubi is amazing my only problem is the people some times they can be really nice and other times there a little rude but hey the food is great|we happen to be here on a warm october yes i said warm lol visiting our son and baby cousin in college  the surf shack in the middle of a desert will catch your eye immediately  i love all the memorabilia  the staff was awesome  very friendlyit was warm and sitting outside in the heat with not even a slight breeze made it a rough first time experience  i dont know if their fridge was down but we were served slightly cooled canned sodas out of a cooler and the salsa that came out of the little soda fridge on the counter was starting to turn it kept exploding out of the mustard squirter container  the food was on point  the tacos and burgers were good but we couldnt fully enjoy it because we were sitting there sweatingif you dont sitting outside in the heat youll get the most out of your two hippies experience if you visit in the phx winter which i plan on doing next week  all in all though good food chill atmosphere  id definitely go back  just not when its hot lol|the food amount of different drinks and service is pretty good i had a seared tuna steak which seemed to be a pretty good portion everything tasted pretty good i also had a spicy mango caipirinha which was only ok i think a normal caipirinha with lime would have been a better choice but the picture in the drink menu looked good the server was pretty attentive and refilled our water glasses several times and checked on us the food here is pretty pricey and the two of us getting meals and one drink a piece was around  this is probably one of the best restaurants in the westgate area but i still think it is a little too pricey|we came here for my birthday dinner and was really looking forward to it it was our first time and were so impressed on how beautiful the place is we were sat at  and ordered drinks which came out pretty quickly we ordered our entrees soon afterour first  courses came out prompt and the cauliflower soup was spectacular this is the main reason i am giving  stars after we finished our first  courses it was about  there were  tables around us getting their courses at about the same time both tables got their entrees about  minutes later we were still waiting the other  tables got their dessert and coffee we were still waiting both tables paid and left and we were still waiting finally our waiter came over and told they had a christmas party and the kitchen was backed up which we found questionable since we ordered at the same time as the other  tables who had already been gone  minutes we finally get our food around  the broccolini was cold the scallops were room temperature the chicken was luke warm really disappointing our drinks and scallops were comped but it didnt really make up for not warm food and mediocre service on my birthday if everything had been great we would have come back again now we wont|i walked into us egg the day after ironman arizona  oki hobbled in and then gingerly very gingerly sat downi instantly asked for a hot chocolate with extra whip cream and my waitress did not disappoint  i was given a tower of sugary goodness which i ate a lot faster than my run pacei ate some combination of eggs meat and potatoes  in my postrace fog i honestly dont remember what it was called but i know that a i liked it and b i wasnt hungry when i was done which is quite an accomplishment the day after racing  milesif i ever return to az i would definitely go again|i had heard good things about this restaurant i decided to give it a try at lunch and ordered the shrimp pad thai it was drenched in too much sauce tasted way too sweet had a strange smell and was not spicy enough i asked for  and it had  kick to it i will no longer go out of my way to the north side to eat thai food|nothing more than okay and prices werent too wallet friendly skip the breakfast buffet|much much much too expensive for what it was  we had the  course meal with wine pairing  service was good though very slowly paced   hour dinner  the total for the meal for   wine tasting for  others were kids was  including tip  of the courses  were not great  were quite good and  were outstanding  i recommend not getting the oystersalso parking is difficult and hard to findthis place could be so much more than it is  and for the price it should be|delicious food we had the beef kebab falafel sandwich chicken tagine and chicken bastilla one thing  if you want the chicken bastilla you must order it a day in advance this seemed odd to me but the way the owner explained it was that the phyllo dough had to be scratch made still it would have been nice to show that on the online menu|this is my to go to spot for sushi in las vegas ive been going here since new years of  the price hasnt changed mich for their ayce and theyre open late which is nice i also like how they have a time limit considering how they can get busy fast and some people like to gorge themselves on foodi always get their seaweed salad here and their salmon skin hand roll even if i order a la carte these will be my prime items they do offer half rolls which is amazing since some rolls are like  pieces long food comes out promptly and they do mention that some items will take longer on the menu i usually get nigiri here and i have been always satisfied they also have a large variety of rolls to choose from if youre into all that their service is borderline okay to good theyre prompt and they bus plates fairly quickly if you make them available but they dont really have much personality or a smiling factor but considering the type of people who go into these type of restauarants i shouldnt be surprised they end up not putting too much emphasis on that so be sure to tipanyway point being i come back for the food and prompt service thanks guys|my husband and i went for happy hour on christmas eve everything was great the drinks were delicious the shrimp and grits were great the catfish was lightly fried the calamari was fried a bit too hard the customer service was wonderful as well we will return|in the center of the sprawl its hard to find places with much of an identity but this one seems to be pretty unique i really liked the service and the food was probably in the  star range we got breakfast my only complaint is that its a casino and its not that unique to deserve

hole on the wall or mom and pop mexican restaurant|ive heard so much about firebirds and see locations all over charlotte nc cant say i was overly impressed with the fooddrink selection but the service was great and very friendly in northlake|having lived in se asia for  years i was very excited to try this place outwhen a place advertises as thai and vietanemese i am a bit skeptical it is akin to putting indian and chinese food together the menu felt like a mishmash of places and dishesi got a stir fry noodle dish it was good but the flavors seemed a little dulled down not the flavor explosion i would expect from a se asian placepositives still solid se asian food and seems like an accessible way to eat this food for some and it also looks nice from the outsideservings are a great dealsize|we had really good service the only two things i would say is the calamari is not good and one of my sides were cold the side was replaced immediately with no fuss would definitely eat there again|if youre into this japanese kawaii culture this is the only place i know of in pittsburgh that can help you get your fix  to find your way into this tiny basement shop look for the sign near a minisidewalkalleyway off walnut and step down into it  the first thing youll realize is that youve never ever seen so many hello kitty things in your life  then youll realize theres actually more around the corner  i had no idea what the rest of the licensing was and most of it was in japanese but evidently there are other similar fads to hello kitty with their own merchandise lines of odd cuteness that may or may not have a practical use  this is a pretty popular shop judging from the parade of shoppers filing through the cramped aisle fawning over this and that cute and odd item  the cashier was very polite and ready to assist anyone who needed help  an interesting place to wander|went back for a couple of times this last week and was very impressed by not only the food but the staff  much better wo our grandsonsbut they even enjoyed it despite their typical kid behaviorloved the healthy chicken hash w egg whites on the first trip hubby had the greek omelet that morning  it looked so good that i healthied it up by switching egg whites tomato slices and took out the cheesestill looked and tasted great|we found this convenient little starbucks on our way to tough mudder

bring as a giftthe interior of the shop is really inviting feminine and trendy the pastries and treats all look very professional what a great little shop definitely coming back to try a macaron ive never had one but theirs look wonderful|they microwaved their breadbowl chili   which results in inedible rubbery bread  other than that the chili was fine   note they dont have bud on draft despite the sign|excellent chinese food  only been about  times but have not been disappointed yet  we were disappointed in a few dishes we chose because were deep fried and neither had vegetables  we left feeling like we bathed in a vat of oil  otherwise the food has always been exceedingly good  my son and i are very sensitive to msg they say they dont add extra to the dishes  so far we have not gotten sick thank you for being here in the qc|they always do a great job when ive been in for pedicures rarely do i have to wait too long|historically a great job on dry cleaning and shirt launderinghowever a recent order was not found at the time i went to pick it up the cleaners i believe should have notified me that they were trashing my clothes due to an untimely pickup they have my contact information including phone number and email addressso please dont assume that you will be notified simply because dry clean city sends many emails and has your phone numberwilliam l kennedywmlekengmailcom|wowi have never had a better experience in my life  the food here was great the service was impeccable  and the price was reasonable  though the idea of cooking your own food was creative unlike other places i know it made me uneasy and cautious of the food disease ecoli besides that i have nothing else against your restaurant i am looking forward to coming here again|good fast food mexican i really like their rolled tacos burritos are good too i will pick this place over filibertos everyday|my review is based solely on the christmas light display they do such a wonderful job decorating the whole place top to bottom that it is amazing we went here on a date and it gives off such a loving atmosphere they have a few displays up of the manger scene and a couple of other religious displays they even put on a little play even though its not entirely accurate this place gets crowded towards school break so i would avoid it like the plague around that time theres tons of free parking even though it may take a few minutes to find some if you just love free lights and an enjoyable free evening this place is worth checking out as for the temple part of it i have no idea|doesnt scream opulentvegas like the wynn bellagio or venetian  we booked  bedroom suite  large nicely appointed but it reminded me of a w hotel or a newer westin  certainly not a uberluxurious star resort on the strip  theres a reason why this hotel is consistently rated below the major star places in vegas  they dont go the extra milegood  great location at the center of the strip  lots of stuff to do inside the building itself  beautiful showerbath area  the level of detail in the construction was quite impressive it looked like they had a great qc person during construction  balcony was nicebad  on the strip so sirens were frequently heard even near the top of the tower  kitchenette was laughable  cigarette smell  no extra blankets or details typical of a  star resort  cheap iron blow dryer etc  cigarette burns on the tables  battered walls  some light bulbs were out  it may seem like im nitpicking but what do you expect for the price and touting itself as a five star place  the trump hotel is nicer more  star like and they charge half the priceconcerning the kitchenette  cabinets were empty and the room had fewer glasses than any other marriott ive visited  fridge was a stocked minibar with sensors so dont think about putting your champagne in there or youll knock over the  bud lights and theyll be charged to the room why is there a microwave  if the fridge was usable a microwave would make sense  im sure when it was first opened they had kitchen items in the kitchenette but they probably cheaped out and took them away  the room also had a slight cigarette smell with some fragrance intended to mask it  upon arrival it smelled fine but then when we returned later in the night it was more prominentoverall as my first visit to the cosmo i would have rather stayed at the venetian or wynn  it would have been less expensive and they just feel nicer  disclaimer  marriott platinum member|stayed for the  year anniversary deal and received a second night for  dollars great deal but not available anymore we stayed at the terrace suite which was very pleasant the rooms are elegantly designed but still have the contemporary feel and the balcony view of the strip was definitely the best part the only downside was that we were stuck on the th floor of a  floor building guest services was excellent every time we requested towels room cleaning etc they arrived in no time they were also really nice and didnt sit around awkwardly expecting to receive tips though we did tip them the only time they messed up was when we left the room a bit messy and they didnt clean it up completely they probably assumed we didnt want our stuff moved around but still should have tidied up the place more the front desk staff was also pretty good had terrible issues with marquee nightclub and the resort manager tried to help the best she could but couldnt bc they are an outsourced company the casino could use a bit of work many dealers werent the most friendly and the floor staff wasnt so helpful when you try to ask for directions and what not note there is no poker roomthis would have been a no brainer  star review but the casino brings it down they delivered the way a high end hotel should otherwise|so ive been there just do join some people and we shared a pitcher nothing more the waiter was quick and really friendly the burger and the poutine of our fellows looked gread and they said its amazing and the beer was not bad at all we took the lager good atmosphere maybe ill try the food someday myself the other references are pretty bad which makes me think about not going again nothing special tho but not bad at all|usually we love this place but on this time we had to take an evening appointment for our boys we have always gone during the day before and the night staff is awful well at least the two we got were my youngest son got an older blonde woman and she had the worst attitude as i tried to explain what we had done to his hair last time there were no notes on him for some reason she was so rude another stylist tried to intervene but backed off before things got unprofessional this woman started the haircut clearly in a tiff and ended up cutting my two year olds ear at least she slowed down after that but sheesh we brought in a picture of what we wanted for my older son age  and specifically said we wanted it kept long on top it was already really grown outwe even provided a picture well he now looks like frankenstein half his darn forehead is showing at least this girl was sweet but i will never go back in the evening again ugh so disappointed ive included photos of the beforeafter and the example photo we showed herat least it will grow back right|what a great cut of steak got a moscow mule to accompany this and a selection of lobster appetizers|during my last visit here i came around the closing hour ish so i didnt expect a lot of people to be here or for the staff to even be enthusiastic i ordered the pepperoni pizzawich pepperoni mozzarella parmesan with caramelized onions mushrooms garlic salt and pepper on a toasted wheat bun it was pretty good and tasted like i expected the only downside to this dining experience was that i ordered a hot sandwich but the pepperoni was a little cold in the center despite this my experience here was still pretty good i will definitely come back again|my fiance and i visit this restaurant often we love the atmosphere and variety of the menu  lately ive been addicted to the grilled cheese sandwich with tomatoes and bacon it usually comes with tomato bisque which my man always gets but i prefer the rich creamy clam chowder  we went last sunday my sandwich couldve been more golden brown but the bacon was super crispy and the cheese very gooey so that made up for it  the clam chowder was very hot and generous with the clams  service was ok i finished a glass of water and put the empty glass where the waitress could see it but she passed it many times before i stopped her and asked for a refill  well definitely be back|we always go to this place when we are planning on a chinese buffetit has the biggest selection  and sushialthough they have the typical chinese buffet desserts you can scoop your own ice cream here my kids love thatmy husband always gets something cooked on the hibachi grilli love their coconut chickenthe people are very nice dont forget to check out the fish and turtles up front|best late night happy hour in las vegas   captin jamesonlike bonkers awesome prices   ask for alex or annamaria |this restaurant has much improved since we went last year we were early sunday morning regulars but the place started lacking so we lost interest theres more staff the current people today were happy and attentive theres an updated menu in an easy to read fashion they still have their  pancakes and  egg challenge theyve updated the interior decor which is rustic and cool theres more seating outside to accompany the long lines with a hostess stand the hot chocolate was piled high with whipped cream cinnamon and cho sauce and i regretted not ordering one i did try the marinated beef tips which were marinated for hours in unicorn tears lol literally the tips were too overdone for me but my husband loved the dish it came with a biscuit and gravy which was fantastic i would add some sausage chunks to this though we also got the chicken and waffles and that was tender and perfect the orange juice has a lot of pulp just the way i like it i think we would become regulars again based on todays experience|we had dinner here for the first time last night we had a party of five and made reservations for christmas family dinner when we arrived they sat at a table in the middle of the restaurant one member of our party actually had to sit in the aisle way as we sat down i noticed they sat at a table of five who just walked in off the street at a nice cozy corner table for  this did alter my view of the restaurant for i wanted a nice christmas dinner for my family with good food and good conversationour waitress approached the table she seemed very nice and had a desire to service as well  unfortunately she did not seem to have adequate training to achieve this goal she try hard throughout the night to services but nothing seems to go right example we asked her about bread she said well sometimes the kitchen has it and sometimes it doesnt it just happens that way i thought this was an unacceptable answer they could have sent someone to the walmart just  mile away bought bread heated it up and served it it would have benn better than no breadonce ordering dinner it was served in a timely manner however our poor waitress continued to reach over diners to place plates in front of other diner at  this point i really started feeling sorry for her shes stranded on an island on her own trying to do a good job but not sure howwe thought the quality of the meals meet the price all the steaks came out cook as requested and there were no major concerns over any of the mealoverall it appears to me that this restaurant wants to compete with the upper end steakhouses the quality of their food achieve this goal  for which i give them two stars the quality of their servers only receive one star because even though they try hard they do not seem to have the tools to succeed i give management  stars because i feel they have been delinquent in training their staff throughout the two and a half hours we spent there for dinner i constantly scan the restaurant to see who was in charge i could not find anyone who seem to know what was going on in the entire restaurant no one address our table ask if the meal was good or if the food wad prepared properly i felt at a restaurant like this this was a huge faux pasas we left the restaurant two very nice employees wish us a happy holidays which i thought was great unfortunately they were standing right outside the exit on their smoke breaks which really makes me question management at this locationi wish this steakhouse the best of luck however i will not be returning with my family|the baked products are great and i would have a five star review based on quality however this morning i went in to get my wife a birthday cake their tiramasu cake is heavenly and thats what i was buying when i asked them to put a happy birthday message on the cake the clerk told me that they were too busy today to do that that is horrible customer service and i wrote this yelp review to make sure the owners understand that it is unacceptable customer service i have therefore lowered the rating to three stars because of the this lapse|the food was yummy but the place was kind of dirty the floor wasnt broomed so there were pieces of food all over for that i give  stars nothing wrong with the food though|well needed to get a quick bite and some coffee for the drive to cathis location is pretty convenient right near the  so easy to drive thru and get an order for the roadi know its only mcdonaldss but hey quick and cheap is good sometimesplus i had to make sure to get my annual mcribglad they only sell once in awhile because that way you wont get sick of this sweet gooey bbq reformed pork riblet  i still say yumgot a mcrib evm bought the extra mcrib for a buck and got large coffeethere was a bit of a line in the drive thru lanes but still ordered and done in  mins then onto the freeway to ca|this was the second time i have taken my siberian husky booboo in to be groomed the first time he looked great but wasnt quite as white in the face as normal and he was still damp at the base of his fur i called and let them know and they were very accommodating i took back in again and this is how he came out super soft fluffy and smelling wonderful his breath is better too  he was still slightly damp but nothing like the first time i know he has a ton of fur but i had taken him to another groomer for years who had him completely dry every time so i expect to get that i still very much recommend this place they are incredibly nice and do a great job|im not one to drink my noodle soup but how can you resist especially on a cold and windy night get the  and after drinking the soup youll have a nice and warm feeling in the pit of your stomach|excellent tapas place the paella is very tasty it would be perfect if there were more rice in the mix  food is in general too salty|yummy pizza that will satisfy you after a night of clubbing drinking or if youre looking for a snack this is located upstairs in the cosmo on the right side of where youd enter for their clubpool parties there isnt a name but instead a long hall with pictures that you walk down in luckily every time ive come here there wasnt a line you pick your slice they warm it up and you pay easy concept and quick bit to eat will run you about  depending on what kind of slice you get good crunchy texture but a bit oily guess thats what your napkin is for|pizza was decent not exactly mind blowing but a good snack if youre drunkthe success of secret pizza is its mystery factor  a neat idea  but the average pizza means this is just a one time visit for me|glutensensitives wingharts now has glutenfree buns  and theyre yummy ones  hooray  the food is really good and the menu very creative  its a little heavy  youll be dragging if you eat lunch here on a work day  and although i know everyones taste is different i do think they are a bit heavy on the salt  the menu is quite pricey but you pay for good fresh ingredients i suppose  the result  i rarely eat here but i always enjoy it  this visit i had the shipwreck burger  the meat was tender fresh and cooked perfectly with arugula brie cheese also melted perfectly white truffle aioli caramelized onions and bacon  i dont do burgers often but when i do i do it in style  lol  fyi i have heard complaints from others about the music volume being way too intense here|decent food although a bit hyped up and extremely meager portions good draft beer selection guinness competent friendly service and lots of outdoor seating id come back but only for a pint or two then id head a few miles south for some delicious thai food good times in aj|decided to check this place out due to the other good reviews on yelp and glad i did reviews are factual and coffee is worth making a visit|i had a good dining experience at wine  cafe i entered the restaurant during a weekday around lunchtime i was very impressed by the decor the flower arrangements statues and colors were something i had never seen before but it was nothing overwhelmingi was seated quickly in an empty dining room i believe i asked the waiter what was good or popular on the menu she suggested one of the heartier burgers and a side of vegetable logs i agreed to order what she suggested the burger came with a good time frame it was a very juicy burger but was not anything i thought was particularly special the vegetable logs which were various vegetables battered and fried were pretty tasty but a bit oilythis was the first time i was served african style food it left me with an impression of satisfaction i did leave with a full belly there is a vast menu ranging from tacos to seafood entrees i guess i have only scratched the tip of the iceberg when it comes to nairobi cuisine stop by to wine  cafe for a taste of africa|i went here around halloween pros i thought that the inside was really well done many of the rooms were cool our favorites were probably the airbag hallway and the spinning room the actors and actresses were playing up their characters and seemed to be having a great time cons it just wasnt scary there was just two of us and they grouped us with many other people it does say on the website that they may do this on busy nights the people at the front of the group may have been scared a couple of times in the beginning but we quickly caught up to the group in front of us and the group behind us caught up to us as well so we just had a long train of people walking through would have been much scarier if there was some anticipation of what was coming next or fear of something sneaking up from behind|found good fellas by searching for lentil soup in phoenix so i stopped by to try it ordered the gyro sandwich and falafel plate we loved all of it and will be back soon as for customer service it was excellent they made me feel like they were glad i was there and even offered me a complimentary bowl of potato soup which was excellent|
