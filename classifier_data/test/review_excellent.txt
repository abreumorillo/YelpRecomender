chimney sweep did both  clap  clap  claplets get to the good job shall we  i called and scheduled a chimney cleaning and a dryer vent cleaning for my house i have owned almost  years  i know nothing about chimneys and have no idea the last time my dryer vent was cleaned  i got a discount over the phone when i scheduled both  awesome money savedso here was a huge perk they did a saturday appointment at a good time  lady on the phone was nice  our guy called me about  minutes before my appointment said he was running early and asked if it was cool that he showed up early  what was good is he said i know this is earlier than your scheduled time so if it is too early dont worry about it  however all i was doing was watching reruns of the simpsons upstairs and was home so i green light him coming over early i believe my technician was named mike  nice guy did not walk on my lawn had a beard that would have made chuck norris proud  here is where this guy and this company sold me  i scheduled a dryer vent cleaning with my chimney cleaning  mike walked to the dryer vent outside of the house saw that my dryer was directly next to the wall and told me it was not necessary to clean that as it is against the wall and explained why  guy actually told me and showed me how i can clean it myself basically just reach up against the vent and pull it out only need to pay for it if the dryer is not against an exterior wall and explained why  seriously this guy could have just hooked up a shopvac to to it and did nothing and lied to me that he was doing something and surfed the net on his cell phone and i would have bought it  he didnt treat me as an idiot and did not rip me off  saved me  bucks or so  thank you and well donewhen he got to work on the chimney told him i bought this place about  tears ago never looked at or used the chimney  this guy had to move my couch and coffee table out of the way to get busy on it and i mean get busy  treated my furniture like his own  he had something around the chimney that collected any debris that fell out of it a big blanket or something  this guy really gave a damn about my house  after the cleaning was done actually took a few minutes and showed me how the chimney worked how to maintain it when they are not around and how to keep smoke from coming into the house  this guy really educated me on it  even gave me a quick follow up quiz on it and gave me a second demonstration on itso the second perk this guy did a number on the dirt and debris inside the chimney  he pimp slapped all the dirt soot and all the other ungodly things that have built up inside of it  if you have ever seen the show its always sunny in philadelphia mike was pepperjack and my chimney was his best ho  google it  bottom line this company could have ripped me off with a dryer cleaning  they did not and explained why and did not charge me for it  they went to work on my chimney and owned it  found my company  congratulations you now have a customer for life  take a bow and give mike a pat on the back  will use this company every year|very nice aaa office in the safeway shopping center i never noticed it before and its huge when

across mint indian bistro my suggestion is try it once for lunch buffet and dinner all you will find is consistency in taste quality and customer service yes there are multiple choices and this is about  mins away from the strip but with ample parking and great food its worth trying we are glad that we stopped by this placeps gets super busy so call  hr in advance|so it is not common for me to write reviews on establishments that i have attended but the experience i had at casa di amore was so exceptional i couldnt help but to spread the word this place is a must for anyone and everyone in vegas this restaurant has managed to hit all the hallmarks of a classic italian american eatery the staff was amazingly accommodating the food was outstanding the vibe is that of old vegas with pictures of retro casinos adorning the walls and the music made me think i was listening to frank sanatra himself starting with the staff you can tell they truly care about the place they work and that customers have an enjoyable experience next i had a couple different appetizers they were all good but the star of the show was a fresh baguette topped with fresh mozzarella and prosciutto just wow this establishment can handle tables of  seamlessly and the owner michael made sure to stop by every table to ensure we had a great experience as a result i will now be going to this restaurant every time i come to town also i found out they offer a limo service that will take you out there conveniently which is a huge plus i made sure to take a stack of business cards and hand them out to anyone who wanted a one of a kind experience again i cant begin to bolster how great this place is|this is one of the better mom and pop restaurants in town  i really like the food the customer service and the atmosphere  i used to come here all the time  i eat here much less frequently since i moved to a different part of town  the orange chicken they serve here is very unique  its just like eating a fillet  this is a very traditional style restaurant  i would prefer this place over panda express any day if the week|great local sports bar with excellent friendly staff steel darts

shoes clothes to hair productsmakeup i usually come to shop for shoes they have a fantastic selection of heels work shoes and boots during the fall i always find nine west and jessica simpson heels for  or less they also have great designer ties for men michael kors and calvin klein just to name a few for  or less i know this only from getting gifts for male coworkers im sure nordstrom rack also has a great variety of button ups suits dress shoes and morethe service is always incredibly friendly the workers are quick to answer any questions you have and the cashiers always wear a smile when checking out its located in henderson on stephanie between sunset and warm springs its a bit of a hike from where i live but well worth the drive for all the great buys|thanks to pam for bringing my botched bob from the day before back to this centurywas very patient and accommodating in getting my haircut right very happy with my experience will definitely return|i love this place its pretty hip and its got a really good vibe the drinks are so yum and the whip cream is so good they are a little stingy on the whip cream but make sure that you ask for some if you dont you will regret it also i had the coffee cake and the breakfast egg cheese tomato and bacon sandwich holy molyso tasty|the service was great as always we started off with  pew pew platters and we all shared entrees the food was great plenty left over and we had no room for desert the hot tea was perfect for a cold evening|we had a pretty good size spread garlic prawns  not sure what all the hype is but not going to order again they were just okay eat the shells and theyll get stuck in your teeth combination fried rice  good worth buying again this was probably the only thing that wasnt deep fried crispy duck panang  worth  stars it stole the show now this baby was definitely worth buying again and again i should have placed an order of this to go i didnt see it on the menu but luckily i was able to pull up another review photo it was delicious  drunken noodles  if i cant remember the meat in it does that tell you anything this is why i went in the st place noodles were stuck together may order one more time to see if it was just the cook chicken pad thai  flavor was good but noodles were smaller than most thai places i have visited stuffed chicken wings  omg i could have eaten  of these as a meal my jaw dropped when i saw bill and realize we paid  for  but i think i will actually order this baby again fried bananas and ice cream  actually it didnt come together they charged us separately for it come on now all in all we spent  total with  beers and  wine glad we went sampling but now i know what i will and will not order next timesuggest making reservations we had about  people ahead of us standing in line before it opened they have some funky hours lady said it would be an hour wait but it was less than  mins glad we waited|epic burgers if you want burger luxury this is the place i consider myself an apprentice of all things meat and thus have been educated further by the wagyu beef burger covered in a red wine shallot reduction sauce i consumed i did also take notice of lamb and buffalo burgers on the menu along with your standard meat fair and grass fed options available i will be back god willing for thosefries and assortment of standard toppings such as avocado and somewhat less standard such as truffles and foie gras are also available the only meat better then this comes straight off the bull come hungry|ive seen penn and teller a few different occasions but they never cease to amaze me they do not have shows every night of the week nor are they guaranteed to have a single show each week this is because one show grosses enough revenue that they arent hurting for more money last night my boss treated us to some pretty decent seats as an early christmas present i avoided the bar area because beers were going for  a piece however this isnt a review of the bar so i will leave that part out of my rating i arrived a bit early and had about  minutes of fun enjoying a smooth jazz pianist mike jones play his heart out as we were entertained by the music audience members that wanted to be a part of the act signed an envelope on stagei did not but this certainly did not prevent me or anyone else from accidentally being a volunteer during the act we never had an issue hearing penn or other guests from the speakers their microphones worked beautifully the stage presence and comfortably penn and teller have with each other is truly phenomenal but this is no surprise when you consider theyve spent  years work with each otherlet me summarize some of the great tricks you might see cold readings in the form of jokes things disappearing card tricks ladies cut in half rabbit pulled out of a hat  you know the usual and likely ending the night with a bangif you feel like i gave anything away go to the show and youll see that my spoilers are quite small after the show if you are a serious fan you will have the chance to take a picture with these legends i would have if i wasnt so darn hungry|amazing unlike any mexican ive had before stopped in for a quick lunch in caesars and was amazed by the variety of the menu my partner had the tuna tartare nachos and i had the spicy chicken and sweet potato hash with poached eggs and green chile hollandaise both were delicious beautifully plated and arrived quickly was impressed enough to splurge on dessert and took the servers recommendation for the deconstructed banana cream pie obviously tequilas and margaritas are a specialty but its worth noting that the beer and whiskey selections available are obviously well curated to go with the restaurants flavor profile and high quality|this is the best food we have had in vegas the tuna nachos were nice chunks of tuna in a great sauce one of the dishes was mahi mahi cooked to perfection the lamb chops were fabulous there is real attention to detail the house made ice cream came in a ravol dish an expensive french bakeware line i wanted to take it home deanna our server was terrific she is really invested in wanting us to have a perfect experience she explained the menus in detail and also informed us on how bobby flay looks over the restaurant he is involved in all details  it shows no more encore restaurants run to mesa|always delicious always a classic pros food is delicious decently sized portions fun areas to sit in trivial pursuit cards at the table no problems getting seated on weekdays casual ambience room for lots of people my group once was a little inconsideratewe had  people that kept getting bigger once we were seated but the manager really helped us out reminding us to reserve for more people if we needed to i completely understand if youre going to have a big group call ahead and make a reservation cons cash only crowded on weekend mornings until  or  duringafter finals week parents weekends and days of sports events all usually on weekends|ive never had a bad experience there are two wonderful girls here who are usually our servers and they are absolutely amazing always so nice and

our waitress linda was awesome on the venetian one|ive been coming to this place not as often since my schedule is jacked up for over a decade and i cant say enough great things about it its a henderson cheers where everybody knows your name  or at least your face  and you can hang out and have a beer or enjoy the wine tastings on thursdaydespite being a smaller place the prices are amazing and the owners issa and nura will do special orders for you if theres a wine you simply must have but cant find anywhere  so im jumping on the much love bandwagon this is the best place ever|beautiful resortbeautiful view from our room fantastic service great resort to spend our christmas holiday|we had a dinner buffet it was really good being a indian i am always comparing to real indian meal i liked it to my taste i would recommend it to everyone|i usually eat at mon ami gabi when i am vegas this time we were staying at the paris so it was  even easier but its an expensive place and not necessarily convenient as everyday food the cafe is easy and fast its really like a french cafe feel i guess you get different a different waiter all the time and your experience will vary i love the croque madame its a french hot sandwich made of soft bread cheese and ham that alone is the croque monsieur topped it with a sunny side up egg and its called croque madame i tried it twice and really loved it i am french and i am always very skeptical to eat so called french food the croc as we call it is very soft i like the bread used not your usual toast bread its thicker and very soft if you know croque madame you need to try this one i also had napoleon which we called mille feuilles its a bit different cream inside usually its made of custard and not whip cream  it was not too sweet so i liked it the chocolate mousse was really good in conclusion we enjoyed our food got twice good service like the convenient location closest place to eat when you stay at the hotel you are outside whatever the weather is|we stepped into noodles for dinner couple of days back they had a long line for tables but were ready to seat us at the counter not a great seat location but definitely worth it if youre hungry we ordered sesame balls malaysian style roti prata for first course and they were delicious for the main course we had penang style noodlesveggie version with tofu and veggie fried rice we loved both the service was slow but that might have been because the restaurant was packed our waitress pauline i think was great  super friendly and kept checking on us frequently overall the experience was great and the food was amazing will come back again|always good food and service get the potatoes for breakfast with your order theyre the best|i had been wanting to try this place for a while and finally stopped in today for christmas eve lunch soooo happy i did i ordered the catfish which came with grilled veggie kabobs and the most delicious rice with slivered almonds and raisins the service was excellent fast and friendly the food was fresh well seasoned and the portions were generous i ended on a sweet note with the baklava the layers of phyllo dough were flaky and it wasnt overly sweet which is a good thing a lot of times it can be soggy and super sweet this wasnt it was perfect i cant wait to go back|it was our first time here service was great food was fantastic atmosphere is relaxing my hubby and i enjoyed it|christmas eve dinner i wasnt in the christmas spirit and stephanie changed that hands down best service ive ever had that says a lot ive traveled ive been in the industry for  years as a female in male dominated establishments you made my day stephanie great food warm informative service i watched the floor great teamwork both back and front i grew up in chicago going here and this is the best one ive been to|excellent  we went during happy hour and had the appetizers that were just filling enough i had the bacon seafood chowder lots of potatoes and lobster and corn creamy base both lois and i then had the crispy fried shrimp with red chili sauce on the side it had a bit of a kick to it so a little goes a long way but the shrimp had a light tempura batter fry and it was tasty without any sauce we toasted with a glass of prosecco the deserts looked lovely but we were full  dinner wise a little too pricey but for a light early dinner the appetizers make for a nice meal|beautiful room we got the balcony  bedroom stunning accommodation free valet parking great view best value for dollar we have ever spent on a hotel|it has been years since i set foot at olive  ivy mainly because i had been distracted by lifes other attractions  a friend reintroduced me to o  i this past weekend and i couldnt believe how much i had been missing out  its just an authentic large but quaint space  from inside to the outdoor patio all you can see is happiness and tastiness  we were a rather surprising large group of chatty women but mark our patient waiter served us graciously  olive  ivy go there for a happy time|this is a terrific place but since i live way in the wilds of the far nw of vegas i cant get here as often as id like which is probably a good thing considering that every single time i stop there my budget takes a serious hit  cheeses and wines that you cannot find anywhere else somehow end up going home with methe specialty cheeses and meats are a little on the pricey side but what youd expect certainly not ridiculous and the wines are very well priced  so its hard to know where to put them as far as prices are concerned  i would say overall very reasonable especially when youre contemplating say that rare cheese made by monks in the alps of switzerland who only allow it to be shipped once a decade yeah that may be a slight exaggeration but that gives you an idea of the quality of cheeses that they offer|first timer the family dog greeted me as i entered the shopgot some cave aged cheese crackers fig ham and a great bottle of frank family zinfandelby the way a tout for this whine for the holidaysa little more pricey than other zins but well worth itvery nice owners and knowledgeable service the cheese is gruyere and it is awesomemerry christmas|best oyster bar in town hands down been going here for over  years the only downfall is the wait so i always plan around busy times but it is open  hrs  everything on menu is awesome and you cannot go wrong|this place definitely lives up to the hype and is well worth the wait lines at night are usually a  hour wait but if you go at around  theres no line pan roast soooo good not too creamy and rich like other places which is good theyre not skimpy on toppings either and everything is so big shrimp and crawfish i prefer getting it with linguini instead of rice because i feel the rice makes it too porridgey the spice level is from  and if youre into spicy i suggest getting an  because i almost cried eating it but it was still really good oysters so darn fresh and juicy you see the chef cut them fresh open right in front of your eyes half a dozen for  best oysters ive ever hadoyster bar is a definite must when visiting vegas although the wait might be long i promise you its well worth after eating this places like ritters doesnt compare|best service of my lifei kid you not i left nove feeling like the freakin queen of the universe their waiters managers receptionist everyone there is absolutely pleasant nice funny and incredibly accommodating the venue gorgeous wonderful view the food amazing ok so i know this is an italian place but i actually ended up ordering a steakand this ended up being the best steak ive ever had yes better than any actual steak houses ive gone to the appetizers and desserts that our group ordered ended up being equally as good there are days that i have to talk myself out of driving the  hours it would take me to get to vegas when im craving this bomb food considers driving over there once

pleased to have tried this place their laksa is very good comparable to those i have had in singapore we also got some stir fry noodles and they were awesome in short this place has good food and good ambience i secretly asked ginatheir staff that day if i can buy a dessert and have them put a candle on top of it for my sister in law and she said she would do it for free awesome shes very sweet the dessert we got was a sorbet topped with fruits and it was the bomb they even sang happy birthday to my sister in law if ever im in vegas again im definitely coming back|omg  mac king is wonderful  an amazing magician get front row seats and you will still be totally baffled and hilarious comedian  and relatively family safe some silly slight sexual references but they are pretty innocuous for the young who wont udnerstandimo mac is one of the must see acts in vegas and you can get discount tickets if you look at harrahs   great show  great talent|this place has the best thai food in las vegas we always order the garlic pepper chicken papaya salad and the shrimp fried rice the garlic pepper chicken isnt that garlic or pepper it has chicken placed on top of a broccoli bed its very tasty it has lots of flavors the papaya salad is great we get a spice level of   and its a great level for me the shrimp fried rice is one of my favorites it has great taste in the cookery and has lots of veggies and shrimp this place was great in general  stars all the way|fabulous dinner at tonight with my man lobster dinner and he had the lamb chops it was unreal and our server was fantastic will definitely come back here what a great evening|this place is awesome brings back memories when i was a kid and is so much fun|located mandalay bayhappy hour  every day from  pm to  pm yummyok this place has it all well almost the husband and i decided to treat ourselves to a nice little dinner we were super happy to know that this place also has happy hour so we showed up for that  i ordered their white sangria unfortunately i should have maybe ordered some wine the sangria was not tasty because it was soooo sweet not my type of drink but maybe others would like it i would say skip the sangria and stick to wine or beer we ordered the smoked hummus for appetizers that hummus was good you had the nice smokey taste in it without being overwhelming the pita bread was tasty too and warm as for dinner we were hoping to get their prefixed dinner but unfortunately we found out after seating down for dinner that they no longer had it we were started with their well known complimentary duck fat fries that are served with different dipping sauces i love fries so no matter what i knew they would be good we also ordered the yellow tail sashimi super duper fresh served with a bit of cucumber slices and some crispy rice and a little hint of chili best yellow tail ive ever had i would have been one happy girl with two more orders of this all for myself and im not one to choose fish over beef   for main dish we ordered oz of mishima reserved wagyu rib eye this is the first time ive ever had wagyu and it for sure set the standards high the meat was cooked to perfected and to order way juicy and oh so very tender  we ended our dinner with the beignets these are so not the disneyland beignets we know but holy crap are they bomb that macallan  butterscotch sauce i want to swim in it that sauce that sauce that sauce i am not even a btuterscotch person so i am glad i gave it a shot with an open mind because i was blown away highly recommenedwhen they give you the check they give you a little bag of popcorn on the house nice little extra touch great place for a date make sure to call to make reservations|i had the famous grilled chicken salad and it was one of the best salads ive ever had in my life the wait staff was attentive and the cocktail i picked long island ice tea was strong and well mixed if youre trying to decide between the white chocolate brownie and the apple pie go with the brownie both are good but the brownie is great|good food at a reasonable price and great servicemade reservation thru open table and was immediately seatedservice was impeccablegnocchi was one of the best ive hadhighly recommended|just going back in my memory bank as my good friend calls it  recollecting on a good experience at the red rock hotel its located a bit outskirt from the strip perfect for me as im one of those rare peoples who likes to go to vegas to chill not to be hype lol i love this one stop shop you can do everything at this one location especially for you gamblers though im not condoning it i did see a lot of people playing on site of this locationfood was okay i believe there is a few restaurant options on site i love the outside patio warm fire pits under the star lit sky spa my massage left me speechless its been years and ive had plenty massages after still my most favorite massage was at the red rock the masseuse was attentive and applied the right amount of pressure superb communication didnt chat my ear off nor was she awkwardly silent thank god lastly the rooms were sized perfectly spacious living room comfy bed pretty much what is expected of vegas however i must say since they have the land they are able to make every room even the ordinary rooms feel like king suites i highly recommend making this hotel and resort an option for your next vegas stay|i love this place this is my favorite farmers market in the area i go here almost every saturday to get produce there are tons of great small farms here and they will happily tell you all about what they grow and how they grow it they love what they do they care about the community and most of the farms are organic and nongmo at lot of the farms grow heirloom varieties of produce that you wont find in a supermarket my goto places abby lee farmstomatoes community exchange table crooked sky farms and golo farms youll also find soap candles delicious baked goods paella pet treats and local honey here as well as local food trucks that are as knowledgeable about the ingredients in the food they make as the farmers are  its well worth the minute drive from my house|everybody already knows that the food at sprouts is always fresh and very healthy well most of it is healthytoday the employees at sprouts went the extra mile to make sure that we got what we wanted what we thought we had ordered online was not what we actually ordered we thought we had ordered a fully cooked prime rib but we had actually ordered one that was not cooked one of the employees from the deli area found us a precooked prime rib and now all we have to do is thaw it heat it and eat itwe had at least three employees helping us and we left with a very satisfied feeling that the employees were actually concerned about our situation and wanted to fix itgreat job sprouts|
