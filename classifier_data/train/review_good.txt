the burger was decent not the best in pittsburgh like a lot of people say the steak salad is really big and the steak is cooked perfectly so no complaints there the tables are kinda small so you feel a little cramped in there wait thats a common thing here in pittsburgh that im slowly discovering overall not bad no real complaints|beautiful things in this store too expensive in my opinion but my main problem with this place is that the two experiences ive had with the one owner he was extremely rude to me i happened to be in there when the store was closing i had been in there maybe  minutes and he turns to me and tells me that the store is closing and its time to go home now at first i thought he was joking but he was completely serious and quickly walked away from me like ive said in my other posts i love supporting small independent businesses but i dont appreciate being treated disrespectfully a little kindness and friendliness goes a long way which i disappointingly didnt receive here likely will not be shopping here again when there are equally nice and talented florists in the area not to mention cheaper|good pizza good service  please note  former review is a butt review just like a butt dial|this review is based only on three take out orders as i have not dined in the restaurant or checked out their buffet  i am a pretty simple indian eater naan and chicken tikka masala  their garlic naan is amazing always piping hot with just the right amount of garlic  i even love the subtle burnt end sometimes as for the chicken it is good but the spice level has varied ever time and they have never asked how i would like it  i have never been disappointed with the chicken white chucks of tender white chicken served with rice i hope to dine in soon but not sure about hitting the buffet not sure ill be venturous enough to try some of the items well see though as i love to give things a try|pretty much every other day i have a craving for chinese food lol we needed to refuel from the shopping and i found this place on yelp the reviews didnt lie this place was great it is tucked away in a really nice strip mall the decor in the inside reminds me of vegas but it is nicei wasnt a fan of the veggie rolls however the potstickers appetizer was really good pan fried i got the general tso chicken without the spice since you can alway get spicy dishes without spice it was really good i wish i had more rice on the side but that is okay the flavor was amazing  i was able to try the chicken lo mein and the flavor was amazing to me you never know how the lo mein noddles are going to be made but the way they made their noodles were great i cant wait to come back here next time im in charlotte highly recommend yum|this is my goto culvers whenever im driving between minneapolis and chicago its conveniently located right off of the interstate about  minutes north of all the madison exits and when you pull up outside youll immediately notice that the parking lot is packed with cars this is the sign of a good placeas for the food theres really nothing special about it i like the fact that the burgers are smash grilled and that the buns are buttered theyre not healthy by any stretch of the imagination but if i were forced to pick between mcdonalds burger king or culvers im going culversas for this location its clean and well kept and the staff are always friendly the bathrooms are also clean which is important for the weary traveleri cant give this place  stars because fast food chains certainly dont warrant that sort of rating but its quite solid nonetheless  stars|great museum embracing native american culture and highlighting the past present and future we came here for the frida kahlo photography exhibit and while it was a little smaller than i expected it gave some insight to and was a fascinating candid slice of frida kahlos life the other exhibits show various cultural items such as pottery tribal dress and religious art i especially loved the wall of kachina dolls seeing all the different spirits personified in doll form there is also a section for contemporary art and a large mural in the section dedicated to the various tribes that live in arizona one of the most interesting exhibits for me was the section on native american aid in our wars especially the code talkers in world war iithe heard museum also hosts various events such as a lovely chocolate festival i had attended a year or two ago and native american dinners admission for adults is  and free for native americans|missed this place for about seven years while i worked elsewhere it is every bit as awesome as it was when i worked downtown many years ago superb variety of menu items i go for the dietfriendly chicken tacos and the amazing salsa bar the staff recognizes regulars like me and theyre super friendly|houstons hillstonetheyre all the same  what you get is delicious food great service a slick atmosphere and an expensive tab  hillstone is the perfect business dinner or date night spot  the bar is nice and the patio is great  for the food you cant go wrong with anything but my go to is the french dip or the ribs|why would you go to a suburb for an expensive getawayi have stayed at the phoenician and royal palms and both leave me baffledthe royal palms is old  it is right on the highway and the car noise is prevalent  we got to the room and the best word i can use to describe it  no maybe two words  battered and tired  chipped paint  sticky topped furniture  nicked paint everywhere  and really really dark  they moved us and the new room is very nice but also a massive accommodation to us and not close to our original price categrory of  per nightyes as others have said the grounds are lovely  but it is still right next to a major thoroughfare so very loud  the pool is small  so is the fitness center  the shower has low pressure and the hvac system is incredibly loudour bed is sloped in the middle  the food is delicious  the staff is extremely responsive and helpfuli would not stay here again in its current state but if it were upgraded the food and grounds would make it returnable|service was great lobster potstickers yummy but the macadamia nut mahi mahi was a total disappointment overlooked but maybe it tasted that way bc it had been frozen promised with rice it arrived balanced on  cut potatoes sauce was a repeat of the lobster not like i remembered on kauai|christmas eve meal with my oldest daughter got tbone steak and eggs with red potatos  cooked perfectly and well seasoned and they know how to cook a good over easy egg without wrecking it latisha was my server she was decent i was happy to find a place open during these hours|very good food the menu is pretty limited so check before you go good seafood some poultry and minimal beef which we likedwinner of the night was desert the choccamisso  it was truly outstanding service was good and the hostess was welcoming in spite of the holiday crowd|when you walk in djs looks like a real ny style bagel shop theyve got the boars head meats the assortment of salads macaroni cucumber potato chicken pasta etc i was a little concerned when looking at the bagels displayed in the baskets against the back wall though i ordered an everything bagel with turkey cheese and scallionchive cream cheese they do have multiple options for turkey cracked pepper oven roasted hickory smoked and something else i went with the oven roasted they offered me a side and im assuming its because i got a lunch type of bagel therefore i ordered macaroni salad after checking out if ordering in you sit down and they bring your food to you execution of the actual bagel itself was lacking this validated my previous concerns the bagel was softer and less chewy than what you would get in ny on the sandwich itself the turkey was piled on which i appreciated but there was hardly any cream cheese i guess they thought they could skimp on the cream cheese since they used so much turkey also all of the everything toppings had fallen off or there hadnt been many put on in the first place i will say that the macaroni salad was on point|this mall is a bit ghetto but it has been getting betteri have lived near az mills for over  years and the clientele it brings in can be a mix this is an outlet mall so be prepared to find bargains around the holidays its always packed so be prepared to fight for a parking spotthe have a few cool stores like the giant forever  sanrio game works and hm although the store selection is getting better the area can be a bit run down at times there is also a movie theater here with an imax if you like big screens generally everytime i go here it is crowded and full of crying children so if you want a more quiet shopping experience i suggest going to scottsdale fashion square mall instead|so their mexican food is not the greatest and i insist on ordering for reasons i dont understand besides me craving mexican however my bf gets the gyro meat sandwich meal and i always get in on that action and its always great so i definitely recommend the gyro ive never actually had a steak here so maybe thats where i should be at since it is a steakhousethey always bring complimentary chips and salsa the chips are ok the salsa not so much it reminds me of enchilada sauce more than salsa their guac is way more liquidy which is a little disturbing i wish i could rank them higher because their staff has always been friendly but alas my lack luster feels for the foods overpowers the review|wings are great for every occasion  i love this place but if a girl name ashley takes your order over the phone it makes your experience rocky  she definitely needs to work on her language skills with customers  all you get is an irritating tone the whole time she is taking your order  if you dine in its great if you order take out i hope you get a better customer service experience then what i received|i dont know why any one complains about customer service or their services the wait was long due to how many people come here but when i was taken to the back the ladies were super nice and i will be returning when i am back in town|though ive been to various starbucks in the valley and they are all good the lake meadbuffalo location is my favorite ive never had the chance to in this particular establishment due to it always being fullwhich imo is a great indication that its good so i always go through the drive thru and they have been nothing short of excellent so with this location being great overall i wanted to shine some attention to the drive thru crew i want to commend the drive thru employees for being consistently stellar with their service|ok so after much heartache and inconvenience the regional manager contacted me and made a genuine effort to make things right he agreed to warranty out the two bad tires under manufactures defect straight across with an upgraded tire he also sold me  upgraded tires at a discounted price for the  tires that i still had that hadnt come apart yet so so far since i purchased the original  tires i have paid for  upgrades hmmm well

which was alrightit had pesto tomatoes cream cheesebut was a little bland my main course the buffalo pierogi saut was fantastic creamy delicious not nutritious of course but awesome my friends enjoyed their drinks and my boyfriend sampled a few beers which were decently sized and everyone could try themunfortunately the service wasnt the best we had a server named andrew who was pretty decent but we had to tell him at least  of  times to get us water to get other orders my friend had a coupon for a free pint glass through an app of hers and we told him at the end of the meal  minutes passed and i went to get him hed completely forgotten besides him this was a wonderful experience and id love to come again|small but almost everything you need i was recently in new york and did not need to bring back anything except doughnuts why because mak has it all here with many prices lower than ny standards the reason i gave  stars is because they have so much but some items take so long to restock not their fault but they have the game in town so no alternative other than to wait for what i need|the hotel is an historic beautifully maintained building  staff is friendly rooms clean and the bed was just awesome  slept better than normal  the room was very quiet the sheets and towels are great  i prepurchased a breakfast buffet ticket but there was no buffet  they offered anything on the menu but i dont think i got my monies worth on the breakfast  everything about the place is expensive  parking food room rate wifi  some other reviews mentioned very small rooms  i was in an upgraded single and it was very large but i paid extra for it  i would stay again|took awhile for the food but it was very good service was great well be going back|i waited at the northlake mall for

love that every time i call or visit the store i get great servicehaving an old version iphone i stopped in yesterday to see if i was ready for an upgrade unfortunately i was several months away

data over there were some issues with my contacts and photos but he was able to solve and by the time we were done everything was migrated smoothlyin addition i decided to exchange my old ipad for a new ipad mini again with a great offeri would definitely recommend stopping by even if you may not be eligible for an upgrade as they seem to have offers all the timethe manager and josh are great assets to the verizon team|quick service  of the time and  of their cabs are new and clean great job yellow cab for setting the bar high for other cab companies |you saved me on christmas eve   shop

always good when busy thai rama seems under staffed we just deal with it cause we live close and love the food but here is my main complaint and this is something all restaurants need to think about when it comes to cleaning use cleaning chemicals that do not smell more than once we have been to thai rama after pm and that is when a staff person decides to clean the restrooms the strong odor of bleach or whatever is in your products is so strongway too strong and it ruined our dining experience smell is a very important element when it comes to dining|ellen pizza and a spring mix chicken feta salad you dont need anything else we taken several friends here and night and all agreed its good food no only reason i dont get five stars is because sometimes the staff is so friendly and they could use some tidying up|stopped to get some steaks and tried the restaurant pleasant surprise ambience is a little like eating at home today they had beef and noodles as the special it was terrific for two meals and sodas  not bad good alternative to the normal deep fried menu you see at most places|fillys is one of the few places that offers entertainment  nights a week year round even during the slow summer season during the period from december to april they also offer live bands in the afternoon from  on the weekends weather permitting this is a blessing for a permanent resident like myself they are able to stay in business because of the large number of snowbirds that reside in aj and mesa during the winter if you want quick service or fine dining you should probably go elsewhere same goes for handling large parties the negative reviews regarding service are probably deserved the kitchen is small and when  customers show up on a weekend you will have to wait i have always found the staff to be cordial but then i am a regular|service is always a hitormiss here some days i go in and i am treated like i dont exist and others i meet a wonderful employee who is super helpful there were two women by the names elyse and alyce lol i met and they were wonderful products always a plenty i just wish all employees had the same level of great service|actually havent been

with au jus dipping sauce with a side of fruit the service was timely and the waitress was very polite the sandwich was ok both the french dip sandwich and the au jus came warm the toothpicks in the sandwich however did not aid in keeping the sandwich together however the taste of the sandwich was hearty and comforting the fruit on the side tasted fresh so no complaints for that the meal itself was reasonably priced so its a great value tooa great place to go for some traditional american food great atmosphere great staff and great food|ive never had a problem with this location so im surprised by the reviews i think ive dealt with some awkward cashiers but thats about it food is always cooked and safe to eat fast food joints vary by who works there although i cant wait for

closed portion of this article|the casino is kind of old looking  i sure expected more they make so much money they should invest some back and get it renewed and beautified maybe hire more waitresses cause we could not find them and end up going somewhere else|this hotel has taken a serious dive too many little kids in the casinoand i mean little a little four year old was lost around my slot machine crying at  am finally his idiot mother found him and guess what she started yelling at him i could not believe it where is casino security the other turn off are the number of women parading around the casino in their bathing suits drunk around all these little kids i witnessed one of these drunks literally messing with one of the little kids behind her and her parents back one of her huge nasty butt cheeks was hanging out she was barefoot staggering and spilling her drink everywhere twoyes two mgm security guys walked by her one of them actually turned around to check out her butt i am not a prude and i understand that is a long hall to the pools from anyones hotel room but i think that the other guests in the hotel are allowed a certain amount of respect it seems like the mgm is attracting a much lower class of people geez|the beds were very firm and the pillows too the room was  nice and clean very noisy in the halls at night the staff was excellent no problems therethe casino was a problem when security is there it was fine as well as the other employees on the floor but as soon as they moved to another area the hookers came and bothered you this never happened before  drunks too  i came to mgm for gambling not hookers  we went to see the aria a drunk wanted money from me while i was playing a machine that really scared me  he was in my face big time no security in sight   my friend played the same machine for over  hrs and got dozens of bonus rounds and always got the same prize  cents  it happened to me on a different type slot  we thought it odd the same lousy prize so many time i played quick hits for a long time too and had the same problem  we both thought the games are rigged its no fun any more i was at the wynn and there were no hookers or drunks bothering us at all had a nice relaxed time  if i can afford it i might stay there next trip or try the bellagio we went to see the aria and i was playing a machine  a drunk wanted my money  there was no security any where  we left las vegas is not as much fun as it used to be|the food is an ok deal pretty good burgers and the chicken pot pie is surprisingly good for about  a meal  they have a pretty big menu which can be nice for groups food is also pretty good not bad but just above averagethings like the poutine are a great addition to the menu and madisons food scenedownside you have to order food to sit in the beer garden youd think ordering beer would be the requirementbeer is hit but a few times ive had a miss sometimes it is flat or stale usually it is great and fun to

legit the place looking nice  the soda cups all had water spots in them  it was hard to find a decent looking chip at the soda bar   desert selection looked ok  i added caramel pecan sauce to my

early  also the beer of the month  pint is a great deal for a beer outside of happy hourthe brats here are as expected pretty good but not mind blowing  the cheese curds area also above average  all in all it is a solid and dependably good place  the  for  burger night mondays is great  if you go with the salad option with the meal the salad is great not just lettuce and huge adds a lot to the meal|i really enjoyed this show but i have nothing to compare it to since this is my first cirque du soleil show the stage is awesome  very unic and versatile the acrobatsdancers are fantastic the show is very creative only four stars  because there werent enough acrobatics in the first hour of this show  having said that  i do recommend this show to everyone its really amazingbtw i bought

what you get servers very nice|walking through the paris hotel you cant miss this parisian style street cafe with its large outside patio diningthere was no wait when we walked in for lunch and we were sat quickly  the decor is cute and if you dont pay attention to the nearby sounds of slot machines you might feel like youre in francei had the soup sandwich combo  with french onion soup and half a turkey croissant sandwich  this hit the spot the soup was tasty and had that perfect gooey cheesebread on top the croissant sandwich was fresh and the applewood bacon made the sandwich that much betterour server dennis was the icing on the cake he was incredibly friendly from start to finish and continuously checked up on us throughout our meal  he reminded of a cool grandpa who would pull a coin out from behind your ear  i would come back just to say hi to him|this place is great nd time here the price is absolutely affordable great dim sum and a pretty good selection this is not  star dining so i dont know what people are complaining about its dim sum for crying out loud  the carts are pushed around often good selection to choose from friendly staff what more could you want ill be back soon|glad i made it before it closed  of course this review is late comings but still  all the employees were very nice  i politely declined the  upgrade of my popcorn size thoughthe theater was what i remember as a kid the downward sloping style as opposed to the built up arena style  the sound system and screen were just fine  i liked that i could sir in the back and get a good view which i am sure is more difficult when theres a packed househopefully the new camelview inside fashion square will continue the legacy  love my commemorative pin|we came in for a lateish dinner hey its vegas late is a relative term the service was alright but the food was just okay i had the loco moco and the rice was inedible it tasted as it had burned and only the charred bits were removed the hot dog was supposedly good but seemed like little food for the price|adorable little place with amazing customer service the menu is simple and well made i enjoyed the house made mini jams on the table highly recommended for a casual meal|this place has the best pancakes i have ever tasted the sage chicken is really good but the sauce maybe a little hot for some corn beef hash was very tender with excellent favor not washed out like some corn beef hash service was excellent popular place might be a little wait be prepared to take lots of food home they have big portions|this place looks like a brokendown shanty shack on the border it hasnt been dusted in years and it took a few minutes between being seated and seeing our waiterthat being said the food was amazing i would give  stars on food for sure the prices are what youd expect on the strip but they have a few inexpensive options specifically breakfast i had the chicken enchiladas and was blown away by the flavorplease for the love of the gods clean your decorations i know you are going for the cobbled together look but it looks like you take no pride in your place dusting would have given you  stars|food was very good service was attentive atmosphere was very oldschool and outdated pricing was sky high for what we received will not be going back|they say you cant get into the raos in nyc but when in vegas you gotta try it so i did and i am glad i didvery good food  just like you would expect from a good italian restaurant maybe a little over rated but definitely very goodso just for the hell of it i also tried the raos brand jarred pasta sauce from the grocery store  you know what  not bad|a long time ago this place had an actual museum and sample tasting but that has long since gone the wayside to being just a gift shop and a for purchase drink and float shop on the second floor the first floor has t shirts and small souvenirs the second floor you can purchase coke floats and various drinks sold around the world you can get a tray or two of samples it appears that most do not finish the samples and most leave the samples only slightly finished at the tables there are some very pricey items on the second floor so if you are one who is looking for something unique or different this is the place to go very clean and has a very helpful staff to assist you can even get a picture with the coke polar bear on your phone but they will also try to get you to purchase the same photo upstairs in a frame you can even get a t shirt that smells like coke that people can go up and smell your shirt sort of like scratch an sniff lol| hour coffee shop winninglove this place lots of areas to get stuff done and some great sandwich names too unfortunately not a huge tea or ice tea selection but i definitely approve of the groove here|i have always loved godiva for years especially since my friend used to work at one their chocolate is delicious and the staff at this location are extremely friendly the display has all kinds of seasonal chocolates and if you join their rewards program you get a free chocolate every month i got the hot chocolate and it was by far the best hot chocolate i have ever had it had such a rich chocolate taste and didnt taste like watered down cocoa mix from the store its  and comes in a small cup but its worth it for the quality they also have softer serve at this location which i have yet to try i hear its amazing and i cant wait to try itthe prices are a little steep on the chocolate but you are paying for quality this place gets crowded around holidays so if you are in a hurry steer away|well it started off gooduntil the hostess skipped us for a seat  she gave us a pager and told us it would be  to  minutes for a seat close to  minutes went by so i walked up to ask what the deal was she looked clearly confused she told me someone else had come up with the same pager numberhow is that possible she apologized but cmon seating people isnt rocket scienceor is it apparently she wrote the wrong pager number next to my namei spoke to the manager about it and he seemed to somewhat care half heartedly but also implied i maybe had set my pager down somewhere and two dudes picked it up and took our place in linefirst of all how did i still have a pager when i walked up to the hostess stand secondly i dont know who would set a pager down somewhere and forget about it if theyre seriously waiting for a table i had my grandmother with me wanted to take her to a nice christmas eve breakfastthe pager never left my hands me setting my pager down somewhere makes no sense and hes bogus for believing the hostess who fed him that liei guess  girls working the hostess stand isnt enoughmaybe they need  girls up there to make sure the job gets done properly i ordered the french toast my grandmother had the eggs and bacon we enjoyed our food long story short the food was good our waitress was good but the service left something to be desired|bruce brown catered my wedding at the desert botanical garden  based on the other caterers that were in the running bruce brown was far and above in quality and taste of food  my guests raved that the catering was the best they had ever tasted at a wedding  i felt that for the price the menu was outstanding and of far greater quality than the price we paid  the only issue was with a matter of professionalism during one interaction which was quickly rectified when brought to attention  it would have been nice to not have to deal with any sort of frustrations to begin with  however everything was perfect the day of   all in all very delicious food that was superior for the price and a caterer that i highly recommend|hand car wash for  bucks you cant beat that thay do a ok job of

way|after i wrote my review i contacted as to give them one more chance to deliver the remote or else get a refund for it they had a unit coincidentally in stock and made an appointment to come out the next morning to install it it took about  minutes to complete and everything is in working order as also called later to followup and left a message to make sure i was satisfied for this reason im bumping up to  stars while overall were happy with the work quality and the employees are pretty friendly i just wish i hadnt had to chase them down over the last six months to get everything done|the bright lights and overhead led display make this a oneofakind experience it is totally free to walk through the experience and within the shortwalking distance there is from endtoend there is a lot to experience its totally worth having to pay for parking valet or going to the parking garage would be the most convenient choicesthere are  performing stages many stores and restaurants and countless street performers painting dancing impersonators posing for photos and everything in between i find it absolutely amazing to see the rich diversity in the performances shops and people at fremont that pack the walkwaysa great place to go at night for a walk not for people who are sensitiveaverse to cigarette smoke there are a lot of homeless people here so be wary|ch has some cool clothes love the whole silver metallic accessories that are on their stuff and some of the designs are pretty unique i would say their clothes are pretty high quality and a symbol of luxuryi see some celebrities wear

one issue with one of the female young employees  just felt like she was being put out when i asked a question and asked for her to look again be very aware the parking here is horrible  busy and hard to get in and out of  hopefully it will ease up after the holidays|i still like krispy kreme doughnuts on occasion and this is one of the few remaining stand alone stores in vegasi think this was actually the first krispy kreme store to have opened in vegas about yrs agoi remember how far away this location seemed at the timein any case got their doz deal a dozen regular and a dozen assortedhave a friend that loves their kreme filled one not the boston cream but their icing filled one added a few lemon filled sour cream and maple ones to fill the mixnice quick fresh doughnuts what more could you want for a morning treat|went here for the first time a couple of days ago  quickly seated and service was attentive even though they were very busy food was of good quality  pleasant decor my wife said it is an older persons place but there was  a variety of clientele i would like to go back here again  good flavor to the food|the meat was perfectprobably the best i have ever eaten the bun was tasteless but still did not ruin the whole experience comments on my end their house sauce was nothing to remember and their burgers dont come with frieswho should i tell it to

up to the window he is driving and we got two seperate orders he asks her in the window how are you and she responds ive been better trust me a normal response i would have said the same thing then

haha|honestly have no idea about the place never played there but i did order a gift certificate in the mail for my little brothers christmas gift so he could go play i never received the certificate in the mail but today christmas eve i got a text from pepe asking if i got it i had not contacted them they just asked me i said no and a few hours later he hand delivered it to my door im giving  stars because the original certificate never made it to my house when i ordered it  days ago but when it comes to costumer service i cant rate them high enough thank you pepe|good not great definitely some of the best beer you can sip on in the burgh worth a visit|we are adults  we want to leave the kids at home and go have an adult burger with an adult milkshake  you want burgervana  big daddys will do the trick just fine there are plenty of beer options and a full bar  if you have to bring the nonadults then there are menu items for the entire family  just go here and enjoy  dcor  out of food   out of drinks   out of service  out of cleanliness   out of |service wasnt great but the food more than made up for it great local ingredients and perfectly paired dishes huge portions as well definitely a go to for hangover breakfast|i gave a  star because my nails look nice but i would prefer a nail shop that takes their time and the front desk girl dont ask the lady who just started on my nails if she is done the lady filed my nails short and didnt even ask before she started too busy and too crowded thats a good thing but not when you are the one getting your nails done and the lady is rushing to get to the next person lady was in a happy cutting mood she cut too much skin she did a good job with my gel mani and also my color change but i am not returning back they didnt even remember i asked to get my eyebrows waxed and i set up an appt so i didnt even get my eye brows waxedjust wasnt the right place for me |my wife recently enrolled me in a monthly membership at this massage envy after being a member for over a year  it is definitely money well spent  the front desk staff is always friendly and helpful and most of the massage therapists are top notch  after long nights at work it is certainly a relief to get a massage of the neck shoulders and back|good food good service good atmosphere  stars only because i dont consider brios fine dining but never had a bad experience there good portions as well|really wanted to like this place the service was alright and the interior is very trendy  the sushi however was expensive and really mediocre there are many better options in phoenix for what they want you to spend here sorry sushi place|this is a pretty good representation for japanese food in america i had a tonkatsu meal with tempura and my wife had an american sushi roll and an inarizushi the tonkatsu was cooked well but would have preferred some fatter pork  i love marbling the tempura was light and not overly battered and oily which was done really well i think some of the vegetable tempura pieces were not cooked enough but the shrimp was perfect the miso soup was lacking and seemed to be the typical instant miso soup with barely anything in it i didnt try the americanized maki that my wife had but helped with the inarizushi which tasted good the service was above average but nothing special  drinks were refilled in a relatively timely manner and we were checked onoverall i scored this lower since i am kind of picky with japanese food having lived in japan and growing up with japanese food as well as going to japanese restaurants from japan guam hawaii california and other us metro areas but this is a place i would go to again and recommend to others|yum so we were having thai withdrawal because flagstaff restaurants have been out of their ingredients anyway this was a breath of fresh air  highly enjoyed the green curry  so good their noodles werent bad either they have the actual thai noodles that flag doesnt i hope we go back before leaving|i really enjoyed my burger at blt as did my dining partner the burger was cooked to perfection and the fries were amazing blt is definitely on my go back to when im in vegas again the staff was helpful and friendly as well as attentive without being over bearing|for what it is japanese fast food it is really good the rice was cooked perfectly  the salmon in my role was tender and not fishy my companion got the teriyaki beef bowl lol carb option which replaced rice with steamed veg however it was swimming in saucenot so low carbother than that  it was quite tasty the sushi options are fairly limited and no sea weed salad but price is definitely right if youre wanting a fast meal good price rather than a fine dining experience this is the place|same ol buffalo wild wings as anywhere else so nothing too amazingthe place is clean floors are clean and staff are friendly food came out quickly and our server was very attentive this place reminds me of kind of like an upscale bar food place as they sell pretzels nachos and lots of finger foods there are tvs all over the place  claw machines and another game machine all in all im sure ill be back again soon|friendly restaurant with excellent portuguese chicken the fries are to die for they are like potato chips and taste amazing the chicken is pretty good but maybe not as crispy on the outside as i like it lots of combos and excellent if you want to share with someone overall great place to eat and i would definitely good back|i and a party of six others dined at the reubens location just west of peel street on saint catherine on a tuesday evening the place was packed the waiter who served us was an exceptional polite and informative young man who knew the menu insideout my personal opinion was that this was the highlight of the dining experiencefor starters we ordered our beverages and i received a coca cola that was flat this was a harbinger of the meal to come which i would describe as fair to middling the meal that i chose from the menu was the famous super sandwich the meal included the classic reubens smoked meat sandwich of  ounces of smoked meat on rye bread with mustard  as well there was a coleslaw with dill pickle and french fries for the price of while the smoked meat sandwich was ok i did not appreciate the french fries these were nothing more than mccains frozen french fries the kind that one finds in mcdonalds restaurants i found that this cheapened the plate and would have preferred a different cut of fries overall the dining experience was ok finally the location of this establishment is reflected in their meal prices which seemed to be somewhat overpriced for this type of restaurant and meal|we love going here whether its saturday night or a busy weekday the restaurant is clean and goodsized it isnt a fancykind of place  we usually order two chicken platters which are two chicken sticks with dressed cucumbers potato fries and pita all of this always goes well with a cherry cola that we split the food comes quick and good and it is always the same it is a classic in our family and we enjoy coming here|a bit disappointed although they have a variety of poutine variations to choose from it did not taste spectacular nothing really special about it|weve been here twice and both times were to take advantage of the allyoucaneat sushi its a great deal but the key thing to remember is that you have to pay for anything you dont eatheres a ranking of our favorite rolls  mostly just for posterity  z roll sweet american fuji roll crazy dragon black pearl tiger roll|due to the fact southpark mall is pretty close to me i often dont go to northlake mall as it is a little bit of a drive northlake mall is average in my mind offering a lot more midrange stores where southpark has more highend stores  the one thing that is somewhat annoying about northlake is the parking  it is so spread out and very confusing that there are always backups trying to enter and exit the mall  the food court offers a great variety of lunch spots but can get crowded around lunch timeas for the stores although there are so many i felt like the employees at every store were rude or not very happy about working  yes i was there most recently around the holiday season but they just seemed annoyed  no one asked to help assist with anything  didnt enjoy thatoverall northlake mall does the job for getting your shopping done  an added bonusthe surrounding stores outside the mall all great  you can get to target best buy old navy and others and enjoy lunch or dinner away from the mall at many places pf changs fridays etc|wasnt so thrilled with the quality of food bread stale and food average hyped up because of the venetian|ive been here many times and i absolutely love the food the soup i always order makes me feel better and the spam musubi is amazing my only problem is the people some times they can be really nice and other times there a little rude but hey the food is great|we happen to be here on a warm october yes i said warm lol visiting our son and baby cousin in college  the surf shack in the middle of a desert will catch your eye immediately  i love all the memorabilia  the staff was awesome  very friendlyit was warm and sitting outside in the heat with not even a slight breeze made it a rough first time experience  i dont know if their fridge was down but we were served slightly cooled canned sodas out of a cooler and the salsa that came out of the little soda fridge on the counter was starting to turn it kept exploding out of the mustard squirter container  the food was on point  the tacos and burgers were good but we couldnt fully enjoy it because we were sitting there sweatingif you dont sitting outside in the heat youll get the most out of your two hippies experience if you visit in the phx winter which i plan on doing next week  all in all though good food chill atmosphere  id definitely go back  just not when its hot lol|the food amount of different drinks and service is pretty good i had a seared tuna steak which seemed to be a pretty good portion everything tasted pretty good i also had a spicy mango caipirinha which was only ok i think a normal caipirinha with lime would have been a better choice but the picture in the drink menu looked good the server was pretty attentive and refilled our water glasses several times and checked on us the food here is pretty pricey and the two of us getting meals and one drink a piece was around  this is probably one of the best restaurants in the westgate area but i still think it is a little too pricey|we came here for my birthday dinner and was really looking forward to it it was our first time and were so impressed on how beautiful the place is we were sat at  and ordered drinks which came out pretty quickly we ordered our entrees soon afterour first  courses came out prompt and the cauliflower soup was spectacular this is the main reason i am giving  stars after we finished our first  courses it was about  there were  tables around us getting their courses at about the same time both tables got their entrees about  minutes later we were still waiting the other  tables got their dessert and coffee we were still waiting both tables paid and left and we were still waiting finally our waiter came over and told they had a christmas party and the kitchen was backed up which we found questionable since we ordered at the same time as the other  tables who had already been gone  minutes we finally get our food around  the broccolini was cold the scallops were room temperature the chicken was luke warm really disappointing our drinks and scallops were comped but it didnt really make up for not warm food and mediocre service on my birthday if everything had been great we would have come back again now we wont|i walked into us egg the day after ironman arizona  oki hobbled in and then gingerly very gingerly sat downi instantly asked for a hot chocolate with extra whip cream and my waitress did not disappoint  i was given a tower of sugary goodness which i ate a lot faster than my run pacei ate some combination of eggs meat and potatoes  in my postrace fog i honestly dont remember what it was called but i know that a i liked it and b i wasnt hungry when i was done which is quite an accomplishment the day after racing  milesif i ever return to az i would definitely go again|i had heard good things about this restaurant i decided to give it a try at lunch and ordered the shrimp pad thai it was drenched in too much sauce tasted way too sweet had a strange smell and was not spicy enough i asked for  and it had  kick to it i will no longer go out of my way to the north side to eat thai food|nothing more than okay and prices werent too wallet friendly skip the breakfast buffet|much much much too expensive for what it was  we had the  course meal with wine pairing  service was good though very slowly paced   hour dinner  the total for the meal for   wine tasting for  others were kids was  including tip  of the courses  were not great  were quite good and  were outstanding  i recommend not getting the oystersalso parking is difficult and hard to findthis place could be so much more than it is  and for the price it should be|delicious food we had the beef kebab falafel sandwich chicken tagine and chicken bastilla one thing  if you want the chicken bastilla you must order it a day in advance this seemed odd to me but the way the owner explained it was that the phyllo dough had to be scratch made still it would have been nice to show that on the online menu|this is my to go to spot for sushi in las vegas ive been going here since new years of  the price hasnt changed mich for their ayce and theyre open late which is nice i also like how they have a time limit considering how they can get busy fast and some people like to gorge themselves on foodi always get their seaweed salad here and their salmon skin hand roll even if i order a la carte these will be my prime items they do offer half rolls which is amazing since some rolls are like  pieces long food comes out promptly and they do mention that some items will take longer on the menu i usually get nigiri here and i have been always satisfied they also have a large variety of rolls to choose from if youre into all that their service is borderline okay to good theyre prompt and they bus plates fairly quickly if you make them available but they dont really have much personality or a smiling factor but considering the type of people who go into these type of restauarants i shouldnt be surprised they end up not putting too much emphasis on that so be sure to tipanyway point being i come back for the food and prompt service thanks guys|my husband and i went for happy hour on christmas eve everything was great the drinks were delicious the shrimp and grits were great the catfish was lightly fried the calamari was fried a bit too hard the customer service was wonderful as well we will return|in the center of the sprawl its hard to find places with much of an identity but this one seems to be pretty unique i really liked the service and the food was probably in the  star range we got breakfast my only complaint is that its a casino and its not that unique to deserve

hole on the wall or mom and pop mexican restaurant|ive heard so much about firebirds and see locations all over charlotte nc cant say i was overly impressed with the fooddrink selection but the service was great and very friendly in northlake|having lived in se asia for  years i was very excited to try this place outwhen a place advertises as thai and vietanemese i am a bit skeptical it is akin to putting indian and chinese food together the menu felt like a mishmash of places and dishesi got a stir fry noodle dish it was good but the flavors seemed a little dulled down not the flavor explosion i would expect from a se asian placepositives still solid se asian food and seems like an accessible way to eat this food for some and it also looks nice from the outsideservings are a great dealsize|we had really good service the only two things i would say is the calamari is not good and one of my sides were cold the side was replaced immediately with no fuss would definitely eat there again|if youre into this japanese kawaii culture this is the only place i know of in pittsburgh that can help you get your fix  to find your way into this tiny basement shop look for the sign near a minisidewalkalleyway off walnut and step down into it  the first thing youll realize is that youve never ever seen so many hello kitty things in your life  then youll realize theres actually more around the corner  i had no idea what the rest of the licensing was and most of it was in japanese but evidently there are other similar fads to hello kitty with their own merchandise lines of odd cuteness that may or may not have a practical use  this is a pretty popular shop judging from the parade of shoppers filing through the cramped aisle fawning over this and that cute and odd item  the cashier was very polite and ready to assist anyone who needed help  an interesting place to wander|went back for a couple of times this last week and was very impressed by not only the food but the staff  much better wo our grandsonsbut they even enjoyed it despite their typical kid behaviorloved the healthy chicken hash w egg whites on the first trip hubby had the greek omelet that morning  it looked so good that i healthied it up by switching egg whites tomato slices and took out the cheesestill looked and tasted great|we found this convenient little starbucks on our way to tough mudder

bring as a giftthe interior of the shop is really inviting feminine and trendy the pastries and treats all look very professional what a great little shop definitely coming back to try a macaron ive never had one but theirs look wonderful|they microwaved their breadbowl chili   which results in inedible rubbery bread  other than that the chili was fine   note they dont have bud on draft despite the sign|excellent chinese food  only been about  times but have not been disappointed yet  we were disappointed in a few dishes we chose because were deep fried and neither had vegetables  we left feeling like we bathed in a vat of oil  otherwise the food has always been exceedingly good  my son and i are very sensitive to msg they say they dont add extra to the dishes  so far we have not gotten sick thank you for being here in the qc|they always do a great job when ive been in for pedicures rarely do i have to wait too long|historically a great job on dry cleaning and shirt launderinghowever a recent order was not found at the time i went to pick it up the cleaners i believe should have notified me that they were trashing my clothes due to an untimely pickup they have my contact information including phone number and email addressso please dont assume that you will be notified simply because dry clean city sends many emails and has your phone numberwilliam l kennedywmlekengmailcom|wowi have never had a better experience in my life  the food here was great the service was impeccable  and the price was reasonable  though the idea of cooking your own food was creative unlike other places i know it made me uneasy and cautious of the food disease ecoli besides that i have nothing else against your restaurant i am looking forward to coming here again|good fast food mexican i really like their rolled tacos burritos are good too i will pick this place over filibertos everyday|my review is based solely on the christmas light display they do such a wonderful job decorating the whole place top to bottom that it is amazing we went here on a date and it gives off such a loving atmosphere they have a few displays up of the manger scene and a couple of other religious displays they even put on a little play even though its not entirely accurate this place gets crowded towards school break so i would avoid it like the plague around that time theres tons of free parking even though it may take a few minutes to find some if you just love free lights and an enjoyable free evening this place is worth checking out as for the temple part of it i have no idea|doesnt scream opulentvegas like the wynn bellagio or venetian  we booked  bedroom suite  large nicely appointed but it reminded me of a w hotel or a newer westin  certainly not a uberluxurious star resort on the strip  theres a reason why this hotel is consistently rated below the major star places in vegas  they dont go the extra milegood  great location at the center of the strip  lots of stuff to do inside the building itself  beautiful showerbath area  the level of detail in the construction was quite impressive it looked like they had a great qc person during construction  balcony was nicebad  on the strip so sirens were frequently heard even near the top of the tower  kitchenette was laughable  cigarette smell  no extra blankets or details typical of a  star resort  cheap iron blow dryer etc  cigarette burns on the tables  battered walls  some light bulbs were out  it may seem like im nitpicking but what do you expect for the price and touting itself as a five star place  the trump hotel is nicer more  star like and they charge half the priceconcerning the kitchenette  cabinets were empty and the room had fewer glasses than any other marriott ive visited  fridge was a stocked minibar with sensors so dont think about putting your champagne in there or youll knock over the  bud lights and theyll be charged to the room why is there a microwave  if the fridge was usable a microwave would make sense  im sure when it was first opened they had kitchen items in the kitchenette but they probably cheaped out and took them away  the room also had a slight cigarette smell with some fragrance intended to mask it  upon arrival it smelled fine but then when we returned later in the night it was more prominentoverall as my first visit to the cosmo i would have rather stayed at the venetian or wynn  it would have been less expensive and they just feel nicer  disclaimer  marriott platinum member|stayed for the  year anniversary deal and received a second night for  dollars great deal but not available anymore we stayed at the terrace suite which was very pleasant the rooms are elegantly designed but still have the contemporary feel and the balcony view of the strip was definitely the best part the only downside was that we were stuck on the th floor of a  floor building guest services was excellent every time we requested towels room cleaning etc they arrived in no time they were also really nice and didnt sit around awkwardly expecting to receive tips though we did tip them the only time they messed up was when we left the room a bit messy and they didnt clean it up completely they probably assumed we didnt want our stuff moved around but still should have tidied up the place more the front desk staff was also pretty good had terrible issues with marquee nightclub and the resort manager tried to help the best she could but couldnt bc they are an outsourced company the casino could use a bit of work many dealers werent the most friendly and the floor staff wasnt so helpful when you try to ask for directions and what not note there is no poker roomthis would have been a no brainer  star review but the casino brings it down they delivered the way a high end hotel should otherwise|so ive been there just do join some people and we shared a pitcher nothing more the waiter was quick and really friendly the burger and the poutine of our fellows looked gread and they said its amazing and the beer was not bad at all we took the lager good atmosphere maybe ill try the food someday myself the other references are pretty bad which makes me think about not going again nothing special tho but not bad at all|usually we love this place but on this time we had to take an evening appointment for our boys we have always gone during the day before and the night staff is awful well at least the two we got were my youngest son got an older blonde woman and she had the worst attitude as i tried to explain what we had done to his hair last time there were no notes on him for some reason she was so rude another stylist tried to intervene but backed off before things got unprofessional this woman started the haircut clearly in a tiff and ended up cutting my two year olds ear at least she slowed down after that but sheesh we brought in a picture of what we wanted for my older son age  and specifically said we wanted it kept long on top it was already really grown outwe even provided a picture well he now looks like frankenstein half his darn forehead is showing at least this girl was sweet but i will never go back in the evening again ugh so disappointed ive included photos of the beforeafter and the example photo we showed herat least it will grow back right|what a great cut of steak got a moscow mule to accompany this and a selection of lobster appetizers|during my last visit here i came around the closing hour ish so i didnt expect a lot of people to be here or for the staff to even be enthusiastic i ordered the pepperoni pizzawich pepperoni mozzarella parmesan with caramelized onions mushrooms garlic salt and pepper on a toasted wheat bun it was pretty good and tasted like i expected the only downside to this dining experience was that i ordered a hot sandwich but the pepperoni was a little cold in the center despite this my experience here was still pretty good i will definitely come back again|my fiance and i visit this restaurant often we love the atmosphere and variety of the menu  lately ive been addicted to the grilled cheese sandwich with tomatoes and bacon it usually comes with tomato bisque which my man always gets but i prefer the rich creamy clam chowder  we went last sunday my sandwich couldve been more golden brown but the bacon was super crispy and the cheese very gooey so that made up for it  the clam chowder was very hot and generous with the clams  service was ok i finished a glass of water and put the empty glass where the waitress could see it but she passed it many times before i stopped her and asked for a refill  well definitely be back|we always go to this place when we are planning on a chinese buffetit has the biggest selection  and sushialthough they have the typical chinese buffet desserts you can scoop your own ice cream here my kids love thatmy husband always gets something cooked on the hibachi grilli love their coconut chickenthe people are very nice dont forget to check out the fish and turtles up front|best late night happy hour in las vegas   captin jamesonlike bonkers awesome prices   ask for alex or annamaria |this restaurant has much improved since we went last year we were early sunday morning regulars but the place started lacking so we lost interest theres more staff the current people today were happy and attentive theres an updated menu in an easy to read fashion they still have their  pancakes and  egg challenge theyve updated the interior decor which is rustic and cool theres more seating outside to accompany the long lines with a hostess stand the hot chocolate was piled high with whipped cream cinnamon and cho sauce and i regretted not ordering one i did try the marinated beef tips which were marinated for hours in unicorn tears lol literally the tips were too overdone for me but my husband loved the dish it came with a biscuit and gravy which was fantastic i would add some sausage chunks to this though we also got the chicken and waffles and that was tender and perfect the orange juice has a lot of pulp just the way i like it i think we would become regulars again based on todays experience|we had dinner here for the first time last night we had a party of five and made reservations for christmas family dinner when we arrived they sat at a table in the middle of the restaurant one member of our party actually had to sit in the aisle way as we sat down i noticed they sat at a table of five who just walked in off the street at a nice cozy corner table for  this did alter my view of the restaurant for i wanted a nice christmas dinner for my family with good food and good conversationour waitress approached the table she seemed very nice and had a desire to service as well  unfortunately she did not seem to have adequate training to achieve this goal she try hard throughout the night to services but nothing seems to go right example we asked her about bread she said well sometimes the kitchen has it and sometimes it doesnt it just happens that way i thought this was an unacceptable answer they could have sent someone to the walmart just  mile away bought bread heated it up and served it it would have benn better than no breadonce ordering dinner it was served in a timely manner however our poor waitress continued to reach over diners to place plates in front of other diner at  this point i really started feeling sorry for her shes stranded on an island on her own trying to do a good job but not sure howwe thought the quality of the meals meet the price all the steaks came out cook as requested and there were no major concerns over any of the mealoverall it appears to me that this restaurant wants to compete with the upper end steakhouses the quality of their food achieve this goal  for which i give them two stars the quality of their servers only receive one star because even though they try hard they do not seem to have the tools to succeed i give management  stars because i feel they have been delinquent in training their staff throughout the two and a half hours we spent there for dinner i constantly scan the restaurant to see who was in charge i could not find anyone who seem to know what was going on in the entire restaurant no one address our table ask if the meal was good or if the food wad prepared properly i felt at a restaurant like this this was a huge faux pasas we left the restaurant two very nice employees wish us a happy holidays which i thought was great unfortunately they were standing right outside the exit on their smoke breaks which really makes me question management at this locationi wish this steakhouse the best of luck however i will not be returning with my family|the baked products are great and i would have a five star review based on quality however this morning i went in to get my wife a birthday cake their tiramasu cake is heavenly and thats what i was buying when i asked them to put a happy birthday message on the cake the clerk told me that they were too busy today to do that that is horrible customer service and i wrote this yelp review to make sure the owners understand that it is unacceptable customer service i have therefore lowered the rating to three stars because of the this lapse|the food was yummy but the place was kind of dirty the floor wasnt broomed so there were pieces of food all over for that i give  stars nothing wrong with the food though|well needed to get a quick bite and some coffee for the drive to cathis location is pretty convenient right near the  so easy to drive thru and get an order for the roadi know its only mcdonaldss but hey quick and cheap is good sometimesplus i had to make sure to get my annual mcribglad they only sell once in awhile because that way you wont get sick of this sweet gooey bbq reformed pork riblet  i still say yumgot a mcrib evm bought the extra mcrib for a buck and got large coffeethere was a bit of a line in the drive thru lanes but still ordered and done in  mins then onto the freeway to ca|this was the second time i have taken my siberian husky booboo in to be groomed the first time he looked great but wasnt quite as white in the face as normal and he was still damp at the base of his fur i called and let them know and they were very accommodating i took back in again and this is how he came out super soft fluffy and smelling wonderful his breath is better too  he was still slightly damp but nothing like the first time i know he has a ton of fur but i had taken him to another groomer for years who had him completely dry every time so i expect to get that i still very much recommend this place they are incredibly nice and do a great job|im not one to drink my noodle soup but how can you resist especially on a cold and windy night get the  and after drinking the soup youll have a nice and warm feeling in the pit of your stomach|excellent tapas place the paella is very tasty it would be perfect if there were more rice in the mix  food is in general too salty|yummy pizza that will satisfy you after a night of clubbing drinking or if youre looking for a snack this is located upstairs in the cosmo on the right side of where youd enter for their clubpool parties there isnt a name but instead a long hall with pictures that you walk down in luckily every time ive come here there wasnt a line you pick your slice they warm it up and you pay easy concept and quick bit to eat will run you about  depending on what kind of slice you get good crunchy texture but a bit oily guess thats what your napkin is for|pizza was decent not exactly mind blowing but a good snack if youre drunkthe success of secret pizza is its mystery factor  a neat idea  but the average pizza means this is just a one time visit for me|glutensensitives wingharts now has glutenfree buns  and theyre yummy ones  hooray  the food is really good and the menu very creative  its a little heavy  youll be dragging if you eat lunch here on a work day  and although i know everyones taste is different i do think they are a bit heavy on the salt  the menu is quite pricey but you pay for good fresh ingredients i suppose  the result  i rarely eat here but i always enjoy it  this visit i had the shipwreck burger  the meat was tender fresh and cooked perfectly with arugula brie cheese also melted perfectly white truffle aioli caramelized onions and bacon  i dont do burgers often but when i do i do it in style  lol  fyi i have heard complaints from others about the music volume being way too intense here|decent food although a bit hyped up and extremely meager portions good draft beer selection guinness competent friendly service and lots of outdoor seating id come back but only for a pint or two then id head a few miles south for some delicious thai food good times in aj|decided to check this place out due to the other good reviews on yelp and glad i did reviews are factual and coffee is worth making a visit|i had a good dining experience at wine  cafe i entered the restaurant during a weekday around lunchtime i was very impressed by the decor the flower arrangements statues and colors were something i had never seen before but it was nothing overwhelmingi was seated quickly in an empty dining room i believe i asked the waiter what was good or popular on the menu she suggested one of the heartier burgers and a side of vegetable logs i agreed to order what she suggested the burger came with a good time frame it was a very juicy burger but was not anything i thought was particularly special the vegetable logs which were various vegetables battered and fried were pretty tasty but a bit oilythis was the first time i was served african style food it left me with an impression of satisfaction i did leave with a full belly there is a vast menu ranging from tacos to seafood entrees i guess i have only scratched the tip of the iceberg when it comes to nairobi cuisine stop by to wine  cafe for a taste of africa|i went here around halloween pros i thought that the inside was really well done many of the rooms were cool our favorites were probably the airbag hallway and the spinning room the actors and actresses were playing up their characters and seemed to be having a great time cons it just wasnt scary there was just two of us and they grouped us with many other people it does say on the website that they may do this on busy nights the people at the front of the group may have been scared a couple of times in the beginning but we quickly caught up to the group in front of us and the group behind us caught up to us as well so we just had a long train of people walking through would have been much scarier if there was some anticipation of what was coming next or fear of something sneaking up from behind|found good fellas by searching for lentil soup in phoenix so i stopped by to try it ordered the gyro sandwich and falafel plate we loved all of it and will be back soon as for customer service it was excellent they made me feel like they were glad i was there and even offered me a complimentary bowl of potato soup which was excellent|its almost comical how often ive eaten their food without actually making a visit now that i have its time to reviewmy friend and i were going to try another greek restaurant closer to my place but they had already closed on christmas eve luckily we had a plan b that was still open yelp and las vegas weekly best of las vegas darling the great greekits tougher than expected to reach it because whoever designed the plaza inexplicably didnt add enough entrances or even paths even though you can see the restaurant from warm springs youll have to make several turns to arrive at the parking area its welcoming enough once you finally enter with indoor seating for around  and a tv with espnews in hdthe great greek gyro  with a beef and lamb mixture or chicken if you really truly must is a solid lunch option in addition to the tomatoes red onions and tzatziki of the traditional gyro  this pita comes with lettuce and feta i had experienced this in an assembleityourself form many times with trays ordered for group events and while it was certainly fresher and warmer at the restaurant it still didnt truly tantalize my taste budsthat said its at least on par with if not better than any other recent gyro that ive experienced and its really cool that they cut it in advance per request so that i could share it with a friendi also split one of the traditional plate menu items the grilled garlic shrimp  has two skewers of four marinated shrimp a piece the shrimp was cooked properly and had that juicy bite to it i cant say that the stated garlic and oregano were particularly prominent flavors but i liked squeezing the lemon wedge for acidity the pita was good the tzatziki was fine but the friesspecifically the feta fries which i think was a slight upcharge maybe ill backcalculate from credit card records from the regular fries but it was worth it for the rich feta and its creamier partner in crime sure the fries alone are the fairly thick floured kind that i enjoy the most but do the feta fries if you canthere was also a small salad included in the plate with a simple vinaigrette not really contributing as much as that everpresent feta its cool though i mean what are you doing here anyway if you dont like fetaill probably be back but not in a huge hurry or anything my first visit bore out my past perceptions that the food is really solid but not the beall and endall of greek cuisine|i had really high hopes for this restaurant we made reservations for xmas eve dinner i was happy they were serving lobster bisque which they usually only serve on saturdays apparently it was pretty good fresh bread was very good the menu had several great items on it since its a steak house i went with the filet they clearly state on the menu how to order the steak you want i ordered medium rare however it came charred on the outside and medium well done on inside my husbands  special was not s worth of special i really was hoping this was a great steak place|i like this place its always convenient to grab a quick meal that will fill me up the portions are smaller than what they used to be but still a great place|food is good here and the portions are great sized service is quick and responsive to the little egg notifier things on the table tables are a bit small but they get the job done for how busy they can get servers are a bit touch and go and perhaps need to know the difference between a screwdriver and a greyhound as long as its vodka i dont care lolid come back thats for sure they are really nice people after all thanks guys|this is really spot to eat sushi the food and the price is very well price special  sashimi  tempura  rice  soup  salad for  is excellent the quality of the fish is pretty good too customer service is not as good as sushimon in the southeast but special deal and value for the buck is good decoration is not good kinda cheesy mexican style orange wall and well decoration and position nothing neutral color and arrangement like other japanese sushi places i bet its a mexican interior decorator that did it mexican  japanese infusion|came here on wednesday afternoon  wait time was around    minutes   ordered special sora ramen and spicy ramen  food was relatively decent  for some reason my special sora ramen was a little salty compared to what i am used to   servers were super nice and helpful   crowd there is mainly young people and atmosphere was casual   parking is limited so maybe look for street parking  price is around  per bowl   not a bad place to check out if craving for ramen when visiting las vegas  pretty good choice for lunch on a cold day|i never really realized how fresh their fish is here until i been to other places in town this place is very nice and clean and service is great staff is very friendly and attentive they do have small rolls compared to a lot of places but the fish is very very fresh and thats what matters the most|sort of reminds me of a foodlesslarge no frills grocery storewas up in the area and thanks to a yelp friends tip shout out to carla m stopped off for gummie bears only lbthey actually had quite a few barrels of bulk candy items so ended up with about lbs of crapthat and a monster energy drink and i was outta there for less than  buck wowwill probably regret getting so much candy should probably lie to everyone and tell you its for the kiddies but nope all mine haha my dentist loves me|contrary to many we came here for brunch place was mostly empty with curt and polite hostesses who took care of us i went with the rockabagel and hot chocolate with whipped cream of course the hot chocolate was delicious without being too sweet perhaps i was famished but i really enjoyed my rockabagel it was chewy and tender and packed with tasty calories my only disappointment with the rockabagel plate coming with no accessories it was a yummy but nonetheless a pretty expensive bagel experience why not add a few potato wedges or a large fruit saladoverall a nice experience|my friend loves this store i think its an ok store with ok designs seems like an higher end hm with a slight twist to their designs their shoe section was pretty cool but my friend is really into fashion and totally recommends this store|i cannot speak to staceys ability as a massage therapist but i do not recommend booking via the yelp app as it appears the appointment availability times are not up to date i successfully booked a massage and then had it canceled as stacey was double booked the cancelation notice successfully arrived in email|this walgreens is super big its like the size of a small department store or something you can come here for all of your medicine and basic food needs they have an extensive selection of ready to eat foods like fruits and sandwichesthe prices here are a little high but for the convenience its probably worth it this location is also open |a cute little pastry shop for a cute little night out its not a big place its quite small actually but the treats are good try it out and sit outside on the tables i got their ice cream it was good|lets get this right off the bat rehab serves up one of the best burgers in az the leanfat ratio seasoning and cook on the burger patty is always on fleek your ability to choose what delicious bun is unique burger toppings are high quality and unrivaled on this particular visit i ordered the pbj bacon burger and was a bit surprised how well the flavors blended together i also had a bite of my dining partners hangover burger which was also delightful that being said their sides are awful french fries  so over cooked and bad that i almost broke my sobriety sweet potato tots  so soggy and bland that no treatment could help them onion rings  enough grease to fill a few shot glassesthe service was awesome and not your typical scottsdale vibe expect a  star burger and service but stay away from the other menu items|incredibly generous portions and cheap cheap service is great food is good huge menu a taste for everyone really good table dhote pricing i will come again and again and my wallet wont break|i love togos and nothing beats their  pastrami sandwich but i have to admit that service hasnt been that great lately the last three times ive visited togos have all been consecutively bad in their own way the last two times i placed my order online i arrived to pick it up and they just look at me dumbfounded and then say they didnt see the order so its completely pointless for me to preorder the second to last time i walked in and the store was empty but they were playing really loud uncensored hip hop music now im in my s so its not like im appalled by the songs but its just completely unprofessional my last visit was last night and ill take the blame for this one because i was unaware that they closed at pm and we showed up at  the chairs were already put on top of the tables and the employee saw my pull up and already had that look of dread on her face i get it but this is the only place where i can get the best pastrami sandwich she was overall friendly but sort of passiveaggressive right away i asked for two large pastrami sandwiches and she says were closing in  minutes so its going to be a long wait because we dont have anything hot i said its ok i dont mind the wait she rolled her eyes and slammed through the kitchen door as she was making the sandwiches she told me that i shouldve placed the order online so that they would have known that they would have to make pastrami i explained that the last two times i did that they forgot my order and she apologized for that while i was waiting i noticed a sign that had the weight of what a pastrami sandwich should be i wondered if those measurements were exact so when it came time for her to weigh the sandwich i took a peak it looks like we got shorted by a lot the sign said a large pastrami should weigh oz but ours were around oz like i said i get that they were closing soon but if youre already doing the job is it that hard to just do it right|great food pleasant sporting atmosphere waitstaff was creative in how they helped their guests had the wings street tacos very good it was busy but not packed so you could find a seat if you needed no smoking areas detected|just saw the revamped zarkana what an improvement i saw they original and thought that it was ok this version is much better the duet strap act is amazing the clowns are hilarious do yourself a favor and go see this show before it closes in april |the restaurant is near the kongfu tea if you go at the dinner time it may take you some time to wait but it worths it you can choose how spicy you want for the curry i have chose  and its kind of spicy|i just did a last minute shopping for christmas items for my neighborbought some cookies for christmas they over charged me by instead for one box chololate fingers they charged me for two boxesi found out when i arrived at homethey dis not have phone number i can callwill visit them when they open again |excellent quality variety and service  the multiple chefs and waiters kept the delicious sushi coming almost as fast as i could eat it  brown rice is a great option here  highly recommended i cant wait to go back|this was really good no complaints|this place is really great i and one of the few place that wont break ur bank account in the airport i love coffee but now i can only drink decafe which has really suck in until i found this place i have a feeling this wil be my coffee shop every time i go to phoenix thanx guys for making a great cup of coffee and come to la and charleston sc|clean room  really comfortable bed they had all the basic amenities a little bit of a drive to downtown but it was in a convenient location for our road trip|to start i will say zoolights gets only   stars for getting families together spending the time walking and talking with family was greatzoolights it self is very small has no close parking parking is almost a mile walk in itself and is not what i call affordable to the average family   a person children included is not reasonable for what you getor should i say what you dont get  i dont think they limit the number of people in the zoo cause most of the time it was impossible to move around|foods always good of course but theres a young lady here thats got to be the rudest person great service and good food as always but stay away from a brunette young lady with the attitude  youll be able to tell right away who im talking about trust me|there is no doubt about the burgers there the food is brilliant but too many people|great little holeinthe wall bagel shop nice chewy new york style bagels a few tasty sandwich options i had the baja bagel which featured egg cheddar cheese avocado and jalapeo cream cheese just a little heat very niceseating is a few outdoor tables which was nice in december arizona weather i imagine they would be less desirable in the summer heat|tldrrecommended though maybe without the full throated cheering from some of our fellow yelperswe stopped by while working out way down the strip due to the high praise from fellow yelpers on christmas eve they werent offering their usual less expensive lunch menu but hats off to the hardworking crew for working over the holidays its a mile or so east of planet hollywood so plan to drive or lyft over unless you need the exercisethe restaurant was basically full at  in the afternoon which we took as a good omen the banchan free appetizers came out even before we ordered and included a macaroni salad alongside the more typical kim chi pickled spiced cucumbers bean sprout salad pickled radish and fish cake the bean sprouts could have used a touch more seasoning but were otherwise finethe meats were well seasoned so much so that we didnt much miss the traditional dipping sauces we ordered a bibimbop that came in the traditional stone bowl but was not hot enough rice to crisp the rice the bulgogi that came with the bibimbop was excellent but the only other sides were hints of red peppers and onions order only as a side to accompany your bbq and not as a mealthe grill and exhaust hood were carefully maintained gleaming metal shiny clean bathrooms were clean as wellservice is typical for asian restaurants workmanlike but not particularly friendly a bit slow but chalk that up to the steady stream of dinersthe kids gave it a  so we will round up from  or disclosure we were offered a free dessert for this review ice cream macaroons were delicious|definitely some of the best coffee in the burgh that said the barista could have been a bit friendlier he probably wasnt a pittsburgh native so we will cut him a break worth a visit though|this is a great ymca with a positive environment i am only making this review because i dont want them to slack on their customer service i brought my son swimming here for the first time because he does not know how to swim there was a male lifeguard in place who was very vigilant of everyone in the pool he then switched out with a female she was doing a great job until a customer came in and started distracting her by holding what appears to be juicy unnecessary girl talk i watched as the lifeguard kept trying to hold the conversation looking eye to eye with the person and many times away from my son without exaggeration this conversation went on for about  minutes while my son was swimming i think i am being nice because it seemed longer i then broke my silence and yelled across the pool and said  to the lifeguard helloooothat is a gossip sessionthis here pointing to the pool is a life and death situationthe positive i give this lifeguard a  credit for getting out of bed on a christmas eve going to work to do that job you have to have a big heart to be a lifeguard i also thank her for not getting an attitude she seemed like she understood where i was coming from furthermore i sensed that the person she was chatting with was someone she knew and did not want to hurt their feelings it seemed she just couldnt bring herself to say hey no offense but can we chat laterto the lifeguard from me to you let nothing and no one distract you have the guts to tell those who want to chit chat i cant chat right now i am performing my lifeguard duties sincerely kim cmasters of science occupational safety and health|i have been going to sundance for well over  years  dr tom peters and heather harris are the two professional that take care of me and my husband  they are wonderful and have always taken the time to give me the help i am there for  both roberto and crystal their assistants are amazing  the front office staff has always been pleasant and accommodating  i have recommended them to many new patients|cest vrai que la premire fois je lai trouv un peu trop simple ton burger genre a fait laffaire sans plus puis finalement parmi la varit des places qui proposent des burgers en tout genre  montral jen viens  aimer ta simplicit je ne passe pas mins devant ta carte  me dcider tout se fait rapidement du service  la dgustation car disonsle il est bon ton burger mme fameux alors il ne reste pas longtemps dans mon plateau ni mme tes frites|dog friendly that would be enough for a five star rating the patio is cozy dog friendly with tvs to watch the game there is always some sort of drink specials as well simon was my server and he was very friendly and attentive also brought my pup bacon the food is very good very similar to postinos overall enjoyable place to hangout|very disappointed been coming in for a few months on and off heard about a great cook he was very good the food was amazing and i ask to talk to him he was very polite and friendly went in the other night and found out they fired the cook very disappointed|this place is usually very crowded the staff seems to work very hard to be quick and efficient though ive tried the lentil curry coconut soup which was lovely full of flavor with just the right amount of spice and sweetness also have tried the breakfast burrito and yogurt and granola parfait both very tasty just too much food to consume at once this is a cute caf with a nice patio for when its not too hot|wahoos is a fast casual chain serving bowls burritos tacos and enchiladas melding mexican brazilian and asian flavors ill usually get their fish their tacos which theyre known for and they usually dont disappoint ive had no complaints with service with any of my visitsthe view separates this location from others as you can see both the summit of black mountain and you can can also have an unobstructed view of the entire valley if you choose to sit at the bar or out on the patio weather permitting the dining area is spacious with plenty of tables and some booths against the wallwhen you order you have the choice of protein for your dish which includes chicken carnitas carne asada fish shrimp and tofu the food is ok to me and on par with most taquerias and teriyaki bowl places with their fish tacos being worth return trips for everything else is a notch pricier to other establishments but not significantly elevated in flavor on this particular visit i had the carne asada outer reef burrito cheese lettuce rice beans green sauce with a side of salsa the steak was flavorful but i could have done without the lettuceif im in the vicinity id come back for some fish tacos or maybe to chill out in the bar or out on the patio with cerveza in hand|damn good tacos that really hit the spot the al pastor meat was perfection all the veggie toppings and hot sauces were so fresh only complaint is that the flour tortilla was a bit on the dry sidecame here on xmas eve and the staff was super friendly with their cute santa hats|heard a lot about the french toast but missed the breakfast cutoff had half rack and ny strip the ribs were dry and the ny strip was served with bbq sauce for some reason not the best place to eat but since the steak was perfectly cooked lets call my sub par experience a blip rather than the standard im going to try that french toast if it kills me|cest si bon french grocery offers various louisiana style and more traditional french dishes we came here for lunch and had a roast beef au jus sandwich pomme frites iced cafe au lait and a croque madame the layout is chic and uncluttered with various tables a cold fridge section numerous varieties of wine for purchase a dessert case and a cheese case the food came out in a short time and smelled heavenly the croque madame was perfectly crisp with a lovely mix of flavors from the ham and cheese the runny egg on top was perfect it was so filling i could only finish half of a sandwich the roast beef in the sandwich was tender and flavorful the pomme frites were more thinly cut but had an airy crispness and were perfectly seasoned the cafe au lait was smooth and i loved the hint of chicory in the coffee this version tasted a little lighter than others ive had though at this time the menu seems more skewed towards traditional french dishes than louisiana style cuisine for instance the dinner special for today was a rabbit cassoulet and the only louisiana type foods i could see for today for lunch were the beignets and chicory coffeeat the condiment and utensil counter there is honey agave nectar and sweeteners at the table include sugar in the raw and steviaif i didnt already have enough desserts at home for a small army i would have taken home some of the goodies in the dessert case there were various flavors of macaron stout gingerbread fruit tart and eggnog cheesecake when i browsed ill definitely come here again for more delectable edibles and will have to try their beignets|i am very mixed on this place it has such potential but in the end the service is why i give it three stars i have been twice for lunch and the experience has been the same both times it smells wonderful inside from all kinds of pastries and baked goods my first visit i had the shrimp po boy a baguette stuffed with barbecue shrimp served warm not the traditional new orleans way cold with lettuce and mayo it was very good i had iced tea to drink after asking for an arnold palmer they can make an arnold palmer with a lemonade you can buy from their drink case however this day the drink case was wiped out of just about everything non alcoholic this visit i had the cochon melt a warm baguette sandwich stuffed with sliced pork cheese slaw and picked scallions again a very good sandwich i also ordered the french onion soup as did the rest of my party to drink i ordered the french press coffee for one after going to the drink case and seeing that it was again pretty wiped out of non alcoholic beverages i was very happy with the coffee though excellent flavor we took a seat and waited for our order two of my friends received their soup right away but not me i thought to myself maybe she didnt hear me order it so ill wait it out and see if it comes well it came out with the rest of the food i cant stand when something i order to be eaten first comes with my entree my friends were already done with their soup as for the soup itself good but french onion should have soft bread and melted cheese on top this soup was hot but the bread was so hard i couldnt cut into it and the slice of cheese was just laying on top not melted the sandwich made up for it though as i said it was very good back to the real reason for the three stars service some of the staff just dont seem to too interested in being there they dont seem very helpful and have zero personality its almost like they are doing me a favor by serving me no i am doing you a favor by paying you for good service since you pre pay for your food at lunch time you also pre tip next time i will hold off on the tip until the end to see if i will still get  good service the was a very nice woman who was working in the wine section i wish she had been taking care of us another thing french grocery i dont think its hard to keep your non alcoholic drink case stocked i am no stranger to cocktails and wine and would love nothing more than to get loaded at lunch time but unfortunately my boss does mind you are most likely going to sell more non alcoholic drinks at lunch on weekdays|the food is always fantastic and consistent here the service can be hit or miss depending on the server and whether or not the restaurant is busy my friends and i come here about every other week it gets very loud and crowded on game days so be prepared my boyfriend always gets the buffalo chicken sandwich i highly recommend their chicken quesadilla fish tacos or pub burger|spent last week at the golden nugget and craved something other than hotel food i found pizza rock just three blocks away  you can order by the slice when you walk in the front door or choose to be seated i decided to sit at the bar and peruse the menu  the menu was overwhelming so after a good fifteen minutes i decided to go up front and get a slice it was delicious  it was so good that i returned the next night with my wife and ordered a different pizza i will give pizza rock  stars easily eric the man behind the bar was professional and helpful i will return to pizza rock to try their pasta  the next time i am in vegas and give them a shot at that th star|i called ahead the same day to make sure they would be open when i got out of work christmas eve  i was assured they would be open until  but i arrived at  pm to find them closed i really needed this since the kit i ordered forgot batteries it is totally going to ruin my christmas and has really turned me off from coming back to a place that either doesnt know their own holiday hours or doesnt care enough to stay until the time that they knew a customer was coming inedit  my boyfriend talked me into giving them another shot and i definitely dont regret it  they know their stuff and have helped us a lot  and even apologized to him  they even let us exchange a bottle when it was a little too strong for him|theres a new portuguese sheriff in town full respect to a certain other portuguese rotisserie down on the west end of rachel but ma poule has their game on tight smoky charred chicken glorious potatoes tasty fries sweetsweet nata by no means have the super friendly team here reinvented the wheel theyve just finetuned it pumped it full of air and put some nice new rims on it didnt try their poutine or anything more elaborate just stuck with the basics which as it turns out were anything but my new portuguese chicken jam|busy during lunch service and food is ok nothing special waiters talk too much and they dont care or have the fairmont sense of service typical hotel food food came in cold its good if you want something casual compared to the other restaurants in the area i wouldnt recommend it ambience is soso|first impression outstanding  although i have had one dining experience here i can say unequivocally i will be back a welcome change to the many ho hum bacon and egg restaurants that are common place in mesa staff were friendly and attentive|cool vintage clothing store in the plateau with some very interesting items that are more edgy think the uk store all saints mixed in with some rockabilly hipster items plus motorcycle wear although not harley yet very street savvy very interesting to peruse the boutique as the do carry brands and many old nostalgia and vintage wear yet in a modern setting which is clean and well merchandised i didnt grab anything on my visit but i want to come back as there are many cool pieces to spice up that wardrobe or add some flair to that closet of yours|had the chicken shawarma plateton of food shawarma had a lovely cardamom flavor and was cooked perfectly the rice and humus had a nice balance that perfectly complimented the shawarma  excellent customer service nice atmosphere and a really clean quaint restroom which one really appreciates after  hours on the road|good for with a decent offering for happy hour  the boneless wings are tasty and the burgers are large enough to share|great breakfast and super nice staff at a reasonable price my go to breakfast joint now what i did there do you see it|i never knew meatballs could be so varied and tasty the waitress was friendly  provided us great service nice view from the top floor|my friend and i visited buddyz for the first time and i was pleasantly surprised how very scrumptious the pizza was  we had the water tower place butter crust cheese  pepperoni  it was worth the trip  looking forward to returning|all of the food was great but they could really make some improvements when it comes to their service i went there last night for dinner with my friends host was nice and greeted us at the door it was a about a  minute wait before we got sat the bar was completely empty around  pm when i asked her if we could just sit at the bar since we were all doing ayce she told us that the entire bar area was reserved for a big party that party didnt even show up until a little past  on the floor there were three waitresses tending to all the tables at once after one of them came to greet us and take our drink orders another one came right after being a waitress myself i know that most restaurants have their waitresses divide up their tables into sections one of the first things i ordered was the soft shell crab tempura after about  mins i asked our waitress if the kitchen had possibly forgotten my order and she said it takes longer to make and that it would be ready soon ok understandable but after another  mins it still had not come out yet when i asked another waitress who took our order she said that she would check on it it didnt come out until we were pretty much full and about ready to order dessert so i know they definitely forgot to ring it in also it took forever to get refills on our waters and after our waitress came to take our sushi orders again she only took mine then left immediately after  without even looking at my other friends and asking if they wanted anything else overall food was great like i said but they really need to step up their game on service especially on a semibusy night like last night maybe three waitresses on the floor isnt quite enough|the french toast hollandaise duo was so so goodotherwise it feels like a place that parents take their college kids out to eat ok but im not in college and dont have a kid in college or a kid at all  this can mean parking is hard and the wait can be long  cocktails were fun and tasty but a bit small|i came to cafe moulin on a couple of different occasions but mostly for brunch while there is usually a wait i have never experienced a wait longer than  min now most of the brunch places do not take reservations and cafe moulin is no different i have had a couple of their savory and sweet crepes coffee and also their french toast all that i have had so far was fresh light and very delicious but specifically the french toast was definitely my favorite i also much prefer cafe moulins crepes over crepe parisienne in oakland much better quality fresher ingredients and nicer atmosphere i find the staff very friendly and approachable last time we were  people and in order to get in quicker we were sitting at the bar right next to the kitchen it was a bit uncomfortable for  people but that was our fault as we asked to sit there so as soon as we spotted a table becoming available we asked the owner if it would be possible to switch and it was absolutely no problem at all every time i am here i feel welcomed and the food is amazing what more can you ask for|the inside is really relaxing and there are enough pedicure chairs for about ten people at a time the workers are really professional and the nails with design turned out great also did a good job with eye brow waxing only four stars because of the price it is very expensive four dollars extra for longer lasting nail polishnot even gel is a bit ridiculous to me|we ordered elvis waffle without any meat bananatella a regular coffee and a caramelmacchiato waffles were good not great  not super sweet but just right the coffee was not great but their caramel macchiato was delicious|first time here the hallways heading into the room kind of has this dark spooky image to it the interior of the hall way was painted in black and white the room itself we got a king size bed white interior lots of mirrors the mirrors light up as well very feminine room i personally liked it was kind of cute and simple|i love the henry i have been here multiple times for lunch and dinner and im never disappointed the most recent time we ordered the popovers which is essentially this very light and airy biscuit it comes with two butters one of which was ham butter dont knock it till you try it guys because it is absolutely delicious for entrees i ordered the branzino my absolute favorite type of fish and it was so good comes with a side of vegetables everything seasoned and cooked to perfection i highly recommend it my boyfriend ordered the short ribs which were delicious as well forget the knife you wont need it it is that tenderwe decided to opt out of dessert but trust me we were very tempted the only downfall i would say are the portion sizes for me they are large enough to be content but my boyfriend was still hungry by the time we leftthe decor is beautiful there is a patio that is fully heated which is where we sat since there was no wait it was so pleasant perfect temp and lighting indoor seating is also a great choice there is a bar and even a coffee shop on the side if that is your fancy love this place i highly recommend it|interesting atmosphere  i went here mainlybecause i heard the atmosphere was really cool  i think its kind of overrated in that respect  they had a band play about  minutes after we got there and thats it  the food is super pretentious super expensive and super small portions  it is however tasty  they dont even give you bread you have to buy it as an appetizer and they charged me a  fee for water when i asked for tap water  not my scene i guess but nothing bad to say about the food itself|i had heard of this truck but never tried it another truck was parked near and i was heading that way but my wife convinced me to trust her and try this one she ordered the white truffle burger knowing my tastes shes a smart woman it was an excellent burger the only thing was the bun couldve been a little warmer seriously  the only downside was the bun not warm enough its a great burger|the taste of the meals we ordered we very similar they all had this sesame flavour though the beef and the topokki were amazing|really cute place i had a green tea latte with cheesy garlic toast and it came out to about  not too bad for a good size piece of toast and tea beware not all of the lattes are artsy and beautiful but they do taste very good|we were delighted to join friends last night for a first anniversary soiree at this venue

white i recommend the  oz haha the service was most excellent awesome people that really take care of you dont forget to tip the steam pot cooks at the bar|not bad i was in town and was craving a smoothie and found this place on yelp they have juices smoothies acaipitaya bowls it was filled with high schoolish aged people when i was there which is refreshing to see young people choosing to eat healthythere is a spa in the back no bathrooms |the food was great i highly recommend the chicken pot pie  i would have given a  full stars but it was very poor service  granted it was christmas eve but when we arrived at  it wasnt that busy and not once did our waitress paula come back to refill my drink or see if we needed anything else|this hotel was selected for me as part of a promotion  my stay was free  the location is in north phoenix so depending on what you are doing on phx this might be out of the way or a long drive to wherever you desire to go  the area surrounding it was very commercial with chain restaurants and stores all around  theres not much to do if youre looking for local nonchain places etc  we had to drive pretty far to get to the good stuff this hotel serves it purpose with no extra fluff  you get the basics and nothing more nothing less meeting the  star satisfactory rating  i did have difficulty parking one night as the lot was very full  i think there may have been a wedding at the hotel  i eventually found a spot at the very edge of the parking lot maybe even the neighboring business i am not sure  the pool area looked nice but unfortunately i did not get a chance to enjoy it  there is also a small bar and restaurant in the lobby area of the hotel they had a pretty good happy hour deal on drinks|for an outdoor christmas party this place cannot be beat  two great christmas parties in two years and good timesgood service|i have ordered a cup of boba milk tea and a cup of  wow milk in my opinion the taste of wow milk is better than milk tea|came here for a quick dinner and was in and out with no problems i had the bulgogi and i really enjoyed it it was a generous portion of beef and also had a good amount of napa cabbage and other veggies usually when i want korean food im craving bulgogi and i was definitely satisfied with masijtas my grandmother really enjoyed her dolsat bibimbap so that was good too we also shared a seafood pancake that couldve been a hair crispier but otherwise was chockfull of seafood and green onions i will probably be back next time im in the mood for korean|this place has the best coffee cakes ever always friendly service and very fast and attentive staff always has great attitude considering they have to be there early hours and have to deal with all the grumpy old farts that come in they still hold it all together|this was our nd visit as a trio the food is really good of  dishes weve had nothing that wasnt fresh and nicely prepared lasagna was deep dish and layers of meat and cheese both eggplant and chicken parmigiano gave portion enough for two giuseppe ravioli was oozing cheese and comes with either   huge meatballs or italian sausages the pasta combo had enough food that my husband even had leftovers as noted in other comments the bread and tomato oil are wonderful add a fresh salad and awesome cannoli cant beat it anywhere near here i also used the yelp link to make reservations genius|food was excellent and way better than expected but they ran out of dumplings i highly recommend the fried noodles|love finding these great places that serve authentic szechuan food  we had two itemsthe sliced fish in spicy chili sauce and a sauted a choy veg side dish the a choy was fantastic well seasoned and delicious even my carnivore husband happily devoured it the fish was great too though not as good as the best version weve tasted we give it an  out f  in taste which is quite good and we enjoyed it  we would definitely eat here again the service was  very friendly prompt attentive great experience and we would recommend you give this place a try if youre it into americanized chinese food there were only two other tables and both were asian families both families had a big electric hot pot in the center of the table and the servers kept bringing them fresh ingredients to add to the pots|gia ba has some delicious dishes to offer hidden away on monkland avenue this may not be your first choice of restaurant as it requires some good walk from the metro station but parking is easy and the food deserves the effort the restaurant is more suitable for small groups unless you manage to reserve the surrounded by windows table that can accommodate ten people without a problem the very same table is not superbly comfortable as you have to sit the entire evening on wooden benches without back support on a thin cushion but allowed us to have enjoyable family style dinnerwe ordered a lot of dishes and i managed to taste most of them my five stars go to the dumplings with peanut butter sauce the absolutely amazing mushrooms with walnuts and the yummy yu xiang eggplant the eggplant is orgasmically delicious but beware heavy and kind of oily dish four stars for the chicken with peanuts and the cumin beef a little but overcrowded with onions but so tender the fried spinach was too sweet and just ok i really wanted to try the fried green beans crispy and delicious as expected they blended well in the endless mix of flavours during dinner but my last bite left an aftertaste of oil that has been used for frying a little bit more than i would like what a pleasure to have such an endless variety of beers from the far east almost every brew available in montreal was on the beer list including sapporo on tap and tall bottles of kirin the gia ba menu is long and im sure it is full of more surprises good reason to stop for dinner again|this is a low rent version of a convenience store walmartyoull find anything from household goods that range from laundry soap towels and food items if you need cheap pajamas socks or a pack of white t shirts youll find there as welloverall this an okay store however be prepared to deal with some strange characters in the parking lot trying to ask for moneywho are drunkor just downright hostile|when i was leaving gq cleaners see my review out of the corner of my eye i spotted the protein source about  storefronts down and decided to check them out  in that plaza there were about  other establishments that offered similar healthy fare yet all i wanted was a protein shaketheir menu was impressive and so i settled in on the hawaii banana strawberries pineapple vanilla whey protein and coconut water  it was filling and balanced even though it had  calories in it  it did have g of protein and a whopping g of carbs  it would have been a great postworkout shakebutuhi hadnt worked out  lol  good thing it was glutenfreeuhi guessnothing much to see here but there is likely something here that most people who are on a paleo or gluten free dietnot too bad|this doctor helped me when i was admitted into the banner desert hospital he did my surgery to remove a fibroid i knew nothing about that had burst im thankful he did that but wished the  scars i have were not visible and gone this was over a year ago and i still have the scar tissue and ive been using mederma but that gel can only do so much he is a very direct man and even told me i need to have my first child before im  which is a lot of pressure to tell a woman when they are in their early s i rather wait until im married to have kids than to be somebodys baby momma lol overall hes a nice straight forward man and if you cant deal with that then its best you dont come here|i came to the phx az location for a consult which was great the lady who helped me was nice an made me feel welcome an helped me build a package that would work best for me financially she also scheduled me later then they even take clients because of my hours at work once i came in for my appointment there was a different lady working the front desk she was very pushy on sales an different services which was annoying especially when i said ive already financed a lot so far aka no not at this time mind you my appointment was for laser tattoo removal on a new large piece on my forearm anyways the rn was great she took her time with me if i needed a break etc once it was time to check out the lady at the front proceeded to hound me for more packages when i just went through a traumatic experience laser tattoo removal is no fun an the pain comes shortly after your session by this time my arm was on fire and she was just annoying me|this was a good meal but not great if it were less expensive i would have given it  stars but when youre paying top dollar for breakfast you expect near perfection the good  nice ambiance in a quiet area of the casino clean  i love that they serve filtered water and i dont mind that they charge  for that  they claim to be farmtotable but im not sure that we had any items that were local or organic the jam and ketchup are made in house the country sausage on the breakfast plate was really outstanding the average  custard pancakes were very good though nothing special compared to any other pancakes weve eaten syrup was served warm but i couldnt taste maple syrup and i worry that it was just pancake syrup ie cheap imitation maple syrup i could be wrong but it doesnt taste like any maple syrup ive eaten caramelized onion hash brown potatoes were very good the bad  coffee was terrible  i tried changing to another cup but still awful luckily the waiter was kind enough to remove it from our bill  service was a little slow considering there is both a waiter and an assistant waiter and the restaurant was not that busy and with just two breakfasts plus water and comped coffee the bill was   tip would have been an additional  with  coffees   value  probably not thats why im rating this place as average we dont mind paying high prices when we get our moneys worth|my mother in law took us here on christmas adam its in a nice upscale area that is almost in the middle of nowhere theres tons of free parking and they have happy hour every day even on the weekendsthe inside has regular seating and spots at the teppanyaki station we had the sushi only all of the fish was fresh and absolutely delicious the presentation was beautiful and every bit was perfection a lot of their rolls are spicy so beware of that if you are not a spicy kind of personour favorite rolls were the wicked an the poppin both were so good that we kept ordering more rolls to share the prices are pretty reasonable for sushi especially considering their qualitythis place gets busy so call and make a reservation for the weekends or around the holidays|the atmosphere was really nice there were less cats than i expected and they all seemed quite shy or tired but i would understand that the ladies who worked there were super welcoming and nice  would go back|the living room has a nice energy its a great meeting place while there one of my friends had a complaint regarding the menu and bill she brought it to the attention of the bartender i wanted to compliment the bartender on how she handled the situation my friend was a little more upset than the situation really warranted and i thought that the bartender was nice professional and customer serviceoriented in this situation|i dont ask for much and i do like really nice hotels  so this was a bargain and i must have gotten lucky because my room was newly renovated i guess because it was nice clean and did its job loli have not been bombarded by sales people and i have been here for a week now  i am not sure if i should take that as a compliment or not lmaoeverything is expensive and i assumed that this was just inflated vegas prices  duh peopleduh  water is about  and  in the vending machine for smaller bottlesnothing in the gift shop is travel sized so be prepared to waste money on that if you havent done so gambling your life away lol  there are restaurants and shows here but again i came here just to sleep  not to feel as a part of the family  i tend to venture out to other hotels which is a good plan  more money to waste elsewheregive it a go|pizza is not good im sad to say  but nice staff owner on site i think very positive and pleasant|if you go here to have drinks and tapas you will probably have a good time  we had done our drinking already and just wanted some tapas  the seasonings broths and sauces were all a bit watered down and our chicken was a bit undercooked  the service was very busy serving drinks which after all is the main idea here  so if you are coming here to party you will probably have a great time if you are coming here to eat then you might be disappointedon the plus side they are open very very late and parking is okay|i live near unlv so its very convenient for me to go here and have sushi the sushi is fresh and well done not much to complain about other dishes as they are all decent the miso soup is also good all in all not the most mindblowing jirolike sushi experience ever but its convenient for unlv and the food is good highly recommended|the service and atmosphere was really good however we were told the full menu is not available in the morning   ok no biggie the chicken i was served was clearly fried the day before and then refried when i ordered it tha catfish beniet were under cooked rather than complain i just decided to bag it up and take it home and put it in the oven i must say the central location is way better|i just had my very first experience of yo sushi and i have to echo the current average three star rating there was nothing that made the sushi great no beautiful zingy flavours and the two lettuce leaves that topped it were limp and dry i wanted something light to eat on the train home and it was totally fit for this purpose but i could have bought a lovely sandwich elsewhere for a fraction of the price great sushi doesnt leave room for such thoughts and thats why id be inclined to pass straight by next timeon a positive note the service was nice and chirpy|great good servers are terrific sit at the bar on friday nights and meet great people|this is really only a  plus star review but the owner is such a nice guy i didnt want to be his first under  star rating  we tried the meat pierogies and fond them to be a little above average they were a bit gritty and didnt pop with flavor it was only after we tried them that someone said the cheese pierogies were the ones to try  we also tried the kielbasa and while the skin was crisped nicely the sausage itself had dried correspondingly i suppose he didnt cover or steam the sausage during cooking  still it was flavorful  the same comments could be made about the brats but they were a bit juicier  the price was about right and the flavor was okay so i will be going back to try the other items people rave about  it was okay and the owner was great but still do not get you expectations up that you will be astounded but you will regret the experience either|wonderful delicious vegan food in las vegas  so glad we found them  we usually eat vegan at one of steve wynns restaurants great for breakfast lunch and dinneryum|love that this place is totally vegan need more places like this in vegas but disappointed with the menu  i had the mama mia not sure if thats the name but something to that effect it was an eggplant parm dish all the flavors were great but the portions were way too small not to mention it was ish so that was disappointing dont get me wrong i get that vegan restaurants can be more expensive because they usually have a smaller clientele etc but pasta eggplant and pasta sauce are all very cheap ingredients my mom had a burrito forgot the name that turned out to be pretty bland we also had some coconut lemon cake thing which was just horrendous to put it politely this thing was a mushy bland piece of crap that embodied all stereotypes of vegan food vegan food is about bounty and amazing flavors i wish this restaurant delivered that|fresh is the word here and all for a great price i love the options and simple approach too my only small wish is for the chicken to have more flavor and not come in cubes like you would find in processed meats since we had a coupon we had a few dollars left over and chose a cookie which was not tasty and hard but we came for the fresh salads and return often|first of all the location is very misleading it is between various adult superstores and such the parking lot is quite small with only a handful of public parking stalls the rest are for the surrounding storesat first glance the interior looks and feels contemporary and fresh there are metal and wood finishes that are not too industriallooking my visit here was just okay and i will explain the dining room sits many people with booths along the walls and tables dispersed around the space despite the abundance of seats there seemed to be just a couple of servers i arrived for lunch in a party of  understandably the food was not expected to arrive quickly we waited however almost an hour for the first dish to arrive and slowly one by one we all got our dishesif not for the slow service i would have rated this place  stars the food is very delicious i got the boat noodle soup which was very flavorful and hearty i also got the crab fried rice which tasted just as i expected my friends ordered thai iced tea and if you are a fan you will love their portion sizei dont think i will be dining in here again they do have delivery service so if you are on a lunch break you might want to look into that instead|our family of  went for lunch today  i thought it was okay nothing great  the food was of high quality but portions relatively small  not much bang for your buck  i had the lunch fish and chips substituted spinach for the fries  the fish was delicious the coleslaw okay and the spinach fresh  hubby had the chicken wok  he wasnt in love but he ate the relatively small portion  son had the pot roast sandwich and ordered a side caesar salad  one ice tea and the total not including tip was   our sever was pleasant but needed to be reminded to bring certain items   noisy place   the rest of the family doesnt plan on coming back  i will give it one more shot because many of the menu items look interesting|i think i couldve read a russian novel in the time between when i placed my order and received my food seriously that was a crazy long wait to get the food were talking about a few tacos it really shouldnt take that long and our seating area was drafty plus the music was too loud and for what you get its a bit priceyhowever the tacos are quite tasty three of the four of them were very good the chorizo was soso the pork was indeed smoky the chicken was appealing too if they could improve their operation in the other areas theyd be a four star place|had vermicelli tonight i loved it i think there were more ingredients then other places it was absolutely huge  i am bring to find my new pho spot this is a  time now so i think they have won me overyay my new pho spot d|really cute restaurant atmosphere and super fun little candy and thugs storethe food was different but we enjoyed it the atmosphere is very bright and friendlygreat waitress sad i cant recall her name because my sangria was awesome and delicious along with the pita style chips and yum hummuswe all required another batch of the chips in order to finish the hummuslol the store was great fun especially for my kids and my coffee was superb we are coming back to sit outside and enjoy it more great place|not bad mexican and sicilian food love the location and atmosphere i would come back here if in cave creek again|great mail its service but why play classic rock n roll on christmas eve why not holiday music|casual atmosphere and amazing italian food highly recommend it the pizza is great the pasta is all handmade all they need is some beer and wine  will definitely be back|lotus of siam was closed for lunch but we found this location next to komol and decided to give it a try  we were very pleasantly surprised by the dcor service and the presentation and quality of the dishes  the satay was probably the best we have had anywhere and coconut ice cream with other desert goodies was a great way to end the meal  they need a liquor license so we can have a cold thai beer  we will be back to try other menu and desert items  this is a great find that no thai food fan should miss|i came here late november during lunch hour for those of you who dont know how korean bbq works there is a fire pit grill in the middle of your table and you cook the raw meats you order yourself on the fire pit the simplicity of the menu makes it easy to choose what to get options range from pork chicken and beef cuts of meat to seafood and vegetables at hwaro there are also a la carte options you can order all of which are included in the allyoucaneat deal some  items might be limited howevermy party of four all had the allyoucaneat lunch speacial we had a taste of about half of the meats on the menu we had two types of chicken octopus brisket the shit yes thats what its called and another type of beef all were delicious and tasted as expectedwe also had dessert green tea ice cream was our selection and it was vibrant with the taste of matcha a mustthe waiter was quick to change our fire pit whenever it got too black which happened about three times one thing i did not necessarily enjoy would be the rate at which our dishes were cleared i get that some places wait until the meal is over to clear the dishes but with four people at a table with our place settings fitting tightly clearing our dishes more often would have things more comfortable for us it was also inconvenient to have to pour our own water from a water bottle with four people the water goes fast and having to constantly ask for more water becomes a chore in addition to this not having a staple of rice from the beginning was a little disappointing how can you eat asian food without rice we were able to order rice but it should have been a clear option from the startallyoucaneat lunch and dinner are reasonably priced however whenever i hear all you can eat the impression i get would be to eat food as much as possible until i have been satisfied with what i have consumed during my visit i felt as if they waiters did not want us to order after the second round of ordering meats the brisket and chicken are pretty light and sharing the portions of meat with your party makes each order go fasti would not mind coming back here if invited but i did not feel as if i got my moneys worth korean bbq is great but make sure you get the value of your dining experience as advertised|great food  healthy alternative to fast food  i have never been disappointed with my meals every time i dine for lunch or dinner  i prefer the rice bowls and they are quite tasty and refreshing  if you are counting calories and want to go the healthy route they have you covered with some dishes that are vegan or low in calories  the owners and managers are attentive to your needs  i have no complaints |food was ok service was slow i would recommend coming here when its not busy or getting take out|nice little brew pub off the beaten path but worth the trip for their high quality specialty brews they have two ipas that are super tasty|the big sexy burger was awesome great balance of sweet salty and meaty would definitely keep this place in mind higher prices than most places around but a welcome new addition to the block|so after multiple check ins i finally decided to write a review  yeah yeah  we can all get lazy sometimes  lolthis last check in  i actaully tried their food for the first time  every other time that i have gone i got smoothies  more on them later  i got their daily special of turkey chili with cannellini beans  tbh i got it cuz it was warm and i was actually cold that day  lol  but i gotta give them props  if you had not told me that it was healthy i would never had thought that it was  it was freaking delicious  the mouth feel was just like a meaty chili flavor had just the small amount of heat that just made you want to take another bite  it came with some lavash which added some great crunch to the dish  i would go back just for this dish  it was that good  and to think that it was acutally healthy for me  gasp  lol  the second dish was kind of a fail for me  i love chicken lettuce wraps and i order their raw cashew chicken lettucs wraps  the look of it was cute  they served it on little butter lettuce leaves with a little micro greens on top  the flavor was not like a chicken lettuce wrap  the texture was not like a chicken lettuce wrap  and like a dummy i didnt realize until that i bit into that it was a raw food which meant that nothing was heated  so it was a cold mealy scoop of cashews mixed with something on a lettuce cup  i do not reccomend  unless you are totally into raw foods  i am guessing if i was that i might have liked it  i honestly dont know what i was expecting but i was thinking with the words chicken lettuce wrap in it that it would feel like chicken and taste like a traditional lettuce wrap in my mouth service  always impeccable  smoothies  including the veggiechino  yes u read that right  a vegetable smoothie with espresso in it  omg delicious  overall heck yeah i am going back  but next time i will definitely skip the raw foods section  lesson learned  |from the four times i have gone here i think the last experience was the only poor experience i had they were pretty busy so our food was very slow to come and even then they gave us the wrong food but the other three times have been great i would recommend it but steer clear on a weekend|i came back for drinks and everything was excellent tasty creative drinks and fabulous service i want to try the food again but this most definitely will be a regular spot for cocktails|chada street gets a solid love the ambiance very sophisticated and modern large mural like artwork behind the main bar and a visible wine cellar near the back of the restaurant dimly lit to set a warm and pleasant dining experiencethe dishes are tasty and portions are decent i went with  others and we ordered a variety to share por apia yuan veggie spring rolls w porkdelightful and came with a serving of  small pieces also had mint and basil to give it a refreshing taste and was paired with a yummy peanut dipping sauce  hor mok phucket steamed fish curry in banana leafcame out piping hot and a little fishy for those who enjoy seafood but are not a fan of food that tastes too fishy this is not a dish for you very flavorful with the slightest spicy kick to it  street chicken pad thaipretty average and a little dry definitely had better pad thai before one of my least favorite dishes i tried  kang kai nor mai chicken curry w bamboo shoot tasted like a thai red curry it was delicious does not come with white rice so if you want rice make sure to order separate chicken pad kee mowdoused in whatever sauce pad kee mow is stir fried in very flavorful though and had a lot of veggies in it moo tod nom pla fried pork bellythe fried pork belly was to die for we ordered another serving because we inhaled our first order it came with a dip that reminded me of pico de gallo a thai infused pico but the batter on the pork belly was salted perfectly and the pork belly was so juicy that i didnt even use any of the dip after my first initial try definitely a must try peak kai krob spicy chicken wings ginormous sized fried chicken wings came with  wings deliciously seasoned with a strong taste of lime and spice but the  flavors worked honey toastdelicious per usual topped with vanilla and chocolate ice cream diced fruit chocolate syrup and chopped nutsi started off with a beer but we ended up sharing a bottle of riesling to enjoy with the majority of our dinner it paired fabulously with the asian flavorsservice was on the slower side we went on a tuesday night i spotted  servers and the place was decently busy but the servers were all nice the food overall was pretty good the portions are not as small as tapas are typically served but theyre also not the largest portion if you wanted to order just one dish the size is smaller than typical thai restaurants if you order a noodle dish like pad thai or go for a curry i want to say  the normal sizei enjoyed sharing plates here and will definitely be back especially for that fried pork belly|i moved to phoenix from denver on december th  work related  having sold my home and all of its contents everything to my son and his fianc i arrived in phoenix with the intention of staying at an extendedstay hotel while i searched for a home  after the first night i realized that i needed to find a more permanent temporary residence and decided to look for an apartment  a friend who lives in the area suggested broadstone sixteen  i visited the property and met with kelsey who was terrific  i left and returned within a couple of hours to lease the apartment  this was the only complex i visited  my movein date was scheduled for the next day saturday december thduring the leasing process i had many facetoface conversations with kelsey or lasette  many times they needed to get guidance or approval from jasmene  at no point  and still not to this day  did jasmene come out of her office to introduce herself and welcome me to the community   at one point she walked through the lobby made direct eye contact with me and just kept walking  not even a hello  as a complex that has leaseup goals and neeing to meet the eoy numbers one would think that jasmene would want to engage with everyone to promote the positive word of mouth  there is a difference between a leader and a manager  she is the latter kelsey lasette and margaret have been outstandingoverall construction   led light bulbs should be installed vs cfls  comfort height toilets should be installed vs the low height toilets  a shelf needs to be installed in

model with limited options  there should be under cabinet lights installed in the kitchen  the light switch for the pendant lights is not in a user friendly location  one has to walk around the bar to turn on the lights  the trash chute is too small for the average bag gallonmy movein was quick so these things might have been corrected if there was more time before my movein date   none of the outlets above the kitchen counter worked  the outlets below the counter on the bar portion of the kitchen did not work  the outlet above the toilet did not work  the top light in the refrigerator did not work  the back side of the stove exhaust duct was not finished and air exhausted into the cabinets instead of outside  these items have all been corrected  the overall cleanliness of the apartment at movein was ok  the exterior of all cabinets especially the lower units had water spots  marks  parking  it is not yet a major issue but can imagine that as the occupancy increase this will be a frustration point for many residents  i have a reserved spot in the underground parking garage  the spaces are too narrow  fortunately there is no one using the space next to mine when that space is occupied there will be issues for both that person and myself  perhaps there should be some wider spaces scattered throughout the parking areas that could be rented for a small fee for those that desired more roomcommon areas  for the most part these are maintained however there are numerous stains in the corridor carpets on all floors and often the same debris is observed for several days in a row indicating they are not vacuumed on a regular basis or that the frequency needs to be increased  even though there is a secured bike storage area bikes are routinely locked to the cage by the elevator in the underground parking garage  smoking  it was made clear  and i signed documents  that the entire complex is nonsmoking  i have observed numerous residents smoking  walking around the complex on their balconies in the underground parking garage  when i mentioned this to the office i was told that management and the corporate office is still trying to work out the smoking issues and that nothing is being done at this point unless it becomes really bothersome to a resident  why even have the policy in the first place  remove all references to nonsmoking community in your collateral and online presence as this is simply not trueat the end of the day im ok with living here as i know that this is temporary as i search for a home  the location is close to my office   minutes or less  kelsey lasette and margaret are all very personable helpful and just an allaround pleasure not the same feeling about jasmene  the rental rates are a little on the highside  there will be hickups with any new construction project  those are understandable  it is how the staff reacts that is important  on a scale of    i would rate my experience thus far as an |service is very fast and friendly now the food i might be picky but its obviously not the real lebanese shish taouk and garlic sauce but definitely better than any other lebanese fast food|friendly staff and food is good spacious inside also not loud like pho kim long portions are big egg rolls are equal to  pieces when compared to other vietnamese  restaurants   large is more like x large compare to others  i found a vietnamese  restaurant  i like good good good|the physical restaurant is pretty hip with more of a bar vibe  we were there for lunch so it basically came off as loud  i heard so much about the food and it was good but not great  the menu is definitely creative with varieties of grilled cheese but little variation  our bill for  for lunch was  with tip no booze so not cheap  all in all worth trying once but seemed more of a novelty than pittsburgh staple restaurant|flower child is part of fox restaurant concepts which is in my opinion one of the best chain of restaurants anyway this was my first time here but i have heard many great things about it you walk in order take a number a seat and then your food will magically appear in a timely fashion i ordered the winter sunshine salad with chicken while my boyfriend got the forbidden rice bowl with chicken both very good but the portion is small for the price flower child also has a variety of ice teas and lemonades that i believe are made in house and you can refill for freeservice is very friendly and fast the decor is very fitting with the name of the restaurant its beautiful and fun there is a patio outside which during the day or when its not winter in arizona i can see being a great choice i would come here again|ive returned here primarily for work lunches and happy hours several times since the initial review and sadly things are slipping especially in the service departmentthe last visit saw a small group of mine arrive at around pm on a wednesday and was the epitome of all of my recently disappointing visits there were two other people sitting at the bar having drinks the rest of the place was completely empty we grabbed one of the tall hightop tables which was very wobbly and unsteady the legs are already loose and waited for someone to come over toward usthe bartender noticed us but said nothing he eventually walked past our table while going to the back area to do something walked past it again and went about doing things behind the bar after a few more minutes i walked up to him and asked do we order at the bar or will you have table serviceoh sorry dude he said ill be right over to help you guys thank you for your patienceodd why not mention this when youre walking by or if youre not feeling like table service giving us a nod and sharing a would you mind ordering at the bar ignoring customers when its plainly obvious isnt  or stars worthyso he comes over to take our orders my coworker asks for a pbr he says cant do it dude we dont have it coworker tries to order a coors and again no can do my man we dont have any of the domestic macros ok so he settles on a samuel adams then its my turn one barrel penguin please bartender says whats that who makes that i said one barrel from madison he says hmm i dont think we have it ive never heard of it i show it to him on the ipad and he says look i believe you man but i dont think we have it here i told him that id gladly take a sierra nevada pale ale if he couldnt find the penguinrest of the table places their orders and the bartender arrives with all of the beer except for mine he says hey dude what was the name of that beer again ugh i told him and then walked over to the coolers and immediately spotted the bright blue label oh that one he said as he reached in and handed me the bottlefast forward a new server came by and when we inquired as to why wob didnt carry pbr she said oh we totally do have it we also have coors coors light etc etc etc so what gives final straws that have me bordering between  and stars food is declining pretzels have been quite dry and over cooked on last  visits how many managers do they have here and do they all conduct their business in the dining area there seems to always be someone talking to vendors or sitting around doing piles of paperwork or talking with employees in a meetinglike setting id say cut down on some of the administrative overhead and focus on customer serviceaccurate answers|so simple yet so good the chicken here is pretty close to perfection its slippery and juicy with yummy skin  served with rice that was cooked in the chicken broth a little too salty for my taste and with  great sauces everything on the plate was clearly made with love id also recommend splurging and getting the lap cheung sausage as well because who doesnt love sausage my only complaints are location  weird place and restaurant is too small price  i get it the chicken is organic and farmed in cabut i could prob get hainan chicken rice for  the price in chinatown hours  seriously you close at pm sadface|wonderful friendly accommodating customer service nice atmosphere the coffee kept coming and was good but the food was underwhelming biscuits and gravy were mediocre griddlecake was dry not golden brown or fluffy see photo|ooh another container store this one is probably a little smaller than the one in north scottsdale but they still have a good selection of anything household and travel related that is containerlike as any organizational store should be everything is clearly labeled and easy to find my organizational skills around the house still need a bit of work but thanks to the container store my place is less of a case study on the forces of entropy |service is excellent and the spaciousness and high ceilings of the restaurant made the experience enjoyable  i enjoyed their manhattan on the rocks cocktail if anyone is a fan of this drinkthe farmpot veggies appetizer is delicious  the oz bonein ribeye was awesome too|being a californian i get really excited whenever i see shake shack because sadly we dont have all of this goodness out there  ive only been to two other shake shacks other than this one one of which is the one in new york new york on the strip  today i ordered a burger with fries no cheese and the vanilla concrete  the burger although very good and fresh seemed to have a soggier bun than the buns that i had at my previous visits to shake shack  otherwise the burger was pretty delicious  i have no idea what that shake sauce is but it is pretty darn good  the patty was well seasoned and very fresh unfortunately the fries are nothing to write home about  they are crispy and tasty dont get me wrong but  they are nothing notable  they taste pretty similar to freezer fries  the vanilla concrete didnt taste much different from any regular blizzardfreezemcflurry like concoction  a single is pretty small and might not be worth the for fast food shake shack is pretty expensive  but the burgers are so good and fresh that i always come back  the service here is very fast and friendly as well  and a huge plus is that this location is much less busy than the one on the strip  of course|stumbled upon this place looking for random things to try cookies and ice cream any way you want yep im in  this place is located smack dab in the middle of a shopping mall with several other restaurants making it an ideal location for those looking for something sweet after their meal  walked in and the staff greeted you right away and were amazing  the ladies behind the counter took the time to explain what they have to offer how it works and even let you sample a flavor if you were unsure  perfect ice cream parlor servicethe lay out is super clean but i could see it being very crowded and hard to move about during peak times of day and especially during the hotter months when the crowds are in full effectwe went with four different ice cream sandwiches on this particular outing  the oatmeal raisin cookie with cookie dough ice cream peanut butter cookie with cookie dough ice cream carnival cookie with cookie dough ice cream and their brownie with rocky caramel chocolate ice cream  the cookies and brownies were a little stale on this day  but that could have been due to our arriving almost at they end of the day they do heat them up prior to service which always helps  add the ice cream in the middle and its served in a small paper wrapper for you to holdall the sandwiches were full of flavor but very rich easily could have only gotten two items and split it between the four of us  the ice cream starts to melt pretty quick due the hot cookies which makes a little mess but that is no big deal and you can get spoons to help out with thisall and all its a great take on the ice cream sandwich  the staleness of the cookies and richness of the entire the entire desert will drop this rating a little  definitely not writing cream off as there is great potential i will give it another try when the ice cream craving hits again|tried this place for the first time today i was not expecting much seeing as how it is a franchise but i was very impressed the service was excellent the price was right i got the lunch special  pizza and  salad which is available mondayfriday between ampm for  great value i had the mediterranean salad and rustica pizza both were outstanding definitely recommend some reviewers seem to be complaining that there wasnt any sauce on the pizza read the menu before you order if there is a hollow yellow circle next to the item the crust is brushed with olive oil if there is a red filled in circle the crust has traditional red pizza sauce the manager was very visible and friendly my only complaint and the reason for  stars instead of  is where we were seated the place was virtually empty but we were seated in a booth right next to the entrance the restaurant phone kept ringing quite loudly directly behind me something to keep in mind for those in charge|cafe hollander is much like a kardashianit gets a lot of attention but underneath its soulless based in milwaukee the restaurant group behind hollander uses the same formulaic approach to its restaurants put up some faux kitchsy decor and serve average food and watch people line up|i am a big fan of the glasgow original so was delighted when bread meats bread opened on lothian road  no bookings accepted relaxed vibe booths available  menu  sloppy burgers  from a basic cheeseburger through to some monsters eg lothian wolf pulled pork burger  grilled sandwiches and grilled cheese also available  yet to try the poutine  fries various sides and oddly soup  nice selection of beer  not massively craft but reasonable enough  attentive friendly service|this was the first ramen place ive eaten at in arizona and i was told by a friend that this was probably the best ramen hes had in phoenix but not near california quality i typically get my ramen fix in new york and california the most recent was a place in sf so i went into the restaurant with some hope but realistic expectations my sister and i came here on a weekday around pm and it was empty this worked in our favor as we got seated and served right away though ive heard from others that theyve had to wait a bit even after the typical lunch rush we got the takoyaki to start and it was better than the ramen in my opinion i got the classic tonkatsu and my sister got the ultra spicy ramen the tonkatsu was alright it wasnt as flavorful as others i have had and the egg was hard boiled thats disappointing because i like soft boiled eggs generally my sister got the ultra spicy ramen and she said it wasnt as spicy as the server made it out to be or lookedoverall its alright i gave it a  star ultimately since i wanted to be fair and not compare this place to the ramen of new york andor california|my friends and i decided to meet up here for happy hour since the summerlin one was temporarily closed for remodeling i like the design and set up of this location super las vegas stripped out the only sucky part is walking through basically the entire mall to get to itfood wise its cheap and good we had about  rolls and two other apps as well as four sakes and the total came to around  cant beat that my favorite here is always the tuna wonton crisps and the atlantic roll was good toothe only reasons for not giving a five star review is how limited the table space is and the service was so so we had to track down a waitress to get another roll ordered before happy ended at |the grape leaves and baklava here taste just like my grandmother makes i have also tried the falafel pita and fries my friend had the beef shawarma plate and loved it some of the flavors arent as strong as im used to but overall this place is fantastic i also love that they carry flavored sanpellegrino and lemonades|this is my first visit to this location of the cheese cake factory i was pleasantly surprised with the variety of skinilicious selections the food was not out of the ordinary but the deserts were exceptional service was extraordinary as well staff was courteous and prompt i will visit again just for the red velvet cheesecake|located by the harkins movie theater in norterra newlyopened fractured prune doughnuts offers an array of sweet treats served up with friendly service ill admit that when i came across fractured prune doughnuts the only thing mildly appealing about their name was the word doughnuts prune donuts no luckily their odd name has nothing to do with the shriveled up plums typically reserved for those trying to stay regular the shop is purportedly named after a local s athlete named prunella whose brittle bones earned her the nickname fractured prune not sure if its the best name for a donut shop but anywayhistory lesson over  lets move on to the treatsnow i recognize that there are a lot of boutiquestyle donut shops all over the country not unlike the cupcake craze these eateries try to wow consumers with a dizzying array of decadent and unusual toppings fractured prune is no different they have everything from marshmallow madness marshmallow glaze topped with marshmallows to the seemingly now ubiquitous bacon bomb bacon and cinnamon  is this bacon fad ever going to end unlike many donut places that offer different types of base doughs cake raised chocolate pumpkin spice etc fractured prune only offers one  a basic cake donut like krispy kreme they take the base donuts and simply dip them into different glazes and add toppings the good news is that when that inner tube of cake dough reaches its destination after floating down the hot grease river yes like kk you can watch the entire journey the result is decadent and delicious also unlike other shops where they make all the donuts and display them in the window they wont dip your donuts until you order them so they are guaranteed freshyou order by using a handy paper slip describing each of their creations you can also flip the script and make your own i opted for the salted caramel and the ms prunellathe salted caramel is exactly what you would expect the aforementioned cake donut dipped in a caramel glaze and topped with sea salt it came in a tray and it looked like a hot mess so i went seinfeld and attacked it with a fork and knife the cake itself was heavenly  piping hot with the perfect texture it was a bit on the greasy side which i suppose is to be expected the caramel glaze was a little runnier that i wouldve liked but still nice and sweet unfortunately it seemed like all the flavors were completed overshadowed by the salt it was very salty i am a sucker for salted caramel treats and i like that hint of saltiness to balance out what is typically an oversweet dessert but in this case it was just too muchwaterbreak they have a water cooler tucked away in the back corner great palatecleansernext on to ms prunella i supposed that this would be the closest thing to their signature donut and that is why i ordered it it starts again with the basic cake donut this time dipped in a mixed berry glaze and topped with cinnamon sugar this one was much more palatable  the sweettart of the mixed berry glaze hit the spot this is one i would order againall in all i enjoyed trying out fractured prune it was a nice treat on a relatively cool day if you do decide to try them out i would recommend that you eat them right away so you can properly enjoy that hot dough at  a pop they arent necessarily cheap but they arent even close to some of the ridiculous prices you see people paying for those fancy cupcakesenjoy|i used to come here a lot about  years ago but then i stopped for one reason or anotheri came back again tonight after the long hiatus and i was disappointed the deep dish personal pepperoni pizza wasnt very good  the sauce tasted bland the crust tasted oily and a bit overcooked or stale and there wasnt much flavor to the cheese i havent been feeling well and thought it might just be me but my husband tried it and said the same thing he also said his chicken parmesan sauce tasted blandi feel bad  it was a little like looking at an old taylor swift album you used to love five years ago except now you realize the songs were sappy and she looked completely different i used to love uno but its not at all what i remembered it to be|seemed a little stuffy food was a bit over priced and kind of overly fancy for my tastes  very nice atmosphere though friendly staff  just not for me i suppose|theyre open againtheir pizza bagels are my absolute favorite and they bring back memories i used to love grabbing a pizza bagel and an italian ice after school or after softball games id sit in the booths and stare at the walls that had millions of pictures on them i even snuck a school picture of myself behind the plexiglass then id grab a gum ball from the big machine by the front doorthey just recently reopened and im so happy to be able to taste my childhood again their bagels are just like how i remember|when i saw that this place was featured on diners driveins and dives i was immediately soldthe decor felt like grandmas house little knickknacks everywhere and the signs are hilarious the staff constantly bussed tables at an impressive speed we sat at the window seat awesome for people watching food was excellent certainly one of the best brunches ive ever had i ordered a veggie omelette and my boyfriend got an italian jumbot my omelette was packed with delicious veggies and his jumbot had these perfect crispy little homefries dorstop only gets  versus  stars due to lackluster service our waitress did her job properly however we did not get her name no smile no friendliness that you would expect at such a cozy establishment i left feeling empty in my heart but not my stomach|i walk past this gym a couple of times a week when i make my excursion to the businesses coffee shops and true runner yes i am a runner along walnut street before i got my membership i had thought that this was a small gym with a hefty price tag from the outside i saw a lot of ellipticals and treadmills through the firstfloor window and people doing bodyweight workouts and deadlifts through the secondfloor window next door there was a small space that used to be a smoothie bar but is now closed at that time i already had a gym membership on south highland but i really wanted to join a few classes like bodypump and spinning la fitness in bakery square was pretty close but i heard horror stories about the facility and its membership contracts club one was closer but i thought its member demographics would be a bit on the older side for me so i contemplated joining x shadyside which i found offered classesi walked in one day and a sign at the firstfloor desk said to go to the second floor for inquiries before i did that i quickly explored the first floor first thing i noticed was that there was an abundant number of cardio machines from treadmills to ellipticals to stationary bicycles my cursory estimate would be at least  machines total there were also two small rooms to the side the first being a miniweight room and the second being a spin class room containing over  stationary bicyclesi walked upstairs which i quickly saw was for classes weightlifting and yoga and pilates i spoke with someone at the front desk about its membership they explained what their gym offers including classes such as abs spinning bodypump bodyattack px and insanity they also offer separate locker rooms with showers and lockers available to all and for rent for an additional fee no towel service though i did a quick tour of the rest of the gym and found that all the machines were in clean working condition the bathrooms were clean with some body odor which is to be expected and the classroom was fairly large and free to use whenever they are not having a class i liked what i saw so i asked for their membership fee because im a upmc employee they offered a discount i paid a  initiation fee and the first month fee of  the monthly payments will be  hereafterive been going to this gym for almost two months and im pleased with the exception of peak hours there usually are no lines for the machines and weights ive attended their spinning classes and the trainers knew how to motivate us to push our limits i always walked out feeling both exhausted and energizedsome minor issues about this gym is that a few machines were broken bicycle pedals water bottle holders not a true  gym mf  am to  pm sat  am to  pm sun  am to  pm and difficulty parking not a big issue for me because i always walkjogbike here|its tucked away from the street  they had a wide variety of beautiful pieces  upon entering the staff was nice enough  they greeted me from the couch and offered to help me  the designers are top notch and the prices match|we came with a list of custom amounts for a beer home brew upon entry we kinda looked around and found bulk size items and nothing that we really needed it was the first time weve been to this location and i dont think there was any advertisement of offering specific amounts of grains oats malt and barley after a few moments we went to the front and asked for help to get the specific items the guy got them all and milled the ingredients for us excellent prices for what we received comparable to most online prices for recipes just expect the people to leave you be and not harass you|soho is my goto lunch spot at least once a week the lovely sisters who own and run the place are friendly and charming the service is fast and the menu has something for everyone at a very reasonable price|here last night for the movies and almost past the movie theater driving by if you see a sign that says park terrace it is the regal cinemas this is a very small theater was here for a  pm movie and they had partitioned off one side of the theater as well as the bathroom too only three stalls on the right side the floors were sticky not crazy about establishments that have sticky bathroom floors i am less like to get food from a concession standnice size movie theater went all the way up the stairs and headed towards the last row why because these seats have more leg room after a long day of shopping at park road shopping center just walk on over and take in a movie|they do a great job mani pedis are greatthey work well and are always timelyhighly recommend you trythe owner is very caring|lacking a music nerd friend who will let you dig through their massive vinyl collection in the garage while talking your ear off about various musical minutiaeresale records is here to fill the void located in the most random prefab shack on commercial avenue its a bit dark fairly musty but full of good finds at reasonable prices while some of the other patrons eyed us warily when we walked in the owner was very inviting he explained to us how the shop was set up and asked what we were looking for i was just browsing and after giving me about  minutes he came back to see what i usually purchased i am not a vinyl collector  i just nab things that look interesting or that i enjoy so i told him as much and he left me to my digging most records at least in the rock bins were priced around   totally reasonable for the selection and condition therere also several crates of dollar records and a decent selection of cassette tapes  i considered walking away with inxss kick but thats really more of a driving tape and my car lacks a cassette player while we were browsing the owner and a presumable couple of regulars chatted at length about a canadian rock show similar to nights with alice cooper that he managed to pick up on the radio that centered on randy bachmann  i forget what the debate was about but it was lively and nerdy and i loved eavesdropping on every second of it make a trek one weekend and check it out  its an anachronistic little slice of the rock and roll life|disclaimer i am not from chicago my family is however and ive brought them here before and they all were impressed with lukes heres the deal i became addicted to lukes back when i worked at their other location now defunct in scottsdale many years ago as a teenager the beef sandwiches were all awesome and the sweet peppers were my favorite at this location i stop in for a combo beef and sausage with cheese and sweet peppers i then finish my order off with a hires root beer and a large fries and i am in heaven it really is the best beef in phoenix the ambiance of the place screams chicago like many others have noted on yelp the service also screams chicago in the sense that the service isnt friendly on my last visit the guy had literally nothing to say to me and he took my order at the pace of a snail it is what it is authentic in a good and bad way cant have one without the other yes lukes will get my money on occasion it will remain that way|when we walked into the restaurant my hopes for delicious food were elevated because the scent of delicious chinese food filled the air we sat down we were served some tea and not too long after a sweet woman came by to take our order my heart was set on orange chicken which was not on the menu i decided to ask anyway and she happily responded well make itjust for you i really really really wanted to like the food here but i didnt to be fair i am partial to another valley restaurant to satiate my chinese food cravings the food lacked flavor and didnt have that authentic feel to it i mean ive never been to china personally but id imagine there would be more flavor involved in the dishes the only reason i rated this place so high is because of the service everyone that we interacted with was just so nice and funny one of the gentlemen there made some jokes wished us a merry christmas and gave us candy canes super sweet good customer service is very important to me and will make or break a place for me bottom line  you know that sweet auntie or cousin you have that loves to entertain and cook dinners for you but you dont have the heart to tell them you dont like their cooking thats what this place reminds me of|nice grounds adequate room   very expensive  good bar   not sure its worth the money as there are equally fine options for less money in the vicinity|the family atmosphere rocks and its a no brainer but three stars as the internet sucks dont even bother bringing a tablet to watch because the equipment has no updated tvs and such no reception ridiculousness   cafe prices have gotten out of hand what is happening here  if lifetime fitness opened down the street the village would be in trouble|a very nice starbucks location with a community vibe so recently i was looking to add another nice starbucks location to my list of working spots as i was getting a little bored of some of the others that i spend time at what makes this one a little different is the extra seating inside for getting work done there are a lot of places to sit inside the other thing that sets this starbucks apart is the fact that this one is one of the only locations ive been to where the baristas know the customers and talk to them there is a palpable community vibe at this location when i come in there are lots of soccer moms with their kids in the afternoon older folks who are there everyday and stopin customers who get drinks to go but still talk to the baristas this starbucks is nice because the vibe of it seems to be regulars who enjoy that location and the baristas seem to have been there for a while and are comfortable with the customers i really like that and for those reasons i will definitely be stopping back in soon|flawless pedicure okay manicure very very slow service its a good thing i wasnt in a hurry i made appointments for my sister and me the day before and then they worked on us one at a time so we each had to wait for the other i might be back for a pedicure but not for a manicure and only if its just me too slow otherwise|loved it  delicious and authentic mexican food  dont come here in your nice car but everything else about the place is fun and yummy|its a really good airport over all but you just have to get in a little earlier than smaller airports like austin or richmond if youre doing the rub run rudolph dash for your flight you wont make it here the gates are farrrrrr i rated  stars because i wish they had more healthy food choices|the food is quite good and the place is extremely clean the two gals who run this place are usually rude they act like they are doing you a favor by serving you lots of frowns|although this theme park is fun there is poor management when we were in line for desert storm people kept cutting the line when we notified the workers they said it was not their problem so rude plus i could not go on some of the rides because there were no workers operating the attraction   however i enjoyed the rides they are in good shape and arent too old they recently opened a new ride called xd dark ride i think which is a shooting game simulator the bumper boats were a lot more fun than they look and a ship shoots water out which can get you wet the log ride was also a highlight of our day along with desert storm overall i give this park  stars and i will most likely be coming back|i have fairly simple nail needs so i tend to just wanting a relaxing pedicure occasionally in a nice clean locale i really like bamboo nails and ive always had a good experience here including the time the two techs working with me had a long conversation on politics education systems classical music and karaoke so hey i especially like the pedicures here with the salt scrub and paraffin wax treatments|stopped in here during a recent vacation in the area we enjoyed the train ride and learned about the goldmining history of the area from the tour guide while the ghost town itself is free a lot of the attractions are an extra dollar or two or five budget at least  for a family of  to visit|fun place to have lunch or dinner great for sports watching lots of food choices and great choice of beers|burritos are amazing and the small is perfect size the salsa needs a lot of work a bit too runny and not much flavor the chips were also a bit stale stick with the burritos and youll be happy|so after two times here with poor service at this location manuels redeemed itself the food was top quality and the service was impeccable it was attentive prompt and preemptive the water and salsa never ran dry the waiter i think his name is bob was friendly and personable im glad to see manuels is back to how i loved it i always get the  combo unless i come on a monday and get the special with the same things shredded beef taco cheese enchilada and beans we also get a cheese crisp|every summer the gypsies would come to our little town to set up shop and sell their wares which included pillow cleaning and reticking since phoenix seems to have a shortage on gypsies i have had a hard time finding places who clean and refresh feather pillows until i stumbled across ravei dropped them off and was told it may take a week or so for my  standard pillows to be cleaned  cool no problems there  they also offer mail service for people living outside of the phx area i got a call that my pillows were done and they are great  nice and soft double lined with  egyptian cotton shells to prevent mites and feather puncture  each pillow also has a tag with a cleaned date so i know when to get them cleaned again which is a nice touch  also included was a tag receipt  so i know it is my pillow and a pass for harmful substances test tagthe only reason i didnt give them  stars is their website listed a standard down and feather mix pillow at  but i was charged  for each of my pillows|we love this relaxed atmosphere  the  new menu us superb so much to choose from  the  for  menu is budget friendly and fed  of us  our waiter keenan was great he was very thorough and attentive well worth a dinner the night before christmas  eve|i found the food and service at this chipotle to be above standard stopped in for lunch one afternoon with a friend and ordered my usual burrito my friend also had a burrito and we shared a chips and salsa the chicken tasted fresh and the service was quick and good upon sitting down i noticed how clean the restaurant actually was the place was spotless even while we were there an employee was walking around with a rag and cleaning tables the place got busy and there was eventually a line but the restaurant was wellmanaged i had never been to this location before but i have to say i would definitely recommend it my only gripe with this place was that once you are in the plaza this wasnt actually the easiest place to find you can only see it from tbird not from inside the plaza it is near the starbucks and the cake place|i wish i could try something other than the korean chicken saimin or loco moco but its just too good i have had the fried rice which is also excellent im a creature of habit the service is always good i feel hawaiian just walking in the joint  the people who work there are always very nice to me  make me feel welcome i always leave full  still have money left i always wanted to try it for breakfast  hopefully one day i will|i was in the line to pay and the lady asked me if a have a macys card and she was really rude bc i didnt have a macys card the service  should be the same even if you dont have a macys card sad because i ended up spending the same or more money that the person in front of me with macys card|went here for a recall and they were okay i usually have nothing but pleasant experiences at toyota except for the david wilson location bad experience hank you for taking care of me here|good service great tasting appetizers and entrees dessert was also good this came as a complete shock to me as i tend to stay away from the chain restaurants but i would absolutely recommend them and specifically this location because of their service and great quality|the food is always good here but the service always seems rushed and the host staff is very unpleasant  we come here often for the food but again the service is almost a turn off|nice atmosphere service was awesome as they were always checking up on us chicken pad thai and fried rice was delish|pier  is one of my favorite stores for seasonal home decor i have been going to this store for the last couple of years and have always enjoyed their selection quality of product and most importantly excellent customer service they also have a pretty vast clearance section toward the back and at times you can get entire dining sets at the clearance price on occasion i was able to get almost entire dinnerware sets i was short a salad bowl but had dessert plates regular plates a tray  salad bowls and a large salad bowl they offered to call another store in the area to see if they had the one extra salad bowl so i could complete my set but it really was not that big of a deal items that were typically anywhere between  a piece ranged in the  a piece i always get compliments on my dinnerware and holiday decor i think pier  is a great happy medium between super cheap home items and the over the top overpriced name brands|we needed our carpets done immediately we called several places and nobody could come out the same day when we called a one not only did they come out that same day their staff was friendly and professional i liked that they even wore booties when they came into our homewe could not be happier with the service they provided us carpets looked almost new and dried in just a couple hours thank you a one for all your help we will totally be using you guys again and telling our friends|very popular  fresh and tasty food  i had the carnitas chimichamga and a strawberry margarita  had to ask for my margarita twice  food took a long time but arrived hot and tasty  very noisy with the water and light show if you sit on the veranda  the entire sams town experience reminded me of boomtown in reno  interesting characters and lots of kids  an upscale truck stop with a family theme|very clean and service was exceptional i will come here often the only downfall is the parking its near desert shores so no one there is in a hurry to do anything|wellbeen theredone thatwill do again when in las vegas i watch diners driveins and dives regularly this place was one of the stops i have been waiting and plotting our trip since seeing it on the show first off  review is for the grill portion the meat shop was so packed couldnt get in to look around have to come back when its not a holidayour experience began by getting out of the car and being lured to the counter by the delicious smell of bbq once there we enjoyed a positive and amusing ordering process with the easy going gentleman behind the counter he assisted us with choosing between tips and ribs with a flip of the coin on to get the food and eating itthe food we ordered  threemeat plates to share among  people we ended up with hot links brisket rib tipsand with mistake ended up sampling pork ribs green beans mac and cheese cornbread were the sides

smells the positive and engaging staff and the food|the area is charming and right across the bridge and within walking distance from a major shopping area very convenient the apartment complex is great and people are usually friendly lots of kids the classic apartment that we have is a deluxe classic and its very quaint the kitchen appliances are a bit outdated but we work with them just fine the buildings themselves though are a in need of repair in my honest opinion every soft step our new neighbors make above us makes the most horrible creaking noises and at times sounds like theyre coming through the ceiling unnerving indeed the pet deposit is way too expensive so we have to have someone watch our cat until we can save up enough just to bring her in my children really love the area and their bus stop is right around the corner the complex is absolutely amazing with all its features maintenance is really good about getting things fixed for us so thats a plus there are only very minor issues that bother me all in all were pleased with this place|the pho was really yummy it was our first time there  we had the  with two orders of spring rolls since it was on the way to our doctors office we decided to check it out the atmosphere was good the service was fast and friendly|delicious at an amazing price whenever my family and i are around the south side we stop in to get their pretzels its a staple of the burgh the people that are giving this shop a bad review arent familiar with the place|mostly clean but a big fresh stain on one wall and a ceiling with water stains marred the experience smelled strongly of cigarettes yet was nonsmoking perhaps from people smoking in the hallways which smelled of smoke even more not okay in my book beds were comfortable with a nice assortment of pillows no indoor pool quiet fairly convenient to downtown by pittsburgh standards by car or free shuttlefree parking friendly staff|the white winter sangria was amazing and strong like i needed and jamaican jerk tacos were to die for and the roasted veggies and quinoa with it was great wanna take some more home|a little disappointed with the menu this is actually the americanized middle eastern food they have major things on the menu hunmus babagonush but doesnt taste that good moreover i was looking for turkish tea and the waitress suggested the arabian coffee is the closest thing they have how wonderful in summary a good eat at a decent price but dont expect authentic middle eastern food|ive been taking krav maga here for many months  the studio is small but clean and well equipped and maintained  after studying martial arts in a few different studios usa pro stands out thanks to the sensei george  you couldnt ask for a friendlier more good natured teacher  he also knows his stuff and creates balanced engaging dynamic and well structured classesany parent or student considering the studio can be confident that they and theirs will develop their physical and mental strength and discipline in a positive and supportive environment  in karate kid terms if your philosophy is more mr miyagi than than cobra kai than this is the dojo for you|been a

love fish tacos and have had them from all over these were very tasty loved the bbq and thoroughly enjoyed the black black bean and rice on the side to give my tacos more filling i was surprised pleasantly how full of fish they actually were  which is another reason why this place gets a great review i highly recommend trying this place if you enjoy fish or shrimp tacos|finally went and dine at jasons deli last night after the movies perfect location across the street from park road shopping center everything is pretty much closed at  pm except for the movie theater have been ordering and taking out from jasons for business meeting as well as on the gojasons deli is not like your typical deli its has a little bit of everything reminds me of a cafeteria growing up they have a salad bar and with a good selection to choose from they had miniature gingerbread muffin which was so good pop one and you are addicted to wanting more only tried onethe lobster chowder is out of this world got it in a cup which was savory and so richcreamy they should call it lobster bisque for sure what kind of liquor did they put in sherry you definitely need to try this out my regular is hot pastrami on rye with mustard it was good and comes with a side of chips we also ordered  a sandwich with salad and came with a side of chips too great place to bring the family for food is nice size portion to share with othersdo not forget to get your free ice cream make your own soft ice cream with flavors or vanilla chocolate or swirlcombo of bothnice and quite last night there were other patrons at the deli at  pm|nice place and good food court choices but the place needs more teen friendly stores |its chillis love the chicken enchilada soup as of late ive been enjoying the texmex menu otherwise i generally get the appetizer sampler as my entree ive never received terrible service at this location theyre never packed either ill be back|if you get anything besides the fondue youre making a

the fondue is very hit or miss hence  stars i wish theyd expand on their swiss heritage|i have been very pleased with the price and quality of my gel nails and how friendly the staff has been  lisa has been great  also it has been clean and sterile|i have no idea how to rate this experience because it was an experience a brief list of things that you will find at giligins  a very very aggressive train ride  a very convincing electric chair that makes very convincing noises  a pole  a table upon which you can play flip cup no one will even think about stopping you  plenty of places to hide should your boss decide to use the restroom and your group decide to hide from him  fun i think|busser was horrible  dropped my to go food two times other than that pretty tasteful food|i had a great experience today at mark kia doug was amazing with listening to my needs and how much i wanted to spend on a car doug really worked his magic and i walked out with a brand new  fully loaded kia soul austin in the finance department was also amazing he explained everything great and gave me a great warranty plan thanks guys|ok so i stopped in for an oreo blizzard the other day on my way to tempe and i found this location to be nice clean and friendly the drive thru is easy enough to navigate plus there is a ton of parking at this location it is easy to miss though because it doesnt necessarily stand out as you are driving along scottsdale road the outdoor seating is nice though and there is plenty of it theres not much else for me to say about this location other than it is a nicer dq and its friendly god bless dairy queen stars|my husband and i did the  hour touryou can buy tickets online to save a few dollars nice gift shop with interesting architectural books the tour guide was friendly and informative the house itself is looking a bit dated some of the best views are from outside|this oregano somehow stands out among all in the valley may be for the ambience locality and the wait staffall the wait staff recommendations on our first visit were awesome no complaints true to the taste as mentioned very flavorful and encouraged me to try them againthis is as good as it gets we sat outside in a nice weather which was a plus pointi would strongly recommend this place|things are getting better and that is because i was in the lower level this time around the sightlines are better and so are the concessions although those remain normally pricey the parking lot was not in as bad shape last year but then again the arena was only  full bottom line is get to the area early to park for free because almost  minutes before the game most of westgate was already filled the howling coyote and the ice skating ice girl patrol are both good touches and this place does have a good hockey atmosphere|ive been wanting to eat here for years and finally did i was expecting so much more tho my blt was fantastic but another person in my party ordered the blt and her bread was over toasted the service on the other hand the waitress nicole i think was rather rude she had a bit of an attitude when telling her what couples where on what tab then rolled her eyes when another person asked for a mixed drink she also was rude when clearing off the tables but realized it and finally said excuse me but again with a bit of a attitude the bar tender was also pretty rude im not sure if it was his first night working in a higher end restaurant but when i went to the bar before happy hour was over he lied and told me happy hour was over and that i would have to order my drink from my server i later found out you couldnt order a drink from the bar if you had a table but the happy hour only took place in the bar we would have loved to sat in the bar area but they didnt have a table large enough for all of us other than those  the place was good the other servers were on point when filling up our waters and making sure we had plenty of bread and butter maybe it was just a bad night for nicole the server and the bar tenders first night there but when working in hospitality rolling your eyes and getting an attitude is not the best|decent petsmart location substandard service though i recently stopped in with my girlfriend and her mom to help them buy dog food and christmas hats for their dogs yes i know anyway this is the store where they normally purchase all that from the aisles are wellstocked although i didnt see any employees walking around or helping people anywhere after finding what we needed we headed up front to the registers it took the two gals working there a minute to decide which one they would open but eventually they did my girls mom tried to make small talk with the cashier and the girl totally blew her off and wouldnt say anything back i found that a bit rude when we left we realized she didnt add the coupon we gave her to the transaction this prompted my girl to freak out and try to go back inside to give the cashier a piece of her mind we convinced her it was too close to christmas for an epic public meltdown so she held off from doing what she wanted to do so to recap no employees working on any aisles rude cashiers who are inaccurate but good products allaround at petsmart stars and i think thats generous|i will not be returning the woman that helped me was very rude and lacked good customer service i hope other people have a better experience than i did giving  stars only because they had a decent selection of jewlery in their store but they seriously lack in customer service there are better jewelry stores in better areas |las vegas airportyou are an odd bird you are so easy you are so convenient so tempting with your slot machines and your panoramic views of the strip a harbinger of good times to come i wish that i could resist your allure but i cannot those flying machines that depart from your runways are just too much of a draw too fast too sleek too easy an alternative to driving over the rockies when i need to get to the inlaws in denver for christmas im sorry mccarran but on the outside i give you five stars but inside you just dont shake up to your peers your food offerings are mediocre at best your terminals are split if you are in t or  trying to get to three you are basically screwed your parking is expensive your security lines usually seem understaffed few pro tips

marias is known for their tamales and you can order them individually or by the dozen for take out as well they serve both the red beef and chicken green as well as the dessert pineapple raisin ones which i was never quite fond of pozole is similar to menudo minus the tripe it is a pork based soup or stew with hominy chiles garbanzo beans traditionally and other seasonings garnishes include cabbage or lettuce cabbage is better oregano radish cilantro avocado and lime juice most of the time i come here i get the pozole and a tamale or two their tacos are good  the avocado being one of my

seated next to the door to the bar  in and out in and out door opening and closing  andthe ice bucket for all of the tables near us was next to our table  crunch crunch crunch  so much for ambience the food  lovely  we had a filet mignon that was perfectly cooked  bearnaise sauce  could i get a bathtub full and soak in it  yum  my husband and i shared the meal  no extra charge for  salads and an extra side  our martinis were served with an extra carafe  making an equivalent of  drinks the meal ended with complimentary dessert  the waitstaff was very attentive  andall ladies get a rose|at this buffet you get what you pay for it reminded me of an upscale golden corral or ryans i actually enjoyed a lot of the food the prime rib dipped in the horseradish sauce the chicken wings and the cheese enchiladas were all very good the macaroni and stuffed pasta would have been good if it wasnt so cold decent dessert selection it was definitely not bad for the price|still one of the top  buffets in las vegas for valuemy favorites are the prime rib fried chicken collard greens  kulua pork and the pound cake the weekend champagne brunch is also a great value at under  tue night bbq is a stand out with beef ribs pork ribs and bbq chicken|the food was ok wont give it a higherbetter score service was good and very efficient prices seems to a bit pricy for what you get but i guess this is how it

during weekdays apparently part of mgm but not part of mlife|better than expected this was my first time staying here and from other yelp reviews and comments we heard from other people i was expecting a lot less the hotel is outdated but still reasonable we were on the west tower on the th floor facing the back end of the strip which had a nice view of the mountains if you are a family traveling with kids this is a good spot to head to because of all the entertainment they have for the children smell of smoke yes outdated casino yes you really do get what you pay for so if you want to spend more there are plenty of hotels to pick from in vegas checkin was a breeze we had three rooms and the lady that was with us was very accommodating and gave us rooms pretty much next to each other the valet was quick at times and slower at others but bearable the bell staff was pleasantly friendly checkout is where i would have my complain and almost thought about giving this place  stars instead of  one simple how was your stay would of made it a great checkout instead no questions asked about our stay and no conversation at all while waiting for our receipts to be printed not even a have a safe trip or thank you for staying with us on the way out|fast service and friendly staff not my number one place to go to for dinner but it was open and my kids are picky eaters|when you have the time to eat a hardy meal in an excellently decorated diner you would want to go to the claim jumper not only will the service by many employees satisfy your needs but the food comes in exceptional condition although the food is good the wait time is a minor problem so make sure you have nothing planned after the dinner because you might be late here is the time stamps i made while at this establishment desert not includedwait time to be seated  total appetizer time  total entre time    total check time  total   of waiting for everything to be done service rating  wait rating  total rating   |what a great find my partner and i were hungry and new in town i used yelp to find places nearby and this came up after reading the reviews we gave it a try once we arrived we were told there would be a fifteen minute wait as the kitchen was very busy this was ok and we sat down to wait once we got seated our waiter sam i think came to get our orders he was really knowledgeable about the menu and had a friendly smilewe ordered the calamari as an appetizer and a calzone and meatloaf as the entrees he brought our drinks and some bread the bread is a really great cheesy bread that is pretty good size the calzone was huge and really tasty my partner said the meatloaf was great i had ordered mushrooms with the calzone and they forgot them the manager came over and personally apologized for the mistake and gave us a price breakthat was really a good move we will surely go back for the great food and good service|the place suits its name   restaurant on one side classic nv video poker bar on the other  the menu is simple and has all the crowd favorites like burgers a ruben fish n chips steak and eggs  i got the steak and eggs and it was cooked to my order and came out piping hot servers were nice but did not hover|headed out of vegas looking for a family breakfast diner  saw this place on yelp to give it a try  it was just okay   the pancakes were not that good   the krustez at home tastes better  we were a little disappointed   the bacon tasted fake toojust not top notch in their quality of food|come for the food not for the service keep that mantra in mind and youll have a good timeif you havent tried cuban food before this is a great place to start for the uninitiated the tasting plate is your best choice both in value and variety you will get a little bit of everything their black beans and rice is very good although im not the hugest fan of cumin in cuban food their lechon asada was melt in your mouth good if you are looking for the old reliable of cuban food go with ropa vieja the shredded beef is delicious i would skip the yucca as it was cooked too long and became mushy it had a little bit of garlic but i love my yucca with a ton of garlic the tostones plaintain chips were decent however i prefer them crispierjust be prepared as the prices are a little bit on the higher side for the food entree plates are around  the service left plenty to be desired unfortunately our server arrived quickly to the table but then proceeded to disappear for at least  minutes after we asked for a few more minutes to decide our order it was hard to actually get our server at the table the water at the table was never refilled and plates hung out on the table for too long it was also a bummer that there was no live entertainment even though i believe saturday nights were supposed to have live entertainment the music they piped in got me dancing in my seat so that was a win the food is good service is slow so hang out take your time|holy guacamole or maybe holy beans and chips would be more appropriate they bring you that along with some salsa as soon as you sit down and boy its delicious no need to order dinner based of how much beans i ended up eating i highly suggest the guava margarita highly suggest  and its huge  their menus huge i knew i was gonna be full of chips so i ordered a taco and enchilada a la carte and the portion was perfect i have wanted to try this place for ages vegas locals always come here and it did not disappoint|been here a few times loved it until i got food poisoning the chimichanga and fried oreos had to have been cooked in old oil because that was all i could taste as i puked for a day and a half if you can manage to not have that experience this place is great|there is a vietnamese boy at this sushi joint at first i had the suspicious that hes vietnamese but kept on thinking he might be korean or japanese he looks kinda like kim hyun joong but kim hyun joong has plastic surgeon and  of korean actors have plastic surgeon he doesnt have plastic surgeon so i kept on thinking he must be vietnamese i finally asked if he is and he said yes but he doesnt know how to speak vietnamese mystery solved he doesnt seem as difficult or strict as the korean and japanese might be easy going to ask him then the others usually i dont dare to ask to much except to eat my food and pay hes young so will have less experience but im vietnamese i can handle inexperience than strict personality he looks like hes from da lat region em trai nhin thay yeu uoi nn uong sua pha voi bot calcium cho to con ln as for the food i live a block away so i have to come here for sushi everything is either prudent or bland here salad has a prudent ginger soy sauce with sesame oil sushi hand cut and all sushi roll have bland taste fish taste ok but from time to time the tuna is brown i stay away from it multiple times dipping sauce is only soy sauce  wasabi and no other sauce available high fresh quality might be given to kabotu i have the suspicious that sushimon is part of kabotu goyemon and monta ramen monta ramen is the noodle house and goyemon is the sister sushi house that will capture those that doesnt like or know sushimon sushimon on the westside is for those that are in the west but are a fan of sushimon kabotu is for those that willing to pay for the higher quality fish reserve for its priority goyemon might be the sister but both sushimon locations will always have a better quality of fish goyemon might is the rd standard so st kabotu nd sushimon and rd goyemon best dishes for the buck are the salmon dinner special and sashimi lunch special include rice  miso soup  salad  hand cuts or  hand rolls lunch special include miso soup  salad for  is not bad good price sushi at wasabi on eastern might be a little better but sushimons price is the best in this area nake sushi in summerlin on rampart x lake mead has a similar deal but its in the west side here in the southeast sushimon is the placethis is an ayce so be smart when you order or else wait order  at first then go down do not order  at a time because thats a long wait those that complained about the wait is because they do not go to ayce often or have lack of experience with ayce its like the rio buffet when its self serve its fast thats because you serve yourself but once you order something special like a sauce the waiter seems to disappear for a very long time|this place is pretty good for the most part ive been coming here for years and there definitely was a decrease in the quality of work when they switched owners they really dont seem to care when people complain because they do so much business im giving them  stars because they do good work most of the time they have a great color selection and i love the rockstar glitter it is on the expensive side and ive been trying to find new places but this is the best for the most part place ive found most of the time it is very good but sometimes it just isnt|this is a great place to eat although it is very busy   made reservations for a saturday night and arrived  minutes early   there was no way they could seat us early  as my guests dont drink the bar was not an option  so we sat  and sat  and satthe food and service was excellent   i would highly recommend anything at this restaurant as my guests were very satisfied   its an old style classy high end steakhouse   this will impact on your wallet but would may find it worth it|i enjoyed the coffee and the breakfast the first time you go its a little bit hectic and it might just be a little to trendy for me ill probably be back at some point but not in the near future the prices were fair it was super busy when we went but we didnt wait long for anything|this place is very rustic ok its a dump but the hotdogs are amazing which is why this place is a pittsburgh staple its all about the food the dogs have that snap and i always seem to gravitate towards the cheese dogs you also get a mountain of fries if you order them so prepared to carry a  pound brown bag of french fries|sushi is pretty good service is pretty slow but its almost ok because its a pretty fun environment lunch buffet is great almost impossible to call ahead to place a togo order because they will not answer phone|zumanity explores human sexuality in all of its forms from the romantic to the risque with a dash of naughty humor zumanity is a provocative exhibition of love and sensuality brought to life by a diverse spectrum of characters in an intimate cabaretstyle setting for adults onlyzumanity is new york new yorks resident show this is the sensual side of cirque there is nudity in the show so you really have to come in with an open mind and sense of humor the show starts off with a funny interaction with the audience if you dont want to be a part of it do not sit in like the first three rows from the stage me and my boyfriend were sitting in the first row of the mezzanine and we had a perfect eye level view the theatre is pretty intimate so i think even if youre in the balcony you can still see pretty goodthe performers were great i think my most favorite part was the two girls performing in a large wine glass filled with water but we enjoyed pretty much from beginning to endthis show is perfect for lovers honeymoon a date or if youre simply looking for something romantic to see|stayed in a dlevel penthouse suite the room itself was okay but we had trouble finding outlets that we could use the internet was terrible even using the inroom wifiwhen we arrived after a  hour drive that day our room was not ready the maid cart was parked in front of our room and the room itself was unfinished there was trash and dirty linens laying around and no toilet paper in the bathrooms our luggage bellhop said hed send somebody to help us but thirty minutes later we had not yet been helped one of stayed in the room while the other went to the deskbefore the person at the desk returned multiple maids stopped into the room and told us it was unfinished which of course wed already noticed meanwhile the one of us who was at the desk had to wait unusually long to be helped there was no line but there was also nobody even attending the desk finally after almost two hours the situation was sorted and we had to change rooms we were both exhausted from our drive and to not be able to relax for two hours after checking in because of some error or whatever definitely didnt make us happyonce we got to our final room things were fine would recommend making sure customer rooms are ready and work on better customer service better wifi and more accessible outlets would also help|came here for lunch on a sunday morning and my table of  was sat almost immediately on the heated patio theres a dark inner area inside patio area glass wallsroof and then an outside patio area with a generous amount of heat lamps and seats where you can people watch everyone on the strip while enjoying your meali got the croissant sandwich with turkey and avocado and the rest of my family got the salad eggs benedict and spinach omelette prices were relatively cheap considering this was a restaurant on the strip in a steakhouse and all food tasted not bad the portions were probably the perfect amount for lunch not too much but not too little given the great service and the ambiance of our meal i bumped a  star meal up to  stars this is a great place to have breakfast or lunch on the patio on a clear paradise morning |hmm i like the authentic feel of the setting and view of the bellagio fountain on the heated patio seals the deal  i commented that it does remind me of paris so there you goboar ragu was excellent so was the filet mignonescargots very tiny and not the best i have ever had but thats okay  we cant all be winnersservice slightly unattentive but overall a successful trip to this spot  good for date night |twice we ate at mon ami gabi a french restaurant located in the paris hotel  casino across from the bellagio both times we were fortunate to get frontrow seating outside on the terrace facing the famous las vegas stripservice was excellent and the prices were reasonable given its location brunch and lunch items were  to  each you can see the fountains of the bellagio while youre having dinner when you are seated you will be presented immediately with a warm delicious baguette with soft butter i ordered a glass of wine and a steak sandwich the service was excellent as was the food the waiters are really trying to make you have a great evening highly recommended|the service is very efficient the people are very kind and welcoming the food i real great and there is a wide variety to which suits everybody it has a very prime location right on the strip my only downside is that the  interior is very dark and the the restaurant is also slightly hard to find|just a kiosk store didnt have as much variety as expectedlike the napa location at least the line was not long though croissants are still really good discontinued the chocolate dipped macaroons whyyyyyyyyy|view is pretty good outside but still need to stand up to see the show unless you are one of four two person tables at the edge a good place for a pic though food is expensive and mediocre probably better just to watch the fountain show out in the front|i have been meaning to come here ever since i saw it on the best thing i ever ate  after years of being bookmarked in my mind i finally stumbled in during the wee hours of the night for their gamblers specialthe gamblers special is an unadvertised plate of steak grilled shrimp mashed potatoes and veggies for   you have to have the hard rock hotels backstage pass players card and also purchase a beverage in order to get the special but its a good dealthe steak was cooked medium just as i asked and it was good enough for a  steak  i really liked the shrimp they were a good size and seasoned well the mashed potatoes were creamy and delicious toomy friends and i enjoyed the food so much that we came back again the next night  the second time we shared the fire roasted nachos  with chicken  and good thing we shared because it was huge they were good nachos and the cheese stayed melty which i lovemr luckys is open  so its very convenient and they have many different specials depending on the day and time  make sure to get the players card because you get discounts on most of the food on the menu with it|love the selection of beers and bartenders food is typical bar food but always comes out fresh and hot|unexpectedly turned out to be a pretty good experience we got a couple of things minestrone soup and a custom made pasta  vodka sauce with gluten free pasta and vegetables the soup was good nothing special but the pasta was excellent the sauce had a nice burnt flavor to it the gluten free option was great and felt lighter vegetables were very nicely done|this is my nd time visiting mystere show  ticket vouchers were purchased at discounted price from ticketstonight booth for  per person   then we went to mystere box office to exchange our vouchers for actual ticketd surprised we got pretty good seats too  the performance and music were good  i just felt that they had reduce the number of acts and performers compared to the past  show started at pm and ended before pm|i go to vegas pretty regularly and i would say this night club has a really bad set up the dance floor is small and the tables are far away from the stage you also have to walk up like two or three flights of stairs just to get to the night club the club is inside of the restaurant so you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the club the awesome promoters are the only thing driving this club shout out to cash daddy aka chris cash for taking care of us and making sure we had a good time the cocktail waitresses were also really good at making sure we had drinks and making the drinks we saw tritonal that night and i love tritonal but they were not that great partially because i dont think the sound system is the best|we had a really nice lunch here the other day the restaurant reminds me a lot of a cheecake factory there were so many delicious sounding things on the menu that it was hard to order we ordered the buffalo bites as an appetizer and really enjoyed them i went with the asian nachos because where else are you going to get asian nachos they were odd but good i would probably not order them again but im glad i tried them my moms chicken quesadilla was very good everyone else enjoyed their food as well portions were big and prices were decent i would definitely come back here if i am ever in the area|amazing but except for this one bihy lady i asked her for a cup of water and she replied for what in a rude i never got laid in my life manner like im going to use that cup of water to get her wet jokes aside i would recommend you bringing your own milk or an empty cup to get milk from their coffee station also  stars only because it would be so much greater warm|i went here because there had been a huge line at buffet  i was suppose to get a buffet with my stay but that never happen because i had wasnt interested in standing in line for two hours  my seat had not been by the window but if you do you get great view of the pool  service was just ok  hard to get a refill from waitress  there appeared to be a bus person who had been suppose to help the waitress but when i asked him if i could get a refill he told me he was not sure and it was his first day  my sweetheart and i both had a sandwich  they were ok nothing great and nothing bad   they were both served on a cool looking wood board but it was still just ok  we arrived just after  am  we were given lunch menus  i would have expected that people next to me who sat down after me were able to order breakfast item with the same waitress  no breakfast items were on the lunch menu so im not sure what was with that   the breakfast items i saw looked very good|beautiful cirque show at the wynn  the theater is a circular seating arrangement so really no bad seat in the house   if you know anyone who lives in vegas they usually have a locals discount where they just need to show id to purchase the tickets  they have some last minute options or hotel packages as well    we stayed away from the splash zone which is the first couple rows  these seats are cheaper but read other reviews so stayed away although it did not appear that they got that wet   we were in awe of each performer the acrobatics the stage transformations the fire the water displays even had a few comedic actseverything was just entertaining  the show is about  minutes long and the rows are pretty tight so once you are sitting down expect to sit for the entire show  the theater is pretty warm since they need to keep the performers comfortable so dont need a jacket or coat or just be prepared to take it off    beautiful show|quality is down ate here many times but this probably our last desert was skimp with many from premade not fresh salad was barely minimum sushi only cali and tuna rolls  for dinner on wednesday|what happened to the extra shot of tequilla in your margarita  they used to serve the extra shot in a test tube  that was unique  now it is just like senor frogs and both sell yards bogo for |everyone loves this show but i found it to be just okay i didnt find the men to be that attractive they all looked older than what i was expecting at one point during the risky business part one of the performers hugged me and whispered in my ear thanks for coming sweetie  which i didnt find to be sexy at all but maybe it just wasnt for me|we had gone to the one in new york and could not pass this one up while we were here in vegas the hot pastrami on rye is the best ever|the food was very good i felt bad for the girls there were only two of them for  tables full and people want to be seated the beef pho was one of the best i have had in town the veggie spring roll was ok will be back soon|love this place the menu has everything you could possibly crave my boyfriend and i visit about  times a month i love everything i order the service varies here we usually have josh help us hes very good and always takes care of us the food is always great and fresh|great place for the kids kids liked it a lot you need to get a spot close to the front though for a good view|we went to vegas for a family get together  kids  yr and wanted to find a family friendly show that didnt break the bank  believe it or not there arent many options  i came across this show and didnt know what to expect  we found a great deal on groupon around  for ga and  for kids  i debated paying extra for the vip reserved seats  but didnt we arrived at pm for the pm show and found quite a line at the theater  i was a tad nervous since our tickets were ga  but then i realized that people there were lining up to pick up tickets to other shows  when i got to the front they asked if i wanted to pay  per ticket extra to upgrade to the vip section assigned seats  i declined again and am very glad that i did  by the time we entered the theater it was around pm and all of the people waited had already entered  we were seated about  rows back on the side  we could see pretty well except for the side  but all in all great viewthe show was great for kids  good mix of animals comedy and circus act  the kids were entertained throughout and the show really didnt drag mins was perfect  i think the show for its value was on point  i didnt have any expectations so i was not disappointedtip  the theater is in the back of the mall  do not valet at the casinohotel would be a long walk  park in the structure|talk about a popular dim sum place my family has loved this restaurant for a few years but this was my first time trying it so i was excited we tried to get here by am so we could get in for the first seating at  but unfortunately we missed it so needed to wait  min or so as groups started to leave and there continued to be a long line haha im impressed by the efficient designthe tables are arranged in a circle so that carts can go around to the tables and then replenish at the kitchen unfortunately since we were at the beginning of the second seating there werent many items we often like chicken feet har gao siu mai since they ran out fortunately we got them as we were finishing upi really enjoyed something that seemed like shrimp tempura wrapped in funn it was delicious i also liked the eggplant shrimp generous amount of shrimp inside and roast pork i also love gailan and i appreciated that the sauce was on the side so i could control how salty i wanted itthe baked char siu bao couldve been softer though and filled with more meat the butter buns were filled with lots of butter though they could have been warmer and softerthe service was generally good and some of the servers even smiled if youre family with dim sum restaurants you know thats rarei enjoyed ping pang pong and would return again most of the customers were chinese and other asian so you know the experience is really chinese|went for brians birthday  food was twisted as promised  couldnt finish brian jr had the pancake  about a foot across i had the meatloaf with potatoes spinach and cheese really good service quick especially on a thursday  always safe to go good food  good not excellent  i think the draw is the size and weirdness of presentation|oh zen  after walking by this place every day for the last few months i finally made it in for dinner  there are a couple of great things that this place has going onthe decor is pretty coolmodern bar and nice outdoor spaceincredibly friendly staffalways great when everyone you encounter is smiling and nicelocation is convenientright off east blvd in a busy part of dilworthdiverse menuasian and spanish which is an odd combo but surprisingly worksyet the food was just ok  i really didnt love the flavor of my thai basil chicken dish  they could have gone a little heavier on the spices to make it a bit more flavorful  the mojito i had was also not well balanced and i had about three drinks until i gave up  the kung pow chicken was pretty good thoughzen consider this a first date  i see the potential so i promise ill give you another chance and we will meet again|ok so this is a late review yall love this place sure olives from all four corners of the world  but yuppie cheese at the deli counter umm yes i was so high maintenance way back in june  when i was trying to act like i knew my way around such things the gal  i never got her name  was no helpful real sleepy though  kept yawning but i snapped her out of that with my plucky yet clueless customer visit that day|they have the best indian snacks and fast food in town periodi would give them a five except for the fact that the place is too small with very less seating most often very crowded and the front desk person is not very friendlyasking the front desk person any question results in a barrage of defensive statements and this has been verified by other people as well through hearsay and observed interactionsoverall this is a good place if you do not look for a decent place to sit and eat as well as do not want to talk about anything to the front desk man i would have still given them a  star if the front desk customer service was better|best bang for your buck  the food was good not the best but also not freak bad they had all your go to type buffet food the ice cream and gelato were legit better than paying  to  bucks to eat buffet on the strip this place had good service and good variety  came here with a friend of mine after we had our morning workout came here for thr gains and had a buy  get  free coupon would come here again  soon ciao fatties|awesome staff they know how to make every vacation worthwhile this is the rd time we have stayed on property and on both occasdions vallet seems to look over hotel guests all the timethey keep on messing up our luggage and make us wait for more than  minutes and assisted the car behind us however once we got to the gold lounge everything went from zero to a perfecrt  i just hope the bell staff would atleast take care of guests properly i would have rated them a   star but lost one due to their awful bellstaff|we went there with a friend to have some desserts tried couple of them as well as an appetizer finger food  curried potatoesall the food was very good the service was timely and good i can imagine that it can get a little more crowdythis is a real nice place to hang out in tempe and i will try their menu items soon in the future|quite honestly it was the best bi bim bap i ever had and im a pretty well sort out in bi bim bap rice meat veg egg sauce simple right the selection on the veg and quality of the meat varies from place to place the bi bim bop here is well balanced and has a lettuce added to the top at first i thought it was weird but after stirring  it up in the stone pot which is a must for a quality bap it works as i write this review i kind of want to go back for another and at  bucks for a bi bim bop its quite expensive as the dish goes but i suppose you get what you pay for|the doritos locos taco is very overhyped i am sad to say  i was very excited after seeing commercials as i am a big doritos fan and hoped they would do a cool ranch one and then they did  sadly it is not as dreamy as i thought it would be |craved for oxtail soup around am market cafe is usually where i go whenever i want a large portion of oxtail soup thats super meaty however as always there was a long night on a tuesday at am did not have the patience to wait decided to yelp  found this place perfecto short line and express service got our food and finished it within  minutes ordered oxtail soup it was just as meaty as market cafe however the broth was a little more salty but no problem eat it with rice and it will balance out also tried the loco moco not a fan it was salty i wanted spam musubi but they didnt have so we opt for the loco moco i enjoyed the oxtail soup though and prob would be coming back if i ever crave oxtail soup again|this is my favorite dim sum restaurant in the valley if you come on a sunday during prime time youll get the freshest food largest selection and best service there are carts being wheeled nonstop between the tables it makes for a fun outing with family and friends if youre adventurous you may want to try authentic dishes like chicken feet if not there are plenty of dumpling and noodle options and sweets too its not as robust as dim sum in san francisco chinatown but it fully satisfies my craving for dim sum just dont show up after pm because youll only have leftovers to choose from  they stop adding to the carts once the crowd dies off|i had an overall pretty good experience here the only reason its  stars instead of  is because the front desk staff really is quite rude one of them was sitting on the phone talking to a friend directly in the front window its unfortunate because the front desk staff is the face of the company and they make it seem like it will be an unpleasant experience the nurse was super sweet and genuinely wanted to help same with the pa i had to have blood work done and the lab test lady was super fast nice and made it so i barely felt it i will definitely be returning to this office|this location is not stingy with the portions the staff is very quick and some what friendly i cant complain its fast food and they need you to get your stuff and go now if you plan on being snobby just dont please be nice to your servers and you just might get the same in return it does seem darker in the seating area inside so if the weather is great enjoy your meal outside fyi i did not get e coli|if u want a quick good burritothis is the place to go they make it so fast their portion is very good as well could only finish half of my burrito so saving the other half for later also the staffs are pretty friendly so thats a plus|great gas prices and rarely are they busy the inside of the circle k is a bit dated but they carry all the typical convenience store essentials staff is always friendly here which is always pleasant|i tried the cream puff pretty good to much cream and i think it could have been a little sweeter everything here looked so delicious my pocketbook though cant quite wrap around the high prices for everything i will return though when i have some extra money for goodies|tech was very nice love the results only  for a full set would of given it  stars but the environment wasnt very comfortable employees yelling and speaking a different language very loud but overall awesome|sad i have to take some stars away  cathy no longer works here  although the lady i got today worked hard to remove the terrible gel mani i got elsewhere she was very rough with my hands  my nails are very delicate and she was treating them like i had fake acrylics on  i got hurt at least  times  also she applied the color so far from the cuticle that it looks like my nails are already grown out  i didnt notice until i got in my car and i honestly didnt want to go back and sit there for another  minutes  i havent completely given up on this place  i will just have to try going to someone else like the owner  her work ive seen on here looks amazing|the service was on point  i will say the best things to eat here is the steak stuffed mushrooms and key lime pie  i came here with a party of four and we ordered a lot of food  the stone crabs were our app which werent worth the money paid for  but im from maryland were we eat crabs all the time and its hard to convince me that a place outside of the maryland area really has some good crabs or not  we also had asparagus but those were the worst asparagus ive ever had  the didnt even seem completely green either like true asparagus  the creamed spinach was the worst  not sure how they mess up on that   the mash potatos were ok but i had better at outback  we also has the apple keylime and banana pie  all of them were basic except the keylime which was good  over all i dont see me coming back to this place and its over rated  if you want good crabs in vegas go to the super market and order you some  or go spend your money at the caesar buffet which is well worth the money|an entertaining way to spend an hour definitely more adult orientedthe children on our tour all looked quite bored the tour guides are all knowledgeable and passionate about what they do|my mom lives in san jose ca where there are dozens banh mi places clustered together battling it out for banh mi supremacy well actually they are just battling it out for survival since the competition is so fiercewe only had two banh mis here the grilled pork and house special but the two sandwiches right up there with the ones from san jose the baguette could have been a bit crunchier on the outside but other than that these were delicious the meats were grilled just right the vegetables were pickled just right and the friendly man at the counter offered to put any of the condiments on the side jalapeno cilantro etc i think they did something with the mayo sauce that gave the sandwiches a little extra flavor boost but i couldnt be sure anyway if you have a craving for banh mi and dont feel like flying down to san jose drop by|had a great time the  minute tour on the dune buggies was plenty for me in my opinion its a tiny bit over priced though was scared to book bc of other reviews that i saw but my personal experience was great pick up was  min late but he called to let us know and was such a nice guy seems like the place may need better management but still happy i decided to give this a try it was worth it|great food great drinks service not so muchcame here for happy hour one time with a co worker on a friday once youre able to flag down the waitstaff your experience will be great had the potato skins and a dirty martini their martinis are  on fridays but made with well liquor still really good nice portions for the food and strong drinks definitely worth the money i will be back i just hope i dont have to wait  minutes for service|food is ok and not terribly overpriced for a airport in vegas at that service was great good margaritas but the music maybe it was because of the time of day we were here just before am but they had s hits being poorly covered and not just one or two bad covers all of them were horrible give me mexican music at a mexican restaurant or if youre going to play s hits get the original|to start our service was phenomenal we are from out of town and he took us through the whole menu gave recommendations on what to do around town and always had our drinks filled the enchilada was very good with shredded chicken and christmas style sauces the spanish rice was decent not terrible the smashed pinto beans however were insanely good i did not like the seasoning on the chips and didnt like that you only got one refill on chips even though we had  people in our party also didnt like that the salsa wasnt refillable at allcost per bowl after the initial serving|working down my list of places i drive by all the time and should stop by their holiday toy drive finally drove me here i was happy to see an overflowing bin of toys and i also signed up for their players club its a local bar and a poker bar they are somehow aligned with the  distill locations but have separate players cards the bartender was helpful in getting me signed up and the bar wasnt smoky so far so goodthere was some bonus play for signing up i think  for earning  points i walked away a winner so im a fan the atmosphere is slightly upscalish and the dining room is separate from the bar i didnt have the time to try their food but would like to so hopefully i wont drive by another  times without stopping again|i enjoy the taste of their chicken sandwiches but honestly this is the most expensive chicken sandwich in the fast food industry and the buns and chicken breasts have seemed to shrink significantly over the last  or  years the service is always top notch|there was a line to get in which was a good sign we started with calamari which was excellent my husband truly enjoyed his linguine with red clam sauce the focaccia bread was basically a couple wedges of broiled pita i had a pepperoni calzone and was very disappointed the dough was very good but thats what most of it was  dough very little filling and it was if it had been thrown together and baked til the dough was crispy the ricotta wasnt warm once i found it my prosecco was very good we shared a cannoli husband liked it but i wasnt impressed the shell was almost perfect but the filling was average with a very runny consistency prices are decent although the linguine portion seemed small to me service was quick and very good|the burgers are great and i love the downtown chandler feel  during rush hour times though inside the restaurant gets very loud|had a great time there definitely recommend it the bbq plate was great fish and chips were awesome great beer selection|wasnt too impressed with this buffet we went because we had the  coupons but even with that it wasnt really worth it|visited here during a recent vacation the monument is impressive and the adjacent museum for five dollars is worth a visit also enjoyed the  minute video explaining the areas history confused by the large number of pigeons resting within the monumentbe wary of where you step|great food check out their happy hour the street tacos and chicken quesadilla is soo good our waiter sucked sonja had to flag her down every time never checked on us|i absolutely love cajun food and this place did not disapoint  very nice looking restuarant and the wait staff was really friendly  food prices were reasonable|the staff is very friendly we love david and yvette they are the best no really i work in the hospitality industry and this place is where you need to go dont miss out on the best place in vegas|the review was good and thats why we visited but completely disappointed there was a single waiter that day and i dont know how he was managing but most of the food came quite late and some items were not warm if not cold to ask for an additional item was difficult since the guy will be back only after min the platter i liked and its a must try if it is warm|my favorite yard house in town not only im a fan of their happy hour but the staffs here are welcoming and friendly shouts out to derick and jennifer whenever i come here with my boyfriend and family i always ask for them they would come to our tables to check up on us and ask if we need anything even if they were busy|i was pleasantly surprised with my experience here delicious food that is very casual and laid back|i was in the area with a large group of family for lunch and this was the only place that could accommodate such a large group from these reviews i had very low expectations however it wasnt as bad as i had feared for one thing the porch where we sat was really nice it is pretty and has heaters and a pretty electric fireplace which is nice our waiter was also great the food was definitely over priced but not awful  i expected it to be so horrible from the reviews that i just ordered fries and coffee but from seeing everyone elses food it definitely didnt look horrible the burgers were cooked medium rare exactly as ordered they werent anything special but definitely not awful it was weird because they were out of prime rib and it was only noon so im not sure how that happenedoverall we were pleased because  of us could sit and talk and all hear each other and sit in a pretty place the food was overpriced but not offensive|my friend from vegas raved raising canes and we went there after having a couple of drinks id say its good drunk food hungover food or cheat day foodthe menu is mainly made up of fried chicken fingers french fries and breaded fried chicken sandwiches i wish they had some vegetable options my vegetarian friend was extremely unhappy here hahaits fine to try but i wouldnt seek it out|was a little disappointed in the pastries i got i visited this place several years back when it was in a much smaller location and thought it was better then maybe it feels too commercialized now the almond croissant was fine nothing special it wasnt warmed either and had way too much almond paste in the middle the macron was cold and hard not soft and delectable i couldnt even finish it and thats not a good sign the coffee was fine also nothing special dashing my expectation for a delicious cup of french coffee went back the next day to try a few more things the elephant ears had no taste the tea cake was good honestly had hoped for more when i walked in given my past experience it went from quaint good french bakery to giant just ok french bakery|great service excellent hot wings and their thin slices are fantastic my only complaint would be the sicilian slice the bottom was hard as a rock|my girlfriend and her mother brought me here for dessert one afternoon after stopping by the new casino nearby out server nadia was excellent she was friendly took orders quickly and brought us refills of our drinks periodically the restaurant itself was crowded but ordered and managed well by the staff this is what set bjs apart from other restaurants in my mind they handled the chaos without becoming rude or having visible difficulties overall my dessert was spectacular i had the double chocolate cookie with ghirardellis chocolate ice cream and the service was great i wouldnt hesitate to come back to this bjs location stars|this restaurant is a favorite in our family usually we order in but when we go to the restaurant its even better even before the meal you get a plate of bruschetta ours was slightly burned but they offered us a new one free of charge the new one was great the dcor gives the place a nice italian feel there were many choices on the menu and we decided on fettuccine with pesto manicotti and spaghetti with meat sauce this was a bit much for a party of one adult and three kids the pesto was a bit bland but the spaghetti with meat sauce was really tasty we even considered buying some of the sauce the manicotti was great all in all an amazing authentic pasta place|for what it is its quite expensive  i paid about  for a small soup and a very tiny amount of a vegan pie nah|my boyfriend and i order from this place all the time we usually order the exact same thing butter chicken lamb curry and eggplant sometimes the food is good but lately the quality is hit or miss we ordered those three dishes last night and were extremely disappointed it was the last time we will be ordering from this joint|i went there in a saturday night and the place was half full but still chill with calm musicthe waiter was willing to answer our questions about the food and all one of them i believe is the owner he was very friendly and even told us a little about his historywe ordered the table dhte for  with two starters  main dishes  desserts and coffeetee at the endwe started with soups both tasty especially mine made with blue cheese only thing i think there could be some breadthe main dishes were momos a typical gyozastyle tibetan dish it was deliciousthe desserts were good too mine was a little small just a little indian candy ball covered with syrup stay with the chocolate cake if you want to stuff yourself with dessert we had a great experience there i totally recommend|solid place to meet with friends for drinks went there in the afternoon when it wasnt very busy they had a decent selection of beer on tap and they serve pitchers i also noticed a pool table i wouldnt say its anything special  for better or worse simpatico|i find this place to offer the best vietnamese food in montreal of its kind the menu offers a wide variety of choices and at quite reasonable prices we find it offers the best value to its clients that one could find in its class i believe it deserves a  rating the decor is quite plain but clean and quite spacious i recommend you try this hidden little gem|trs bonne qualit audiovideo cinma trs  confortable je reproche juste le manque de visibilit des sallesbeaucoup de tches sur les lunettes d|i love indian food and this is the only place we go the place is small but when you get in you can really feel an authentic atmosphere usually as two people we ordered just some naan bread a tub of butter chicken and mixed vegetable bhaji the butter chicken is creamy spicy and amazing the naan bread is just a little bit sweet perfect to dip in the butter chicken sauce and the vegetable bhaji are the perfect appetizer to top it all off great place |sterlings is one of my favourite restaurants they food here is pretty good mash potatoes here are really tasty   the decor inside is to my liking but the lighting is a little dark the prices are a little expensive but i think it is worth it|the food here is decent i love the coffee and breakfast here probably the best things on the menu|oh my gosh so much fun tons of music selections and perfect for big groups bring the family or come with friends check it out the parking is tough as there are many businesses here but worth the wait|having just moved to madison from la i am seeking cool spots with vegan options alchemy had been recommended to me a number of times so a friend and i checked it out on a recent tuesday the atmosphere was great and the host and waiter were both friendly and helpful i loved the layout of the elevated seating levels it was packed for a tuesday probably because of the holiday just a few days away the spirit menu had some fun options and the ginginger beer cocktail i had was delicious and well mixed as for the fare it looked like the menu had one salad one entree maybe a soup and four sides for me to choose from okay not outstanding at first but then i saw that i could substitute any burger with a tofu walnut burger for a vegan version of any of the three burgers that made me very excited the waiter assured me that the cook would prepare a delicious applerum burger veganstyle i opted for housemade alchemy fries and asked for a side of pickles too when the food arrived my friends regular applerum burger was dripping with scrumptious toppings mine on the other hand looked less than appetizing just a tofu walnut burger on toasted bread i think sourdough lettuce and tomato the cheese aioli and sweet onion rum relish had to removed with apparently nothing else interesting to possibly replace them the relish contains anchovies apparently the walnut burger was one of the better substitute burgers ive had in madison but there were walnut shells in the burgeroops almost cracked a tooth on those alchemy the fries were outstanding i couldnt get enough and though i had to ask twice for the pickles they were worth the wait made to perfection inhouse they were equally delightful on their own or on my sandwichoverall i dont fault alchemy for having trouble coming up with interesting things to do with vegan renditions hence the  stars for great atmosphere yummy drinks dope fries and pickles and professional staff however it was a disappointment to have zero condiments offered to me for my burger there must be something in that kitchen to spice it up ill definitely be back maybe the curry will be a vegan winner otherwise ill just eat before i get there|this was my first visit took spicy japanese noodles it was tasty but not completely cooked hard to chew not sure if its the nature of japanese noodles|i came here for an early lunch one day my waitress was super friendly ordered a martini and it was great kudos to the bartender i ordered chicken parmigiana would love to explore more of the menu my friend told me that they sell items that arent listed on the menu like philly cheesesteaks as a first time customer i wish i wouldve been advised of this secret menu i will return though|i was a little scared because of all the bad reviews but my friend recommended and i loved my nails  pauline is very good and she listen to what you want  ivied how my nails turned out coffin shape recommend|small little shop with a warm and welcoming ambience  one of my top favorites for brunch for  pesto chicken and sherleys gone bananas being my family favorites|the inside is absolutely beautiful and their milkshakes are delicious i just wish i could get here more often|i was really pleased to discover that my new house was near a swimming pool i like to swim fairly regularly but previously have not lived walking distance from a pool so im really grateful that this is just round the corner as during the cold winter months it was too easy to put off the cycle to the pool for another night now since its not such an effort to get to the pool itself ill be going far more often i have been here for a swim several times now  i really like it im used to modern build pools or super sporty swimming centres but with a restored victorian pool glenogle swim centre is the first pool of its kind ive visited i like the nostalgia that comes with itservice is friendly the pool is always immaculately clean and the premises are safe with several staff members on site the staff at the front desk are always really friendly too which makes all the difference on a miserable winter night  im impressed with my new local pool|a little bit louder than i would have liked but they have pretty good tea with free refills and free wifi that is excellent quality|were here for a basketball game and had a suite provided by an employee  food and drink and an enjoyable game to watch  the games at the kohl center are always a blast  the service in the suite was excellent|my favorite place to get hawaiian food in vegas a must try is their chicken katsu loco moco over fried rice the portion is huge i think it would feed me for  meals their poke is good im sure everything on the menu is yummy but make sure to save room for dessert|we booked the aria through mgm packages we wanted a room with a view of the strip and paid extra for that when we arrived we had a letter on the table that stated for privacy keep your drapes closed due to window cleaningwe called the front desk to see where we could get breakfast at am due to an early tour departure we were told nothing was open the air conditioning system was not maintained and kept blowing dust all over thats my first and last stay there|having a good lunch today  food was great as always  but if you want bread andor crackers you better ask early   and ask often  each offering is  pieces  service was ok today  usually better and the reason for the discounted review|parking here sucks so arrive early if you want the pm  board and wine special customer service is okay because they do get a bit busy this was my first time at this location and my server was not the best at the beginning as we waited about mins just to put in an appetizer after that everything else went find and the food is always good here bruschetta and their house moscato are my best friends so im always happy when i get my food i would encourage you to try their seasonal bruschetta its a hit or miss but its worth trying|i wasnt quite sure what to expect when my girlfriend suggested we go here when another nearby restaurant was unavailable i was pleasantly surprisedat first i thought my fears were realized when i saw the rather simple small menu boy was i wrong  this place is a prime example of how maintaining a tight focus yields great results oh and they have a great beer and wine selection|this place screams tourist trap luckily its delicious the decor is cute as can be the food and drinks are very overpriced though my mom joked that her pepsi was probably  dollars turns out it was  lol my sister and i split the lookie lookie gimme cookie and it was phenomenal worth all  dollars the three cookies that were in it were all delicious the cookie dough icecream was great and full of cookie dough we couldnt even finish it all i would suggest maybe doing lunch or dinner elsewhere and splitting a dessert here based on the high prices|a much better improvement compared to last yearamazing service the greeter was very friendly and seated us super quickly the waiter was very helpful in offering us the best selection in desserts and snacks we ordered the frozen hot chocolate for two the deep fried oreo cookies and cream sundae and the sweet potato fries all were delicious and i would totally recommend them total came to  would definitely come back again loved it|have been here multiple times it was much better a few months ago went here the other day and service was really slow even though it was not busy we got our drinksfood at the same time there were many vegetables in the dish either the lunch dishes are much smaller|feeling like a burrito fix or craving anything off a bertos type menu  senior taco is your place if your in the area  consistency huge portions and affordable prices have made senior taco a stand out amongst fillibertos and other berto type joints  my wife is a vegetarian and can always order custom burritos her go to is egg potato cheese and guacamole  i went with the asada nachos which is a monster portion could easily feed  people  dont forget the caramel filled churro best enjoyed hot|this place happy hour is amazing and try the kielbasa and chz add a egg omfg it was amazing this city is a foodie so with this place i say share all food|one of the better pizzas around easily top  in phoenix and arguably top  not as good as biancos though been there twice for lunch and the service was horrendously slow from being seated to getting our food was about an hour doesnt exactly make you want to come back when you only have a short time for lunch during the workweek its not like biancos where you know you have to wait  hour to get a table we were seated immediatelyand then our waiter disappeared but the pizza will not disappoint also had the short rib sandwich which was quite delicious  next time i must ask for no jalapeno because it was covered in them and so spicy on the tongue that it didnt balance well with the very tender meat and the flavours i knew were there but could not savor great pizza beautiful restaurant poor service  recommended to pizza snobs who have time to take an extra long lunch  i will return then when its more convenient|a strong  stars friendly service and a decent atmosphere though we were sat right next to the guy playing guitar on stage so our evening had a lot whatyelpers who state this place has the best pad thai in vegas make a solid argument|yes im a fan  you can throw a rock and hit a sushi restaurant anywhere in gilbert but i have to say i like this place the best attentive staff great food and cheap i opted for the bulgoki beef and a couple of rolls tonight the beef is so good after i got mine other people ordered it at my table  the stuffed jalapenos are freeking awesome too great job well always be back|i definitely wanted to try a buffet while in vegas and this one was decent priced but not insane like a couple other huge vegas buffets holiday pricing was in effect so that was a little surprise we went at brunch and had a little wait to be seated the  hour stay restriction is enough to sit and digest after eating some dishes were cold by the time i stated stuffing my face corned beef hash was not good tons of variety i was excited to see curry and naan and it was very good i was not impressed with the asian food gelato was very good i was full by the end but nothing too special i will try another famous buffet when i in vegas next|good gym it has all the equipment you need and is usually not super crowded i wish it was  hours but the hours are not terrible|go hungry and leave full really good quality of fish and artistic rolls they have a baja habernera  roll that surpassed my expectations they are korean owned operated japanese sushi house they have japanese art decor but played korean music good sushi|good service and food i stopped in recently for a late lunch with a friend and to watch the game i took a seat near the tvs and there was hardly anyone there my server was a sweetheart checking up on me quite frequently and making sure i had refills of my drink when my friend arrived we placed our orders their happy hour menu was a bit confusing because it didnt differentiate between the regular menu portions and the special happy hour portions when we asked we were told that the chicken strips would be less minus a strip everything was fine until we got our bill because i ordered fries they went ahead and charged me full price for the strips i was unaware that ordering fries would void any happy hour deal from them so that was a bit of a letdown considering the service was so good in the end i would still come back but i would make sure that i am completely clear about what i can change with their happy hour menu before i place that order|i really liked the food and environment here and the servers were extremely nice the only problem was that i order shrimp curry but there turned out to be chicken in it|the foods always good but this is slowest moving drive thru ive ever been thru its never a quick trip if you go thru the drive thru here ive ordered and have been in the drive thru for ten min and im not even close to the window on a positive note they have never gotten my order wrong and its always clean when you go inside|three of us got the  massage for the hour didnt realize it was most of the body they would do i am a physical therapist and can tell you that they know where all the spots are located and did a great job first time for hot rocks and wow they were hot we were surprised by the obligated  tip but they were worth it|food was really good i ordered the puffy tacos i ordered a margarita and i swear it was the strongest margarita ever it took awhile to get our food but the server was great he made sure our drinks stayed full id definitely go back again|no where close to ny pizza i am not sure if i would go back i also placed an order and went to pick it up and i still had to wait another  mins the garlicknots are amazing though|i like this casino its in the desert but its relaxing im from az n i grew up here hotel is clean and comfy place many promos at the casino n poker tables|im a big guyand i love healthy portions of food  well this place does not disapoint  the burritos are so good  i think i downed like  of them  the staff was very friendly and the place is really clean  i just wish they would give you a bigger portion of mexican rice|this place has a friendly staff and pretty good food  i definitely will be back and will recommend it to friends|decided to check this place out since i was in the area super busy but was seated right away at the bar i ordered the el guac burger it was delicious made exactly how i ordered it it came with fresh cut fries too very tasty i ordered it medium and the flavor was really good jon was our waiter very nice and let me taste some beers before i decided on four peaks kolsch i would have given them five stars if it were not for the disgusting bathroom|i bring my sons  daughter here on a regular basis its a fun place for the kids the only reason i wouldnt give it  stars is that you have to keep a close eye on your kids when the clippers come out our boys have had their hair above their ears sideburns shorn a little too close|the chef used the wrong kind of corn which made the soup a little sweet also they added two much oil to every dish|came here to paint christmas ornaments with my son i think i enjoyed the activity more than my son did i would love to come back for a ladies night event its also a great way to spend some quality time with the kiddos i just wish it didnt take a week to get items back|a chain tanning bed salon bulbs arent always up to par and their lotion prices are astronomical but the one advantage  its a chain and i can tan at any affiliation across the country and i havewa nc fl without any hassle each location is set up a little different from the rest but they are consistent with the typelevel of beds ensuring im using the package i paid for|good food and great customer service when ever i come here close to my house and convenient parking  my go to place for mexican food|whoaso i went all the way out and split the man vs food dish with a friend  delish and this is coming from someone who doesnt like biscuits gravy or mash potatoes lolllelectric blue drink was really good as well and a great valuekind if a shocker that i only needed one  defeated comes to mindoriginally i thought it was a nice sit down place  but its your average chain restaurantdiner feel however the staff was attentive and friendly service with a smile|really tasty meatball sliders with fries  happy hour   craft beer also at happy hour very reasonable food  drink prices and high quality as well the atmosphere is cozy and the tables in the back where our group was are surfboards on the downside a few people were waiting for their checks and i dont think we wouldve got them without asking i was here for a holiday party about  people and maybe they needed more servers id say this place has great potential if they could up the service a few notches|this chipotle got most of my expendable income while i was studying at asu across the street many afternoons and evenings were spent there usually after long days in the library or the political science building anyway the service and food have never dropped off i recently stopped back in to see how the food is in  to my surprise it was still good and the service was also very friendly and nice i got there for an early lunch at  am about  minutes later the local corporate tempe community started forming quite a line that line never subsided while i was there and the parking lot which is rather limited was full and cars began parking on the nearest residential street that is still a problem here if you come with a vehicle at lunch time thats really the only negative about this place the fact that they are so busy during lunch with so many options just down the street tells me a lot about how good the food and service is at this location indeed memory lane at this chipotle was nice and the burrito was even better id stop back in again when i am in the tempe area|everyone that works here is super friendly and nice my only complaint is its kind of dirty the play area especially  the floor is filthy and and equipment is disgusting i really enjoy coming here and watching kids play but it really needs to be cleaned and rules need to be enforced|cosmo totally delivered our room was spotless and loaded with nice furniture but the real highlight was the balcony we had a glam view of the bellagio fountains and the paris eiffel tower which was amazing for the insta picsi had a vision and it was everything i wanted it to be lol we ordered more towels blankets toothbrushes and slippers and they were brought to us in no time the complimentary lotion is so divine it left my skin feeling soo smooth and silkya must have in the dry vegas winter weather it all just felt so bougiei loved it one issue i had was the water wasnt very warm when i showered the first night it was fine the rest of our stay but during that period the water was only lukewarm at most also wished the lighting would be a little brighter in the bathrooms and hallways where the mirrors are i found it hard to do my makeup because it was all so dimly lit and poor selfie lightingother than that our stay here was delightful we got a great deal with the anniversary suite sale so we got our nd nights stay for huge steal so far i had a better experience here than vdara except for the lighting situation and i definitely look forward to staying here again|drbond is the main reason why i keep on going back i get in and out at a timely manner and he listens to what i have to say about my child staff i only give a   they never seem friendly and seems like they do not like their job but i deal with it because of the dr|new enthusiastic owners have cleaned up made repairs replaced missingbroken equipment and have added new equipment  rates seem reasonable to me and i have access to any anytime fitness in the world  from reno to the united kingdom my pass opens every door as expected  great neighborhood gym that will have most everything you need|who knows i was in a long line i really like the service cuz they were quick and the service was excellent|the food was great i had the fettuccini and my wife had the ravioli the ravioli was amazing the fettuccini was a little on the dry side for my liking they add a bread crumb to the fettuccini that makes it great also the portions are a little on the small side overall the service was great crystal helped us|if youre here just for dinner and a beer or maybe brunch then theres a good chance youll enjoy yourself if youve come to drink more than two beers you might be safe if you bring an extra benjamin although they have a top tier beer selection theyve quite simply priced me out its understandable for the price point for a cask ale or for a bottled specialty brew but for common microbrews on tap boston beer sierra nevada new belgium anchor that you can find readily and locally the mark up is preposterous  for a pint of fat tire or sam yes i am completely aware and cognizant its on the strip in crystals and it should be expected but as chris carter would say cmon manmy brother and i came here after a race during late night happy hour happy hour is the best time to have multiple beers because drafts are half off the average  price tag for a pint happy hour specials also include a dozen oysters for   wings which include the wing drum and tip and  sliders these food prices are a minute discount from the regular price and youre not really getting that good of a dealwe enjoyed the food that we did taste the east coast oysters were served with a mignonette straight horseradish and cocktail sauce the wings had a more tangy kick and the sliders were a decent size with sweet grilled onions and a sauce on the patty dennis was our server and he did an excellent job and had good knowledge of the beer list as he offered me a stone brewing milk stout after i found out that they were tapped out of the dragons milk after we finished eating the apps and drinking a couple of beers each our tab was sitting at  we didnt feel like going broke without even catching a buzz so we passed on entrees and called it a nighti dont doubt that the james beard awardwinning chefs food is delicious and i would come back to sample more but i would go with the game plan to not drink more than one beer if im on the strip and looking for an even larger beer selection with pints that are literally half the price ill head over to yard house in the linq|i really love the burgers fries and shakes here they hit the spot and remind me of the food from back home in los angeles however some employees seem very meh about their job its kind of a downer and compared to places like chick fil a and in n out the customer service falls short overall great place to grub at|awesome authentic filipino food cant go wrong with anything on the menu love the sinigang bangus and pinakbet we also got a large order of lumpia for our family party feels like eating at our grandmas kitchen|using the lt bucks at the lifespa has not been the most pleasant experience  i arrived for a pedicure i scheduled days prior and was told the nail tech went home sick yesterday and called out sick again today so i couldnt be seen  she was surprised no one called to inform me yeah me too  i made arrangements for childcare for my baby and rushed through errands to be there for that appointment  to make matters worse my lt bucks were expiring  days later and she was all booked up for the next couple days  she was nice enough to honor the expired points for an appointment the day after they expired but i was not happy when she advised me not to reschedule or i would forfeit the bucks  excuse me i was there for my appointment  i wouldve appreciated a phone call|must say the pizza is pretty damn good this pizzeria is right next to my nail shop but ive avoided trying it out due to mixed yelp reviews well yelp youve steered me wrong i could have been enjoying a tasty slice right after getting pampered we got an extra large pepperoni pie and garlic knots both were delish garlic knots are seasoned just right and the pizza was cheesy perfectly thin and carried just enough sauce very well done north end i look forward to frequenting this restaurant|the fresh noodles at cm are a treasure for this part of the valley the stir fry was savory and satisfying the soup was not too salty like many oriental soups can be would have liked more variety of veggies in the vegetable soup but i enjoyed the freshness and simple flavor of the the broth the potstickers were crazy big tasty too servers came up right away to take our order but were a little hard to get back to the table throughout the meal|this was among the best meals i have ever had when choosing a location for my birthday dinner i went back and forth and eventually we settled on stk we made a reservation and went truly everything about this place was phenomenal the service was on point the food was amazing and the atmosphere was so much fun i mean really a dj spinning at dinner okour service was wonderful we were checked on at all the appropriate times our server was attentive but never pushy and clearly knew the menu very well i started with the shrimp rice krispies and then had the classic filet with a side of mac  cheese for dinner everything was amazing i still cant get over the taste of the mac  cheese oh and did i mention the bread yeah amazingfinally the atmosphere was so much fun and the people watching was phenomenal i love people watching and there were lots of interesting and unique people to watch while dining at stk there was also a dj spinning but the music was kept at a very reasonable volume so that we could enjoy our dinner company|liked the place overall there are plenty of workers so you wont wait much with walk ins staff is friendly place seemed clean i liked cindy who did a nice job the hand massage lasted  secondsother than that her technique was great|went here for breakfast and we loved it their bread is thick and delicious the jam is homemade and the eggs are scrambled to perfectionwe couldnt help but try a brownie because they looked too good to pass up the brownie was amazing gluten free and made with almond flour  had a very rich chocolate taste loved every bite of it i definitely recommend this place|ok food prices are ok just an ok place to eat if you feel for steak the ribs are better at madison or baton rouge good service|the foods there arent that good sometimes bland and sometimes salty sushi selection are okay|best ramen house in town but the waiting line in terrible i hope they can expand to a bigger restaurant or have another location|bartender was nice good beer selection|its nice to have delivery options for a variety of restaurants in the area i use this service often when i dont feel like running out to pick up carry out they also have a delivery option for beer and wine which makes it extra easy to plan dinner however wait times on the website are always estimated a lot shorter than delivery takes with a  minute estimate it usually takes  minutes for delivery so i always take that into consideration when ordering|diverse menu i was here for lunch and had the bibimbap it came in a huge bowl and the staff were very accommodating with substitutions the rice cake at the bottom went surprisingly well with all the toppings  great cheese curds and fried pickles|we were visiting friends and they ordered pizza and wings the pepperoni  chicken pizza is delicious the honey hot wings were good too one slice of pizza was filling i will certainly return|barely average at best limited menu and dingy inside if youre waiting for the courthouse to open up  its sort of your only option|yup same great quality as nyc  the salads are fantastic|in no way is this the metropolitan museum of art in nyc but its a great alternative if youre looking for a little culture in charlotte  i was here for about two hours and that was enough to get through most of the main exhibits  there is a pretty diverse collection of pieces ranging from classic american art to modern installations  there were a few pieces that were definite highlightsmostly the modern and glass piecesthe temporary exhibits are an extra charge so if youre planning to see the entire museum go early to make it worth your timewhile i was there a few weeks ago they were setting up for a sitdown holiday party that night  as i was walking out close to closing time there were a few bar stations set up around the museum so im guessing this was one of those events where you can tour the museum at night with drinks for an event  i cant image how expensive it would be but its a great idea if youre looking to do something different for an event|handy spot to have nearby it seems like every major holiday sports team and cartoon has a dedicated sp and ot of items available yearround theres even a section that breaks down costume accessories and cups tablecloths etc by color heads up that the wedding area is pretty sparse and right up against the bachelorette items phalluses and wedding bells for everyonein addition to the decor and costumes store offers invitations and balloons by special order i havent used either service but i do come by frequently for seasonal decor items for my classroom and campus events staff are not particularly helpful and prices can be a bit high if you have enough notice to shop online or need a large amount of something that may be your better option|most mexican places i go i only stick to one or two items on the menu but i try something different every time i come here and its always delicious want to get full on the cheap youve come to the right way place and the best part is theyre  hourstheir carne asada is gristly for my taste the only thing i took a star off for i know thats typical of these places though|just had my first meal at los taquitos  good stuff  more on that later but first let me rant about how insulted i am to see safe mexican restaurants springing up that cater to squeamish diners  for example mucho macho taco urban taco phx burrito house and gadzooks these restaurants dont serve mexican food  they serve canned mexican themed food for people who are scared to go authenticnow that my gripe is out of the way let me say first that los taquitos is authentic  it was my first visit so i tried all the staples that measure a mexican restaurants authenticity  beans rice red chile sauce lengua beef tongue and menudo  yes i ate all of that plus a fish taco and all of it was goodtheres a bar with a decent selection of mexican beers and lots of different kinds of margaritas  i saw some liquor bottles but didnt focus long enough to say whether they have a decent selection of tequila or notfinally the other things i liked about los taquitos was the decor clean bathrooms and youd think this would be more common decent music  all of that adds to an enjoyable experience and a return visit by me|trendy place in arcadia was very busy on sat nite but we got seated right away with our reservations  great service  for appetizer somehow we got confused and ordered mac n cheese when we wanted the grilled cheese  oh well it was good with pancetta  i ordered the green chili stew  very good but the menu said came with frybread and it did not  came with tortillas which was a little disappointing  hubby liked the short ribs and mashed  it was yummy  dd  fianc split a big burger  looked good  overall a fun evening and we will prob return|loveeeeee this theater once you start coming here it will be hard to go back to a harkins ever again the key is to join the free rewards program on their website so the prices go down a little we went last night to see star wars  didnt get tickets early enough so we had to sit down at the lower level seats that dont recline  they were ok i wasnt nearly as comfortable as i wanted to be but for that one movie i will be ok so make sure to get the recliner chairs up top comes with free popcorn and water i always get a glass of wine  my boyfriend a beer they used to have drink specials on tuesday but yesterday we found out that they no longer do that boo|heard good reviews from yelp so we checked it out  food was delicous and there were a lot of choices  interior decor is nice and clean  worth waiting  minutes for food  they said there is a  hours limit for eating which is plenty of time for us  the crowd was young and civilized which made our eating experience pleasant  price is around  dinner per person  our server was nice and attentive   overall this was a pleasant eating experience|im not getting the hype its a buffet the service was great but the food was okay and the options were okay  i am glad that i went but wouldnt return|we read the many positive reviews so we decided to give the wicked spoon a try for brunch  it was mostly positive with a few dishes that were mediocrewe enjoyed the variety of foods we especially liked the bone marrow clams roasted sliced beef certain foods were just ok or a bit disappointing hash browns roasted pork belly caeser salad and sushi desserts were very good especially the fruitflavored gelato raspberry mango were real treatsservice was great our server was attentive and friendlywe paid  each for meal which i consider quite expensive for what we got considering the highs and lows of the meal our partys consensus is that we would probably take a pass on coming back|very slow service especially in the drive thru and on top of slow service they get the drinks wrong all the time|did anyone order me a plain cheeseis there anything better than pizza at am after a night on the town or pizza for lunch or pizza anytime really i say no this pizza place hits the spot every time there is always a wide variety of choices including pepperoni sausage and peppers veggie and yes plain cheese it comes by the slice or the whole pie and served up fresh and hotthis new york style pie is a thinner dough and a crunchy crust and comes with any tasty topping you want i love this place its a vegas strip staple look for the hallway next to the elevator on the third floor next to jaleo|for the price considering vegas high prices its good  pizza was  and more than enough to share between two people we had to take two pieces to go we ordered the boar pesto pizza it was very good  wine is pricy at glass for the cheapest glass but everywhere at the cosmo seems to be  price range  service was good i would recommend it|why have i never been here before recently i thought sportclips was the coolest but this locally owned oneoff had the idea first  at least locally sara s was my stylist she did a good job she did forget to offer me a beer  yes i said a beer the guy sitting next to me was having one  its part of their thing here ill be back for that and a good cut yall |i knew this place existed but didnt visit until today i wanted to get a bra fitting and i figured this would be a good place since i was already in the shopping center it was smaller than i expected and it was semi busy when i walked in so i tried on some items myself i then asked a worker about their fittings and someone was already helping a customer she was pretty great about it she helped three of us at the same time the employee jaci told me to go into a dressing room and measured me then she brought me a few different bra types and made sure they fit well either by checking or just asking me through the door i was happy to finally know my true size and grateful for the knowledgable ladies who assisted the prices are more expensive than what id pay even those on the sale racks however im a fairly frugal lady and usually hit up ross for their collection which is  and under but somas selection is pretty nice so i may go back and see if they have more sales after christmas|jaime bien malgr le fait de que a soit une

neighborhood spots for lunch and wine  lucky to have it so close|we were looking for someplace to celebrate our anniversary and have never eaten on this side of town we chose litchfields after receiving some recommendations from others who had eaten there the restaurant is located in the wigwam resort hidden way in the back so ask for directions upon arrival we were seated right away walking in i loved the openness of the dining area and how you were able to watch the food get prepared i noticed that they also had a few private dinning areas which would be perfect for large parties to come eatto start they brought bread and butter one of the best i have had in town we ate it so quickly that they brought us more then we had the ahi tuna it was delicious and the mustard on top complimented the dish perfectly for the main meal we had the colorado lamb rack and the brick roasted chicken with a side order of the smoked gouda mac and cheese the chicken was cooked perfectly and i loved the concept of polenta waffles but they were a bit dry even with the honey on top as a lover of mac and cheese that dish did not disappointto end the evening we received a complimentary dessert because we were celebrating our anniversary i think that is always a nice touch when a restaurant does that|items selectedchefs platter  month parmesan smoked blue cheese truffle tremor

behindtaking more chances than most italian places off  or even on  las vegas boulevard despite the limitations of a kitchen smaller than that of most summerlin homes due forni remains a sort of secret in the growing shadow of too many imports and chains|the food is amazing no doubt cute place i had been here before so i thought it would be fun to have a bday dinner here which i made reservations for there was only one server which was fine the place is small enough for one server to handle any how despite the huge hickey on the servers neck she was wearing sweats too ok ok i managed to get passed all that my party consisted of  people everyone had ordered so here comes the food mine came out first i waited for more plates to come out but after a good  minutes i said fuck it my food was getting cold so i began to eat then came another platetime passes then another we all ate one by one i had a friend finally get her plate after everyone had finished eating no apologies no compensation i guess they figured out it was my bday so they brought out a dessert which no one asked for and still charged me for it  all im saying was not the best experience ever but ill still return too bad it made a sour first impression on a few of my guests|wow i never knew this place existed until my friend wanted to meet here this place is great and it must have been built between the time i moved and now its amazing all of the new restaurants and businesses popping up in pittsburgh we had a wine tasting they have two options  oz tastings on the list for  or all of the list including the reserve wines for  we ended up getting the  i liked how he explained each one and how they are made i chose the red zinfandel and i did not even know they made red zinfandel i like all of the reds the whites were too bitter tasting for my palette but the reds were dry and smoother it was a slower time period so there wasnt many people there it seemed like they show you how to make wine there and they allow you to have parties there although there is no food served there you can bring your own and provide your own entertainment i love the atmosphere and the vibe they said they have live bands friday and saturday nights so they miss out on opportunities for rehearsal dinners and parties otherwise any other night is fine i wish they had like a cheese plate to pair with the wine like a wine and cheese tasting that would go nicely with their presentation overall i will come back to visit this place when i am in town this would be great for a date spot for new couples or get together for friends|the food was good the staff was friendly and prices reasonable it appeared that they prepared shrimp alongside other meats on the grill which does concern me ill definitely be back|i went here for lunch with coworkers and the food was very good i had the falafel sandwich and ordered a bowl of the egyptian lentil soup the soup was wonderful creamy and flavorful the sandwich was very good but it could have had a side of tahini or some additional dressing|i would say this is closer to a  star review  i ordered the chicken and beef teriyaki bowl  it was good  portions were a little on the small side  i decided to try this place because it was close to work and i was in a hurry  you will have to wait for your food|was in the area recently and decided to pop in for some food the sports book just happened to be right inside to the right from the entrance i entered from so i took a quick look it is definitely not the ultra modern setup you see at many of its peers around town but the odds are all up to date and written with markers on giant white boards that slides up and down behind the rows of betting windows  a lot of relatively smaller tvs hung way up top with various games on or replays of past matches and of course espn commentaries for checking out the latest sports odds this venue has what gamblers are looking for play responsibly|crowded like the border thats when you know this place is really good cant go wrong with anything if you are new to this place then i would recommend adobado  stars because there arent enough tables|my family stopped in for a quick bite yesterday afternoon before running some errands my parents and friend had been here before and enjoyed it quite a bit so they were stoked it was open the location is very convenient on the strip right across the street from the old stardustthe tacos al pastor were delicious and for  each theyre a little higher than other taquerias but much less than a fullservice restaurant there are different stations at the counter that you go up to based on whats type of meat you want  everything from carne asada and al pastor to sesos lengua and cabezai appreciated the plate of cebollitas grilled green onions and grilled peppers that came with the food and there was a station to grab asmany radishes and lime wedges that you want i dont often see orange bang in many places nowadays so we were stoked to get some here|bon restaurant italien la cuisine est savoureuse ils servent une excellente pizza au four  bois jai pris des olives en entre et une pizza aux artichauts et olives excellente lambiance est agrable malgr que la musique est un peu forte avec un resto plein le bruit est lev sinon le service est courtois et assez rapide|cool coffeeshop with enough seating and some good products i enjoyed the latte the only bad thing was some of their stuff wasnst available|located in the miracle mile shops at planet hollywood   you order your food at the counter then grab your table and they deliver your food    expect to pay about  per lobster roll  we ordered the connecticut roll which is a warm lobster roll with butter the cajun roll which has a little heat and then the miso roll flavored with miso topped with seaweed  shared lobster fries   good amounts of lobster in every roll and on the fries|use  yelp offer they are strict and will not adjust after they swiped your carddriving distance from the red rock casinoits good not great but not bad eitherfrom coming out of town i would not come back waste of a meal  but maybe if you are a

very heavy meal|the food is good but the service is amazing particularly delivery they are the fastest delivery weve ever seen|i set high expectations for this place due to my desire for great mediterranean and the mediterranean food that ive eaten in the past paired with the phenomenal reviews and ratings ive read and hearddont get me wrong food and experience was good and ill be returning or considering it again in the future but it wont be my go to spot or gotta have it again tomorrow i ordered the falafel platter one of my choice extras was a mediterranean salad which was quite tasty but was disappointed in the size i was expecting a side salad portion but in reality it was a togo side in the meal containerso probably  small to medium bites for my second option my choices were baba ghanoush eggplant or hummus i opted for the baba when i opened the platter i assumed they just gave me hummus because it was the consistency and color of hummus but didnt taste like baba or hummus so im not sure what that was that item was my least favorite now to the falafel it was quite good i enjoyed the seasoning and flavors perhaps i tasted some mint very enjoyable it came accompanied by some pita bread i also asked when ordering to make sure the yogurt cucumber sauce was in the platter on the falafel they insured that it was included no such sauce and that sauce is my fav there was some tahini which was goodmy coworker ordered the grape leaves appetizer they were presented well and she liked themcustomer service and timeliness was excellent wassim rang up my order no extra surprises the bill matched what was quoted on the phone when i placed the order for pickup they are open until pm it is close to my job the restaurant is setup cafe style bathroom was clean and stocked for any interested they are currently hiring seek within|ehhhhdecided to give it a try on a rainy day coworkers told me it wasnt the best place for burger but i gave them a try  for

rolls came out right away the kushi took about  minutes and the yakisoba over an hour the rolls were good and so was the kushi but unfortunately when the yakisoba finally came i couldnt eat it it came with the paper from a straw in it had it come from my straw i wouldve eaten it but i was unsure where it came from as it didnt come from our table  we received a discount and the dish was removed from our check but after an hour i was really looking forward to trying it may not be returningas for the service saw waiter a few times in the hour and  minutes we were there but only received one update on the length of time for the yakisoba and kushi|les tacos sont immangeables pour le reste cest bon  la dco est sympa  la musique du moment aussi et le personnel sympatique alors je le recommande mais pas les tacos|we went in our academic group lunch that way we needed something quick that fills and this place does good but its not a family dinner venue moreover the menu is very limited at least for lunch|this is a place i visit every time im in chandler what a great location especially at christmastime with all the downtown holiday lights and the inside of v is always warm and inviting we started with a server who knew about the wine list which was helpful in selecting ones that went well with our appetizers we enjoyed a tasty flatbread  i would have liked it crisper but the tomato sauce and sausage were excellent homemade sausage i think the brie platter was good but not too exciting wish we would have tried a meatcheese platternext time at any rate super service and a lovely after dinner hangout with live music|came in for a quick bite to eat before our long night of partying started in vegas  this place has plenty of open space everywhere with a huge bar and tvs everywhere in the restaurant the customer service here was very nice and friendly and he kept checking up on us to make sure we were okay  the food here was also delicious plenty of ways you can dress up your burger to any way of your likings that particular day|pupusas here are just okay they have a takeout special for  but if youre not feeding an army theyll run you anywhere from cents each no specified filling or each for the revueltas my preferred flavor not located in the best area but cozy enough inside i found that staff do speak english despite reviews to the contrary however  minutes to receive  takeout pupusas seemed to be a bit much oh and they charge  credit card service fee order was hot and greasy but filling was minimal and pupusas seemed doughier didnt really care for them but might keep the  bag in mind the next time im invited to a potluck|bloody marys could use some work but the kitchen sink is a must for your table the smoked wings are also fantastic with the cajun and insanity my mouth is watering just thinking about them the raspberry turkey chipotle is also very good nice beer options and pitchers on football sundays are  or  cant beat that|outstanding food and service  the short ribs ravioli was magnificent as was the lobster rigatonifantastic desserts as well  key lime and blueberry piesa bit pricey but a great experience yet again|this location has closed  lot of the brick and mortar hobby shops are not making it its a shame the few times i was in here people were friendly and helpful  seemed like most of their business was directed to ground vehicles|good quality american mexican food i would go back if im passing by but wouldnt make a special trip to go herethe good flavorful if youre looking for the kind of mexican food that uses sour creamthe not so good small no waiting spacethe unsure huge portions|this is a great addition to the dt gilbert scene breezy open bar and dining area make for a casual vibe with metro decor  perfect for a meet up with friends  wine by the glass til pm is a super deal there was a good variety of wines to choose from and the bruschetta platter was tasty nothing earthshattering in terms of originality but savory wellbalanced topping combinations like the tart sheeps milk cheese with sweettangy tomato jam bar service was super friendly too so it made for an allaround positive experience|the food is excellent and the prices are great issue i had was the service i receivedmy girlfriend and two of our friends went here on a sunday night now it wasnt horribly busy but it wasnt empty either we get to our table and our waiter gets us our drinks we all order appetizers soupssalads and our meals so far so good a few minutes later we all could use a refill of our drinks our waiter has disappeared and it looks like the other waiters are busy we are brought soupssalads but no appetizer given the portion size i actually didnt mind not receiving the appetizer asked our waiter for a refill of our drinks and he just nods his heads we dont ever see a refill our meals then shortly came out and once again we asked for a refill of our drinks waiter nods his head and still no refills and no sign of our waiter thereafter this is getting ridiculous the food was amazing definitely made up for the lack of service we were receiving we finish our meals and this is where ellis islas cafe goes downhill so we get our check and notice we were charged for the appetizers we never received so we grab another waiter to get our waiter our waiter reluctantly comes out and we tell him that there was a mistake with our check he looks at it and says sorry he will correct it we also insist we  speak with a managersupervisor he agrees to get him for us and then says oh would you guys like refills we have only asked for refills a few times already and never received themwe wait  minutes manager doesnt show so we ask again another  minutes pass and he finally shows up but doesnt come to our table he talks with our waiter looks at us and then rolls his eyes and whispers something to the waiter and walks away so now we get our new tab and it shows  off with the appetizers we never received still on the tab so once again we ask our waiter to please have the manager talk to us so we can get this straightened out we never got to talk with the manager but finally after another  minutes the problem got fixedi really did enjoy the food especially for the prices however the service was a little less than desired and almost makes me hesitant to come back|this hotel is ideal for those with kids no casinos and non smoking we were on the th floor try to get a higher one for a better view upon arrival of our one bedroom junior suite we were greater with a wall of glass overlooking the eiffel tower while the room and amenities are definitely  star i had to doc points on our customer service however when we got to the hotel we had to wait  hours for our room to be ready despite us giving a clear estimate of arrival they were rather rude about the whole situation and then gave us issues with our key cards we had to go back and forth from the front desk to the guy scanning our cards by the elevators  times before we got it to work he was being very rude to us as well we constantly had to call housekeeping to get multiple things as they wouldnt replace them for us when cleaning the room toilet paper shampoo towels etc overall if the customer service improved theyd definitely be one of the best hotels to stay at in vegas|i honestly love this place is the cheapest breakfast burritos or burritos in general that you can get that actually tastes great it is quite the hole in the wall place though if youre looking to take somebody out on a date or looking for a nice sit down restaurant this is not the place however if youre looking for a quick bite where the drive thru might not work sometimes this is the place to not break your wallet the staff is not super friendly as they might give you weird looks as you wait for your food every now and then regardless of all the food and price tags are quite worth it if youre ever in mesa this is the place to go they have filibertos size burritos that are cheaper there is also a small fee for debit cards i think its |the atmosphere at inaba makes the experience of dining here quite unique with the japanese decor around the restaurant you know something is definitely different about this restaurant in a good waythe staff was friendly and we were quickly seated on a saturday afternoon there were not many other customers there when my party and i joined other than two other diners the food was served in a timely manner and left me with a feeling of satisfaction great place to have japanese food with a japaneselike atmosphere that compliments your dining experience|dear pizza mi love your pizza your mission your atmosphere however i wish i could work on things longer than an hour before having to scheme a way to steal an outlet get more outlets also more speciality lunch slices|you can never go wrong ordering any kind burger hehe  although i always seem to order the same thing  bahn mi burger you gotta order the oxtail fries which is great for sharing mr ho burger is also awesome  so is ronin|this place is one of favorites in champaign however cant give it a full  stars and ill explain why but first let me share the goodthe food is amazing there isnt a thing i have had here that i didnt like and the polish as well as the pizza are favorites with pizza i normally dislike thin crust very much but at this place ill choose it over almost anything else ever had the bbq is awesome as well and when they have the jalapeo poppers they are also best ever hadnow the bad the place looks wise is run down and also very random also a place with a bar that closes at pm even on weekends in a college town at that just makes you wonder what they are doing also while it has only ever happened once in about  visits i did once on a totally dead sunday afternoon sit down for  mins before being talked to and my wife and i just left but other then that one time the place was amazing every other so  definitely|ah okay poutine hate to say it given the hype but ive had better at most fast food joints in montreal  i had the regular poutine with braised beef but found it to be watery and the cheese curds werent melted  had to ask x for the check and it took forever probably wont be back|i am in the bellagio drinking coffeewho cares how good the coffee is and the pastry btw both were goodtime to explore now|the pastries are great however i really wish there was a designated cashier and barista the girl behind the counter was really friendly and i felt bad for her because she not only had to take orders but make coffee as well its not her fault our coffee took a while to come out but the fault of poor management|way more expensive then you standardstarbucks very quick  order time and the drink was good i would go back just for convenience the staff was really nice and friendly|had the patty melt but should have just had a burger on a bunand the hot dogs looked fantastic will try next time for sure the patty melt was good the taste to me is similar to  guys the fries were way skinnynot sure if made fresh or frozen they were ok just not great now the custard  thats a winner  i had a mini hot fudge sundae and i believe it came to  and it was quite enough for me it was a good size and delicious  the staff is very courteous and friendly and i think that is missing in many establishments very clean as well i will return for sure|on a trs bien mang jai command le poisson avec la panure de doritos et jalapeos et ctait vraiment bon a coute  deux morceaux de poisson et les frites pas mal de choix de poissons et de panures diffrentes on a aussi command une pinte de burgundy cest la seule quils ont en fut le reste ctait en bouteilles cest un resto plutot grand je nirai pas  un autre resto pour un fish and chips|ok could the real morning squeeze please stand upive been to your place  days in a row and have had vastly different experiencesday    star  fantastic breakfast burrito solid performance on the coffeeday   star  cali benni  sloppy tasteless mush coffee tasted like it came from a gas stationpleas be more consistent you have a cool place good waitresses but whats with the inconsistency |hm it was a  star eating experience the service was fast and the food was fast too we were seated immediately and asked for drinks within  seconds we ordered a large pizza for the four of us and a tossed salad to share the salad came out fast and tasted perfect except for a few pieces of lettuce that were soggy then the pizza came out and tasted averagethe crust was slightly burnt and could have used some more butter around the edges|went here because of a  hour wait for wynn buffet that had been included with stay  like the rest of wynn it is beautiful   the chairs were very comfortable and you are right next to the casino my wife and i shared a sausage pizza and a cesar salad  salad had been just a salad  nothing great and had been expecting nothing more  the pizza had been just ok  the sausage on it was very good but the crust and sauce were not worth the price maybe im not fancy enough  service had been ok|ive seen the high reviews and decided to check it out for lunch i ordered my favorite thai dish red curry which i use to compare restaurants i was disappointedto start the spring roll was no spring roll it was cold and very small with practically no stuffing just fried dough the red curry was ok not greaton the positive side the waitress was friendly and welcoming the place was clean|went to cinebarre to watch star wars the force awakens in d scheduled for  pm walked in as a first timer after paying for tickets online ticket windows and customer service kiosks were empty so there was no one to check my qr code ticket and they were never checked or ask which theatre i needed to find after finally finding the theatre with no help of the ample yet unapproaching staff i found my place in line came and went and the russian cartoons about bus stops dance moves ant hills and robots with magnifying glasses continued to play as the previews i consider myself inclusive it was just odd different than any other premovie entertainment ive seen approaching pm the waitress finally came to take our order and offered no indication of moving start time or updatenow half an hour past the stated start time im getting some great commercialson charleston sc at a painfully high volume and the actual previews begin whoo hoooenjoyed the movie and never received d glasses and saw no one else with themassuming it was just a standard film sold as d online disappointingfor what its worth the service was pretty fast and reliable for food and drink in the theatrethis is my first and last time in this venue will recommend other options to friends and family unless theyre really into russian cartoons|it was a huge selection of delicious food and the service was good but based on its price i was expecting better sushi and chinese food|i was afraid that when my order was late everything would be cold and greasy this was not true at all everything was still hot and absolutely delicious i cant get enough of the chicken fried rice yum|dishes are pretty goodalthoughthey tend to have more fat on their meat dishesbut still decentmy main complaint is most of servers have big time attitudeespecially the son of the owneryoung guythere is absolutely zero customer service in this restaurantbeing nice and friendlyare something that they can not provide to all their customersthey are probably not being treated wellor maybethey are arrogant about the factthat they are the only decent filipino restaurantin the nw part of the valley|i was pretty excited to try this place since i love curry but i think it was just okay i actual prefer the curry that you can buy in boxes at the supermarket and make at home way morei ordered a vegetable curry with low spicy level they were pretty generous with the veggies which was nice the curry sauce was pretty thick which i think is what its supposed to be unfortunately i didnt like it being so thick and heavyits not bad but i think there are better food options around my friends seemed to enjoy it so if you really like curry then stop by|you wont ever know this place exists because of the huge mcdonalds in front of it and the india oven beside it total hole in the wall going in this place seemed to be a tad small for a restaurant but once we were seated i realized how large it actually is my bf ordered the panang curry  i ordered my usual of pad thai although i now wish i ordered papaya salad too i honestly think the panang curry was better the pad thai was definitely good but didnt live up to par with other places around vegas the one great thing about this place though is that it is  dont quote me on the  days part so if you are hungry late at night for some thaiwell hi there you just found a place youre welcome|pretty good mexican joint arizonastyle definitely recommend if youre stuck by a delayed flight great service and free refills|very cool restaurantceviche wasnt really what i expected but it was very tasty and turned out to be a great appetizer also tried a few specialties the huge combo platter with every piece of seafood on it they are very generous in the amount of seafood given as for the crab legs you know youre in the midwest so nothing much to complain about the flavor of the crab legs is very good also tried the pasta it was sour and spicy but very refreshingmy favorite was the seafood cocktail the staff recommended us to try hot cocktail instead of cold it was like a warm bowl of soup with tons of seafood in it very interesting|generally im a fan of this place its always fun and i love the concept its a great place for a date or a groupive only ever been at night so maybe its different for brunchmidday but the reason i dont give it  or  stars is the noise usually due to live band or music playing too loudly throughout its entirely too loud to have a conversation with anyone other than the person next to you normally this wouldnt be an issue in a bar environment but this is the kind of place that appeals to groups i love that there are multiple restaurants to chose from and comfy couchesarm chairs clustered in the patio area the service is always top notch and the food is solid i definitely recommend the cheese board and pretzels to start also love the drinks if you are on a budget get the brown bag special or head to the make shift bar near the corn hole|came here tonight first time came in to get a gel mani which is  reasonable price a little nervous coming to a shop ive never heard anything about the owner seemed ok a little pushy but im glad he wasnt doing my nails everyone else was friendly harvey did my mani and did a good job he was very neat when polishing the place do have a odd smell but not to where itll turn you away its cool typical nail shop nothing spectacular but i would come back to have harvey do my gel mani again|we love this location because the staff is so great friendly and accommodating with good attitudes not the biggest fan of their burgers  because they are a bit too greasy for me and almost  for a big burger is not very good value compared to some other places the six dollar burgers at carls jr are way more satisfying when you are hungry but the crispy chicken sandwich is to die for  it is one of the best fried chicken sandwiches i have ever had i dont even mind the wheat bun it is so goodthe fries are inconsistent  sometimes crazy oily sometimes dry but if you fill out the survey on your receipt you will never have to pay for fries again  each time you redeem it youll get another receipt with free fries on it not a bad way to get customers to return and they have smashpoints reward club and surprisingly its not a gimmick i have gotten two free meals so far on my points on top of free fries with every visit not bad  makes up for the overpriced sandwiches and the shakes are pretty good too but again not a great a value for  but still tasty and maybe the biggest surprise to me  how good the spinach and goat cheese salad is i would never consider getting salads at burger places its like buying bread from deli or meat from a bakery but i tried it once and was hooked pretty decent size for the good staff chicken sandwich spinach salad free fries with survey points club that worksthe bad greasy burger sandwiches and shakes are expensivethe ugly nothingtry the crispy chicken sandwich you will not be disappointed|food ambience  service were very good but we kinda felt misled because over the phone they said their cocktails and beer were between  during the happy hour but they took  off their  cocktail and  beers so just be aware of the prices when you go there|mucho gustoso el burrito the asada las mejores salsas que he probado el lugart esta muy clean|a friend had gone here a week ago and posted a beautiful picture of his pho on facebook with a good review so i decided i would venture in and check it out i have only had vietnamese food once before so i was ready for a second shoti started with their traditional roll which comes with a great peanut sauce it was fresh and light and the flavor was very pleasing  i showed the server the picture my friend posted and she identified it as their tonkinoise pho i cant say enough how much i enjoyed it the veggies meat noodles and broth were very pleasingthe prices were good the servers were friendly it took a bit of time to get my soup but they were very busy and the end result outweighed any rush i might have felt all in all a very good experience  i hemmed and hawed between four and five stars but left room that the next visit will be even better|citizens is very convenient if you are staying at the mandalay bay  two of the best dishes are the chicken noodle soup and the fish tacos|food is extremely mediocre the service was ok nothing great we came in around am and they only had a late night menu available it was overpriced for what we got my friend ordered a tuna sandwich it was very dry canned tuna taste better in my opinion all of the sandwiches come ale cart the fries were disgusting and costed  bucks we also has breakfast burritos which were ok nothing amazing i would never come back here and dont recommend anyone else either|i dined here three times during my recent stay at mandalay bay twice for breakfast and once for dinner breakfast is good not great dinner is much better service is okay overall a three star experience highlights breakfast service is very quick and theres a good variety on the menu the omelette i had was very good the breakfast potatoes were very bland the dinner menu accommodates almost anyone  vegetarians pescetarians and carnivores alike i had a fabulous shrimp and pasta dinner while my friend had the prime rib the portions here are huge and you get a good value for your dollar|this place was fantastic and horrible all at the same time they really need some leadership at the restaurant and training in customer service but my steak and eggs for the price were absolutely fabulous and the server was very nice once he figured out our table was his section the hostess also have no clue what they are doing and there were parties not seated and wait times miss quoted etc both my boyfriends meal and mine were really great however we will be back with low expectations for the service and high expectations for the food hopefully it was just a really bad day|i have been wanting to try this place for years and finally had a chance to get here  being from the midwest i grew up with all sorts of northern european dishes and beaver choice did not disappointwe were greeted by a wonderfully pleasant woman who is the owner  she is the type of lady who is so sweet and positive you just want to hug her  we spent a little time at the bar the wine menu is a little limited and the pours small but the beer selection was awesome a lot of imports from all over europewe were seated and had issues with the service throughout the night  our server was slow slow to take our order slow to come check on us and seemed to avoid our table in general  we also had issue with our entrees coming out and missing some items or just missing entrees entirely  we ordered some appetizers and received a plate of complimentary perogis to sharei ordered the scandinavian sampler swedish meatballs gravlax and a mini shoemakers box while the boy ordered the polish sampler  our server did not ask anyone what kind of perogis they wanted or tell us what flavors were available that day  all the food was great and reminded me of all the comfort food i ate growing up each dish came with  large side and  smaller sides  i loved their potato salad and their horseradish and beets were awesome  the boy shared some of his polish sausage with me get your mind out of the gutter and it was a must order as well  crisp snap of the casing and good flavor for the meatwill definitely be back i suggest making a reservation as the place is on the medium small side  i really want to come back on thursday for their unlimited soup salad and perogi special for  i hope they iron out the serving situation it was the only thing keeping them for  stars with this review|the food is good but way over priced one waffle and a piece of bacon for ten bucks it had a cool atmosphere and the people were friendly maybe i am just to dollar conscious for this place it was worth it to go once you wont be disappointed on the quality|the kimchi was good but the rest of the side dishes were mediocre wait was long the portion was small for an average grown up you need to order at least two portions overall the food was good and the place was relatively clean im not sure if i would come here again|good food and fun atmosphere  the free dessert is awesome  a bit off the strip but still worth the extra walk or short drive|we were looking for a korean restaurant for my mils bday  we didnt want to overpay for crappy food at ginseng  so i yelped around and found this gem  i had no idea what to expect and trusted yelp like i do most of the time  i called and made a reservation for  on a saturday night  the dinner turned out great and i would definitely return for vegas standards this is a good kbbq placerestaurantambiance  its located right off the strip convenient but towards the back of the lot  kinda hard to see  restaurant is not a holeinthewall type of place  kind of dark with all tables having a bbq grill top  we were fortunate enough to be given the private room in the back  i think it can comfortably seat  or so with  grills  it worked out well since we had a couple of small kids  my only knock was that the table height was kinda high for the chairs  they had tons of pillows to supplement but made it just a tad awkward  the place was initially empty around pm but quickly filled up and there was a wait by the time we left around pm  service  service was ok  not up to la standards but decent  i thought we would get a dedicated server for our group but through the evening the servers would rotate to help us out  grills were switched out when asked  here they do not cater to you and cook your meat for you like most of the la bbq places  food came out quite rapidly  they didnt clear out our plates but we had a table on the side that we just set all of the empty dishes  the banchan was never refilled we never asked  water was refilled when requested  they had a really nice birthday comp  ice cream macaroons with candle  all in all service was decentfood  in a large group you have to go with the preset menu  we opted for the gangnam bbq package for  next to highest package  this came with a lot of appetizers and side dishes and  cuts of meat  the appetizers included oysters good size ones and pretty fresh in quality shishito peppers really good per one of the guests fried calamari crunchy and meaty  nice spicy mayo dipping sauce too miso soup salad and bulgogi bibimpap  i really liked the bulgogi pap  basically meat and rice  the cuts of meat included bulgogi kalbi unmarinated steak marinatedunmarinated prime steak  i wished they would have included chadol as one of the selections  you couldnt really substitute anything  the meat quality was pretty good  good amount  they also included  different dipping sauces value  if it wasnt for the combo package i think it could have gotten a tad pricey  you have to pay for the banchan  i requested sahm and sahm jang and they charged me for that  we did the  person combo with  adults  but we ordered a lot of other things on top udon  different soups and more riceall in all a great korean bbq restaurant in las vegas  i would def make reservations ahead of time|good food  long wait though comfy seating inside as it is not crowded  meat was good quality|portions very small and wait is long even during off hours  meat is okay the same hotwater dough that becomes cream puffs and eclairs  and the straight cylinders therefore have a lighter texture than their potatobased counterparts these were classic iterations lightly herbed they had been gently browned on one side for a contrast to their pillowy interiors and served with crunchy celery root velvety sauteed blacktrumpet mushrooms soft and earthy goat cheese and a silken garlic cream for a very successful dish|pretty good place the chips and salsa is yummy i didnt really like the steak fajitasbut the deep fried beef burrito is amazing  get it with cheese inside you wont be sorry|love the items in this store but sometimes i feel awkward coming in sometimes they greet you sometimes they dont i feel as if one of the workers have a problem with me though like she stares at me weird the worker with the reddishbrown hair and bangs is the best she always trys to interact with the customers and recommends me items to buy as gifts a great place to shop for cute items only reason why i give it a  stars is because the place is too small with overprice items and sometimes i dont always get the best service there i still recommend people to shop here as they have a lot of cool items anyone could like|to rate and review restaurants we tend to only focus on the food quality rather than the ambiance we ordered an entree and three main dishes for sharing bread  cold and chewy they should be heated in the oven before serving polpette di vittelo veal meatballs slightly dry the dish should contain more tomato sauce for dipping quattro fromaggi pizza the crust was thin and not crispy enough when served on the table the bottom parts of this pizza became wet soft and slightly soggy tagliatelle al funghi  pasta has a fully al dante texture very fresh the portion was smaller than expected we were satisfied with the dish in general gnocchi al pomodoro no comment on this dish as i had no previous experience on this type of pasta but i personally would order another dish if we visit again finally we ordered a gelato tarfuto amaretto for our friend whose birthday will occur  days later|its ok and quick just about sums it up there arent that many great options for eating at the airport so its a good option for something quick before getting a flight its a typical yo sushi with a conveyor belt of dishes going round and you just pick what you want if you cant see the dish that you want then theyll make it to order but it can take a bit of time the sushi isnt anything special but its all freshly made and generally ok i always go for green tea to drink as they do unlimited refills in the price they have several options prepared next to the till for take away if youre in a rush and they even do the noodle ramen to go with just the stock to be added|good selection of meat and all you can eat service was great some meat was well underdone almost raw lamb was aweful but everything else was good very very expensive two of us two drinks and dessert with  tip was |bf and his brother like this place its not horrible really small portions some was really tasty others werent i ate so much salmon sushi the eel wasnt very good and yet it took so long to come out avocado roll was also lacking we are here on a slow night and the waitress is doing ok ill probably come back  to see if the quality is any better on a different night|a month back some girlfriends and i came in for breakfast we enjoyed our visit we had to wait a while to be seated and the bloody marys could have been a little better but the service and food was great a girlfriend picked the multiple types of pancakes and she thoroughly enjoyed all of them i would recommend this place they also have a huge breakfast burrito if your really hungry|vegas is vegas  there are many ways to do vegas  getting off the strip even if for a moment is a must for me  this place is worth leaving the strip for  no lines quiet you know a normal dining experience lets get down to the food  it was good very good  i have only been here once so that is why the  out of   we had the apple and manchego salad  how can such a simple salad an food experience  it is trust me  get it enjoy it  we had the mac  cheese albondigas and baby back ribs  yes we got our food on  the drinks were good too  go here  eat well  drink well  live well  dcor  out of food   out of drinks   out of service  out of cleanliness   out of |delicious just stick to the drinks and tapas if you are on a budget and want to feed a large group then order the big rice entre however the flavor is not great and is the reason for only  starsi came at dinner on december   it was great to have come|authentic mexican street food but better because you can sit down|food and environment of restaurant is pretty good but its entirely too expensive   bucks for a bowl of soup  fortunately i have had a gift card to use for a few lunches  my one and only food complaint is that the last two times i took food to go my clam chowder has been nothing much else but broth   little chunks of potato and barely any clam to speak of  that is disappointing|went on a tuesday with one of my friends she got the pizza and i got the trio tacos the shrimp fish and chicken not to bad at all really good and filled me up pizza was super good and wine was  off tuesdays and the tacos were  each and special was  off so  i was fulloh and the sweet stout was the best so damn good our waiter he was super cool and informative they have a hamburger challenge there if you finish your patties and  slices of cheese along with pickles without going to the bathroom or spewing it out its yours free and you get to name your own burger and this burger is  smackaroos good luck|wife and myself shared a forger pizza with alcohol milkshakes  both were very good  lots of tv to watch football   when you walk out you are right in the casino  service had been really good|my first experience here was very pleasant the lady who served us was very kind i ordered angel cream and mt fuji and was surprised at the little details they put into the food wasnt the best dessert ever but it was pretty decent i was more fascinated at how it looked rather than how it taste they also placed my glass of water on top this lego looking coaster i thought that was funny yet adorable waiting time for the dessert didnt take too long either for a place that was busy a little pricey overall but thats what you get for eating artsy types of foods  i guess i would warn those who are very claustrophobic that this place is very small with little amount of space to walk through tables are very close to one another and it is a little uncomfortable getting in and out of your seat i came here on a saturday at around  pm and as always parking lot was busy|do not all try their highly recommended menu items if you are really curious just order one of it and share it because it is honestly not great and just meant to fill you up recommend paprika smoked salmonpro great fish to rice ratio and better flavor than goyemon they arent that strict on finishing foodcon their dessert is not ayce except for their notsogreat ice cream disclaimer i am asian my review is bias because i love ice cream i ate there on saturday th of december at pm|my husband and i had a very unpleasant experience dealing with livng spaces we should have read yelp reviews before we shopped there we purchased a bed and mattress set in all fairness we had no problems with the sale staff they were professional and helpful and helped us locate the ideal  items the problem arose because of a store policy established by corporate located in california we were informed that we had to check the mattress carefully when it was delivered because once we signed for it there would be no refund we were not told that the mattress we ordered  memory foam would be delivered tightly rolled up and wrapped in plastic and would require a full hour to expand to its ultimate shape we told the delivery person that we couldnt sign off until the mattress had fully expanded the delivery person was very polite but had more deliveries to make my husband called the number on the sale receipt that was not a local number it took him to corporate headquartersthe people he dealt with were rude and unwilling to deal with the problem in a reasonable manner essentially my husband was told we had to sign and accept the mattress or reject it we did the latter because we couldnt inspect the fully expanded mattress he was then told there would be a  restocking feethe policy is unfair and unreasonble fortunately  the store manager shawna was reasonable and very accommodating when we returned to the store she offered a good resolution to the problem it is a shame that the corporate folks make such a bad impression on customers they can thank shawna for salvaging the transaction and our opinion of living spaces|visited last friday with a group of ladies had a wonderful time the wait staff was wonderful and attentive enjoyed seeing snowbound hard cider on tap had the bacon candy app and the chips and dip chips and dip was better as the dip is amazing bacon candy i would prefer it crisper but that is just a personal preference as a special they had a sweet potato bisque that was to die for for the last week i have been scouring the internet trying to find a recipe that might be half as good if this place was closer i would go multiple times a day for this soup pizza and pasta was divine but please order the soup|if you are a sewing or machine knitting enthusiast then get yourself to ddshes your man for machine repairs services or a brand new sparkling machinethe shop itself is almost like and aladins cave when you walk in as there are boxes piled up at the door  dd sells wool threads and other sewing nessities  i bought my dressmakers dummy from here my granny came down to get her machine knitting wool from here frequently tooits a busy wee shop and its quite tight so know what you are going in for otherwise you may find yourself gettin rather overwhelmed and lostdont let that put you off because he stocks a lot and if you are after a particular part he will probably be able to source it|i like this place i might be a tad swayed though because its only about  or  miles from my house a few things i like arelakeside view seating outside various board games in the back of the shop had a good time playing friends trivia while sitting outside and enjoying the viewhad really great customer service from a young gent the first few timesthey offer rewards if you give them your phone number ive already gotten a  off coupon and its only been a few times that ive visitedsome things that knocked the additional stars off of the reviewhave visited this place maybe  or  times within the past  months and only one yogurt flavor changed so the variety is kind of mehcustomer service hasnt really matched the first few times seems there is a younger gal working there lately and she seems almost annoyed when you get to the register i had to prompt her to ask for my phone number for the reward points because she doesnt ask super disappointingall in all its a pretty nice place if youre okay with the aforementioned details|good coffee but not a great pastry selection i would have appreciated more variety and higher quality pastries and muffins|if youre stopping by during the morning rush hour you will probably have a long wait here they are always super busy and tend to have a long line luckily starbucks made it easy for me to have zero wait through theyre amazing app i just preorder my drink when im heading there and they always have it ready for me when i arrive  baristas are friendly and always helpful parking kind of sucks here so just be wary of that overall its what you expect of a starbucks with a nice patio and friendly staff|wanted to have breakfast for lunch with a coworker and tried this place  the eggs benny joint style were delicious  the prior comments about the ham off the bone are spot on  perhaps the best ham ive ever had for breakfast anyway  my only mistake was getting the hash browns double crispy upon recommendation of the waitress  the were the equivalent of those old snacks shoestring potatoes but my friends looked absolutely perfect  i will definitely go back|i used to watch cake boss while i havent seen an episode in recent times i recall not only being amazed by buddy valastros cake designs but wishing i could try some of those hearty italian meals that he and his family would cook up as well i finally had my chance to try both the sweet and savory while my husband and i vacationed in las vegas buddy vs restaurant and carlos bakery are right across the way from each other inside the venetian the line for the bakery was a mile long so we opted to have lunch and enjoy one of the desserts in the restaurant instead i loved the feel of the place it was cozy and warm with large windows to view the gorgeous strip they serve warm focaccia bread with olive oil to start it was so light and fluffy we both asked for a second piece even though we promised each other we would save room for that dessert they offer a prix fix lunch special for  which is what my husband ordered you can choose from a few slightly smaller portions of appetizers or salads entrees or pastas and desserts he went with the meatballs chicken parmesan and cannoli i had the whole wheat penne primavera which included all sorts of tasty grilled veggies my husband split his cannoli with me i really didnt give him a choice p it was stuffed with sweet ricotta and dipped in chocolate chips and pistachio not to diss my hometown of st louis known for its italian foods and restaurants but this was the absolute best cannoli ive ever had in my life my husband and i both left buddy vs completely satisfied and determined that we would definitely return on our next trip thankfully we visit vegas often so i shouldnt have to wait too long for another cannoli|but when it comes

a cursed location and braddahs can make it in the extreme nw with continued support from the locals no tourists hererating fourstars yay im a fan|we stopped by mezzo the second floor on a saturday night even without a reservation probably advised we were seated right away we really enjoyed our server who really wowed us by describing and recommending a wine and weeks later were still raving about the pistachio and porchetta pizza|very happy with the service and quality  my daughter and i got pedicures and our nails done john was great  denny the manager was very personable and the receptionist was extremely customer service oriented we will definitely be visiting again|wings were really good the salads are pretty good too and they have good ranch good ranch meaning not oily is hard to come by plus they deliver ive read other comments about delivery being slow i had no problem with wait time for delivery dont wait till youre starving to order then get mad because you dont get your food instantly|i am not very comfortable with heights  i looked up at slotzilla and my legs were weak  my friends all forced me to do the zoomline as it was my bachelors party and it was the wrap up of the trip  after walking up the stairs got the initial gear on and then was directed to the elevator i kept thinking why did i let them talk me into this  the wait to finally get strapped in was long as well even though there were only two people ahead of me  it built up the drama and expectation  when i was finally strapped on and the operator said ready to go the door half opened  i was ready to go  the door close and we waited some more  about another minute passed and finally this time was for real  i pushed off and my fear of heights did not hit me at all  i actually looked down and around the entire time and felt nothing but a nice thrill  the line could be faster though  i did push off but i guess i didnt apply enough force  so for those who also have acrophobia this is really not much of a challenge  and you should give this a try|the food is great the service is soso this location is nice and clean not much in terms of decoron football game days its bogo beer on all beers which is pretty awesome be sure to ask for the full beer list as they dont automatically bring you that menuunfortunately when we went they were out of blue crab so we went for the alaskan king crab and shrimp the shrimp you can order by the  lb which is nice everything is minimum  lbwe went with the garlic butter seasoning with medium spice for the king crab and the hot n juicy seasoning with spicy spice for the shrimp it is definitely spicy and i say that as someone who loves spicy things we also ordered the cajun fries which were loaded with seasoning tip ask for a side of ranch for the fries the alaskan king crab legs were gigantic some of the biggest ive ever seen including in alaskaall the food was yummy i liked that they gave you gloves as well as bibs this really helped imho as your hands didnt get covered in sauce and seasoningwe were never offered another drink or if we wanted any other food we had to ask for several tools so like i said not exactly good service but the seasoning was on point and the seafood was fresh and yum so id be willing to overlook the service issues and eat here again|i think they did a great job turning the old sahara around into this a modernized trendy place  the location can be away from the core of strip but it serves as a good middle point between the downtown area and the strip  the monorail station at the hotel also makes a great transportation alternative around the strip and hopefully to the airport somedaythey have three different towers all of them have new rooms and i have stayed both sides before  the lux tower has the best rooms and the beds did seem bigger in comparisons with the other towers  with status good casino or hilton hhonors you could generally get an upgrade there  they do not feature any rooms with two queen size beds but rather full size so it could be a bit tight for a party of  to stay in one of those  the room rates are usually lower than the rest of the strip because of the location unless there is a big convention at the las vegas convention then the rate would skyrocket a few folds  i did not spent much time at the casino or the restaurants they seems very trendy as well and the restaurant selections within the hotel premise are reasonably good and they seem to try pleasing the younger generation foodie crowdof all the hilton brand hotels on the strip the sls was definitely my top choice whenever i stay in vegas  the staffs were professional and after a certain hour they have security guards at the elevator entrance ensuring only hotel guests can get in  the layout for both valets and selfparking were both conveniences enough|we booked in december when its slow and prices are low  we have read about the sls in la magazine and have seen the ads online so thought why not  the hotel is trying but not quite therethe room design was weird  our bed was in the middle of the room facing towards the window so you walked around all four sides of the bed to walk around  the wall behind the bed had a sink and mirror in the middle the toilet of the left side behind a sliding closet door and the shower was on the right behind a closet door  the doors dont close all of the way so you can hear everything going on in the bathroom  the bed lights up instead of having lamps in the room and there is a mirror over the bed  really  the finishes and details of the room werent done properly  some things looks old and worn out for being a new hotelwe also noticed too much staff and not enough to do  the girl in the gift shop was eating a sandwich while customers were in the store other people were at their post looking bored  some people would stop and ask to see your room key others would look away when you approached a couple of people would smile but not say anything  so why are they standing there  hell if i knownot really security but maybe to look like they are security  for being a new hotel and trying to draw interest i really thought they would have stepped up their game  hire the best friendliest people that understand service  pay attention to the finishes and room design  make it a worthwhile experience the gym was a nice place to work out but a lot of the machines were out of order  the restaurants were really good and the slots actually pay out  there are some nice things about this hotel but i dont enthusiastically endorse it  im not sure i would stay again because there are so many other places in vegas i would like to check out but its an okay option|my only complaint about this place is that they dont know the difference between a flauta and a enchilada if something this basic cant be figured out im skeptical about everything else on the menu ordered a flauta expecting to get a crunchy rolled tortilla and got a cheesy soft enchiladawhaaaat yeah no cmon guys thats a shame|this is the  review links tender spicy in its own way part of  brisket was magnificient practically melts in your mough flavorful of the pound  slices was horid tough tough tough dry and even sliced with the meats grain lenght dont get me wrong crossed sliced wouldnt help this very much two different cows guess one was young adult the other cow was  years old so sad  of rib slab was magnificent the rest was leaning dry must have gotten this rib from two pigs one was grandma pulled pork was  stars honestly the batch might have been cooked yesterday and reheated for this evening with their two type wonderful bbq sauces left overs next day should be ok for sandwhiches that tough brisket may need to be double chopped for sandwhiche use links should be yummy as overnight treat with some great toasted bun part of the tougher ribs overnight should be chewable with some effortsome our dinner was  stars some was  starswe ordered no sides based on yelp foodies warningtotal rating i hate to do this  stars as conservativelargely because  of the brisket should not have veen served to us whether cut across the grain or notwe cant risk going back  part of our  purchase was meh if thats ok for yelpers go eat here if not take wisdom from  stars yelp reviews herebut then again on fremont street one can blow multiple s in hour or less actually so many eateries here why not enjoy  on many their other offering under the streets long light show sad are we it could have been a  stars review and many many many return visitsdamn it brisket is beef it could have been smoked medium rare and be served ok even reheated and served and wont be tough why cook it to near well done lots yelprs here posted this with words like jerky dryposted is picture of dryish brisket not craved against the meat strain crain|it was so much fun lots of attractions but i wish the vendors were more spread out it felt as if the lines were within the walkways lots of people had strollers so it felt very crowded with traffic but then again this was on a friday night overall we had a really good time|its all about the lights and that was about it during this years version of glitters the main section is that square area near the library the rest of the  block area is just normal holiday lights the midweek crowd was sparse as we cruised to a parking spot right in the heart of the action the antique stores are really the only other thing to visit as i did not see hot cocoa santa etc during midweek if you walk very slowly and take a bunch of photos you may be able to kill an hour some mexicans are selling various items on a cart but with no english spoken or signs telling me what to buy those are vendors to avoid glitters is good but something seems to be missing to make it special|i love this place and always bring friends and family in im a big fan of the create your own concept and the fact that theres no limit on the ingredients you can put on the pizza quick service the pizza is always delicious too the only thing knocking their fifth star is theyre a bit stingy i like to put a bunch of ingredients so it doesnt typically bother me however last time i was there i brought a friend and he was almost done with his whole pizza when the manager came and asked us how it was then questioned why my friend asked for a box if he was going to waste it since he was practically done with his pizza he said he didnt ask for a box because he didnt they gave it to him in a box without asking so that was a little intrusive and rude to assume and judge the pizza does taste delicious though just make sure you dont get a box unless you want the manager trying to guilt you about it|its a gym a gym is a gym it has good amount of equipments space clean bathroom etcits equipped with a massage bed and chair  i believe a tanning bed but have never used any since its usually packed when i go everyone usually minds their own business and selfie addicts are about  so thats a bonus i mean you dont want to be doing a workout  needing the mirrors to make sure youre doing proper postures  a selfie fanatic is blocking your way right right cleanliness  starpaper towels  spray bottles located at every trash bins all over the gym floor bathrooms are always clean  even the fountains equipments  starunless youre a gym rat that needs this and that this place has a good amount of what you need you got your cardio machines that take about  of the main floor weights minutes workout space  abs  stretch area staffs  starfriendly and dont really bother theyre usually behind the counter on their phones or sometimes walking around cleaning some machines they dont hover which is greati often wonder tho when i go  always see one employee eating mcdonaldwhat does planet fitness brand really stand for i wouldnt necessarily mention to acquaintances that i workout regularly at planet fitness it might come off as a total wanker but from the outside itd seem like a lazy gym they even offer donuts and pizzas if it werent for my brotherinlaw  sister asking me to join this gym so my sister had a gym partner i wouldve never considered it especially seeing planet fitness videos and meme online ive seen an employee constantly bring in his fast food and eat it in the front seating area i tried other gyms before and never have i ever seen anything like this ive done ymca that lacked equipments  selfie arrogant infested  hour fitness but junk food  personal trainers that seems to need personal trainers gym put it this way its like owning a vape shop promoting a healthier option  fighting the bill trying to ban ecig but your employees are out front smoking their cigarettes in front of customers they should really choose their employees wisely i mean your staffs are the first impression for your company just saying overall its an okayish gym for inandout type of thing wonder how this planet fitness location gonna look once eos opens around the corner|an unexpected find in a nissan dealership hot fresh coffee bonus points for offering tasty seasonal specials and alternative milks soy prices are good service is friendly and they offer a halfoff yelp checkin discount didnt check in til after i ordered it so ill have to come back to use it they brew seattles best and offer teas and a variety of baked breakfast options such as bagels and muffins i wish more car service centers offered these kinds of amenities|updated my review here because the hummus is not up to par its the one thing that bugs me about this place its very watered down and runny other then the hummus the chicken skewer plate is a great choice always seasoned well with a side of warm pita|was excited to try a new brewery in las vegas while back in town for christmas i had learned of banger brewing in the travel magazine aboard my allegiant flight i was very pleased the beer is top notch my favorite being the morning joe my folks and i arrived at just the right time as it was happy hour and the tap room was actually pretty empty after ordering our initial brews tommy  the door guy and jack of all trades  offered us a short tour of the brewery and then gave us samples of some of the other beers el heffe jalapeno wheat the abyss by deschutes and the nightcap i highly recommend banger brewing the tap room is smallish but has board games for customers and is comfortable staff were friendly with great customer service and they respected my service dog my folks had fun and i had fun two thumbs up for this craft brew newbie to the vegas scene|first time visiting this place a couple nights ago first impression as we walk in is that its very small and im not just exaggerating here it was pretty busy since it was the evening we were seated very quickly the service was great our server was a tall guy with long hair i didnt catch his name but he was very polite and recommended some dishes i ended up with the chicken parm omg it was great it was really a big dish that also included spaghetti and bread i didnt think i would finish my food since it there a lot on my plate the food was so good that i ended up eating all of it i didnt want to let it go to waste i was very pleased with my visit i cant to come back and try something different|this place is worth checking out ive been here twice both times my meal has been excellent lobster with black pepper sauce is too die for oxtail garlic noodles were super tasty the beef carpaccio is delicious the belly buns are super good my husband has had the oxtail pho and the bone soup both were very good but the flavor of my meals was superb i cant complain about anything other than their computer system both times weve been stuck waiting over a half hour for our check for that they lose one star the service otherwise is great their happy hour is fantastic|so i have eaten here a couple of times with the family  once for dinner and once for lunch  the food is good and i do appreciate the good service we got on both visits  on the most recent visit the wife and i had pho oxtail fish tacos and steak and egg rice  the wife so enjoyed their pho last time she quickly selected the pho oxtail for her lunch  i went with the steak and egg rice and we went with the fish tacos for our appetizer     the fish tacos were good but got to be honest not great  the lacked the depth of flavor i expected and were kind of bland  the steak dish was slightly too salty which but it was a tasty dish  it was sweet with a little sour taste and paired well with the rice and over easy egg  i enjoyed the dish but wish the salt was used a little more sparingly     the highlight of he meal was the pho oxtail  they do some very good pho and the oxtail is one of the better ones the broth was so so good  it had such a good depth to it  it was a beef broth with the nice accent of mint in the background   the mint didnt overpower the dish but was there to add to the delicious flavor  the meat was plentiful and very tender and good  the wife was so happy with her choice and she prefers district ones pho over several other places in town     i do love their ambiance and have been in later in the evening when the crowd is there to have a mixed drink or two and enjoy some great food it is a happening place and can get very busy in the evenings and on weekends  the staff is excellent and took good care of us on both our visits  funny thing the daughter had been there with a friend just the day before  she brought home some leftovers and they were so good that we wanted to have d for lunch  i will gladly be back and look forward to another meal at d|stayed at the flamingo this vegas trip and had coffee here every morning a good break from starbucks also tried cinnamon roll one morning and it was very good|this is a nice movie theater nicely located next to a shopping center this is my first theater with a bar food and reclining seats i didnt get a chance to try the drinks or food but the recliners are first class the theater has all the latest in drink and concessions that are currently pretty up to date however the self serve drink machines are only a single person serve and creates a large line they tried to diminish this issue by placing several of them in a row|i would recommend going at sunset for the best views and pictures  we went up a little too late so it was very dark outside and when we attempted to take pictures you saw tons of glare from the interior and adjacent lights  also there are tons of greasy fingerprints on the glass so a clear view can be a challenge to find  they offered a deal on the tickets because of the holidays and you could easily upgrade to the open bar capsule  a neat experience|good food good service very fair prices   not the most healthy but overall very very good|i read others reviews and i am clearly in the middle here is the food great no its definitely not are the fries greasy and do they taste like the fryers arent cleaned often yeah folks im afraid so are the portions large yes very large are the beer and other specials priced reasonably yes they are was my service good at the bar yes jennifer was johnny on the spot and always smiling reality check this is a sports bar in the center of asu its predominately a college hangout it serves its purpose and audience i had the bbq bacon cheeseburger cooked medium their was so much sauce on the burger it had a life preserver attached to it i like bacon cooked medium but raw is just too stringy for me the fries wow if i would have rung my fries out i could have lubed my old ride for free a lot of grease is an understatement still id go back for the rest of it its a good place to hangout and watch some sports and the bartenders take care of their customers|came here with high expectations because of all the recommendations of this placethe place itself is very interesting with a nice and relaxing atmosphere a little bit crowded but very cozy at the same time the tables and walls are nicely decorated and the staff are also very friendlyas for food i tried the breakfast sandwich wasnt really what i expected but it still tastes good the breakfast burrito looks like a huge portion should get that if you came here with an extremely empty stomach the blind special wasnt really that special but i guess thats part of the game the milkshakes were great|excellent selection this is a great spot to sit chat while drinking a beer and watching a game on tv food is superb and staff is friendly highly recommend the cheesy taco with mashed potatoes  great selection of craft beers highly recommend|ordered delivery person on the phone was quite pleasantsushi was good fried rice has pretty legit veggies not just humdrum carrots and peas portions are generous my only complaint is the noodles in the chicken lo mein were soggy although i really shouldnt complain since it was free with a coupon on our menu it also arrived in a half hour when i was told  minutes  i will definitely be ordering from here again|this place rocks my party of five had a wonderful time dining at this restaurant for a party of  we were seated pretty quickly on a sunday morning i like the idea of having menus in newspaper form oldschool yet creativei had a chicken enchilada omelette with potatoes and it was absolutely delicious the addition of salsa and tortilla strips in the omelette were a great addition and added some great texture the potatoes were seasoned nicely and had a good flavor to them not much of a kick but enough flavor to make them something specialthis place is not too loud but dont expect any silence what can you expect from a place that is packed a great place to have a meal for breakfast or brunch too bad this place closes before dinner|ok overall love this place ive been coming for months and was super excited when they added sides and more apps to the menu about a month ago the bresaola starter is straight out of an italian trattoria and totally amazing im happy to see taglio innovating but i really wish theyd leave a few tried and true things alone their amatriciana pizza used to be my absolute favorite a lovely crust topped with a fantastic version of the sauce and a light dusting of cheese now they are taking a more deconstructed approach and i am not a fan same ingredients but the guanciale is in several large baconlike pieces instead of incorporated into the sauce same deal with red onion im not sure why they changed this but i wont be ordering it again unless they revert to the original awesomeness of this pizza other quibble for a roman style place taglio is sadly lacking in any seafood option every pizza place ive been in rome has an anchovy or tuna option and most have both id love to see something like that on the menu finally service is spotty courses arent well timed ive learned to order apps and then order pizza otherwise it all comes at once no big deal but fyi|there were four customers sitting at the large bar but the female bartender seemed to be ignoring usi ordered the cheeseburger and fries and u watched the kitchen as my order sat under the heat lamps until the bartender decided to bring my plate to me too long after my plate was delivered the bartender never asked how it was the customer sitting next to me had to wait to get more salad dressing while the bartender checked her phonelack of attention by the bartender really set me off she must have had a bad day she never smiled and looked put out when i asked about happy hour and instead pointed to the menu and said its all right there|the food was alright  the margarita was good service was okbut the manager by the window was super annoying  spent the whole time yelling at his employees i like to go to places where workers are treated right|if this place was open later it would be the perfect coffee house you really cant go wrong with this place the baked goods are great the breakfast sandwiches are awesome and the coffee is delicious|pretty good food a little pricey but not bad|great place but i think my  year old who is big for his age is almost too old to enjoy it its much more suited for the  months to  year olds great snacks for purchase|great place for drinks in chinatown always busy and fun now with a dj playing making even more sweet for the start of the night out ps  late night eats until  from the chinatown restaurant next door love it|count me as a fanim from san diego the microbrew capital of the world so i am familiar with quality beer  sin city brewery has great tastethe british style ale is on pointalso the little barstasting rooms are a nice oasis from the world of walkingcrowdsshopping|so close to home its hard not to shop here pretty decent shopping i like the open air concept it just sucks when its raining wish there was some type of awning over the walkways looking forward to another option in the food court only store that is missing is polo|nice space if your dog just needs to get out some energy very nice people that go there just wish everyone would work together to keep it clean bring a dog bowl that you can fill up and keep water on the dog side of the fence for your pup|i was seen within  mins george pa was super nice and took the time to listen to my concerns and did a good job  explaining  everything to me the ma and front desk staff were nice i would go back again|i am in love with this location it is super clean well lit and organizedeven though its a smaller version of walmart it has everything i need and i dont have to fight anyone for parking or deal with a cf i can shop in peaceeverything on the shelves are extremely organized makes it easy to find nothing is shoved to the back of the shelves whoever runs this location is doing a fantastic job not to mention you can still do your money transactions and they have self checkout as wellthe fact that its right down the street for me is big trouble|pretty tasty burgers i ordered the truffle burgers and truffle fries and they were truly something special the ahi tuna burger was a little weird for me and didnt mix well in my stomach the ice cream sandwich was also a little strange since it used buns instead of cookies but im giving them four stars for outstanding truffle recipes|i love umami so i was excited to see this in the sls  it is visually different than any other umami i have visited before  i get it its a sports bar but i think umami could have been as successful if they kept their modern design vs the man cave vibe  the pickle platter was bomb   i love funky flavors and each item brought a flavorful kick to my palette  the pickles were very craveablemy husband and i shared a burger hot dog and onion rings  onion rings are good but eat quickly or else you will see a pool of grease  the other thing different at this location is the lack of homemade ketchup  we received regular ketchup in a squeeze bottle and not the brownish red homemade stuff that we are used toi would definitely go back and recommend it|im really glad i found this place so close to home its a cute and trendy little location with friendly staff the atmosphere is just like youd expect chill and modern i played it safe this time and had their original aai bowl i have to say i wasnt disappointed it was fruity which is to be expected and sweet the granola added a perfect crunch and the fruit that topped it off was deliciously ripe the only tiny complaint i had was the amount of granola which can be easily fixed for next time ill just ask for lessall in all the service was great and the bowl was delicious im definitely coming back|after hiking arthurs seat stopped in here for some tea they have a relatively large tea selection i tried the apple loves mint tea it was good but nothing spectacular they did have some nice looking pastries and toasties that i would have tried if i was hungrier all in all id say it was pretty a ok  worked out nicely for a quick rest stop which is what we were looking for|i just recently stayed here for four nights with my girlfriend and it was a great experience the rooms were nice they were spacious they had wifi room service they had a big screen television the bed was huge and a small refrigerator housekeeping was always there to clean up anything they would always take our trash out change our towels and vacuum  that is not all they have they also have some shopping stores on the first floor a coffee shop and my favorite the casino with two bars and a buffet restaurant the margaritas were delicious the casino had good slot machines i won  in one of them one of the things that bother me was the walls in our room werent sound proof at night i would hear people talking despite them talking in a low voice and the television blasting despite being in a low tone i dont want to hear anyones conversation the last thing to point out is the casino being littered with beer bottles margaritas glasses and cigarette buds i like the fact that some of the workers were cleaning up but some were just walking around and i dont like the fact that when i am at a slot machine that i like i dont want to be sitting next to left over glasses or cigarette buds overall my experience was great and i would stay again because it is a great hotel but needs some improvements|nick was very quick and responsive  had a leak detected sunday night we was over first thing monday morning  he detected the leak showed where it wasnt working and made the fix very quick  with another leak pop up next day nick was over right away and fixed with no cost since he was over the day before|this was my second visit to a capriottis first at this location  it looks like a new location located in the shopping area in summerlin  we arrived at around pm and found it to be pretty empty  no lines  restaurantambiance  clean and bright  quite a contrast from the one i had visited off the strip  decent amount of tables indoors as well as outdoors  the restrooms were clean  service  you order at the counter  cashiers were friendly and met us with a smile  food was brought out to our table by a server  he was quick to ask if we needed extra plates or utensils  we had to request for the peppers  but other than that no complaints with servicefood  they pretty much have the same menu if i recall  i went with the basic and got the bobbie cheesesteak and the pastrami  i was never a fan of the bobbie  but the cheesesteak and pastrami were both pretty good  was it the best sandwich ever no  but it was good  we got the large and it was pretty darn big  easily could have been split  i got the turkey chili and thought it was bland  we also ordered the balsamic chicken salad and that was ok a tad too much dressing  all in all a decent sandwich shop  prob not one that i would drive out of the way for|the latest incarnation of this pub has an old timey vibe and quite an impressive beverage menu they also share a kitchen with the adjacent whist stove  spirits food such as sliders for  is decent and affordable during the  happy hours if not for the gaming its unlikely i would enjoy this place quite as much its a great location that seems to reinvent itself every few years but keep the gaming they have a players club shared with whist and balboa pizza they seem to have a decent crowd for football games and happy hourreverse happy hour check out the giant wheel o prizes shots gift certificates that is utilized during i believe only monday football games picnic tables outside are available as weather permits|came here for my last prom to get my mani and pedi with my friend back in may they didnt ask me what shape i wanted my nails and just did as they wanted to but the service was quick my friend was satisfied with her nails until her cuticle started bleeding because the woman had cut it too deep i told her to go inform them on the cuticle but she brushed it off but was bleeding pretty bad i dont think any nail salon should let any of their clients bleed because they should know how deep enough to snip off the cuticle|this place has great food every time i come i am super satisfied with my meal i have to give this place  stars because the service is super slow there is no urgency among the staff  min wait to get order taken  min for drinks and  min for food never come here when you are in a rush such a shame bad service great food i am sure the restaurant is losing business because of this|good food very original menu coffee was better then most around original review is still posted below i was contacted by the owner and i feel that level of customer service required and upgraded ratingnice people and interesting menu the oats and peppers with avacado and poached eggs was very good coffee is not bad either setup is order at the counter and they play wheres waldo finding the owner of the food if you like the laid back hippie whatever atmosphere this is a solid option if you want a professional culinary experience when your out skip this one|they have some new stuff in their menu as well please request for recommendations according to the tastei have tried both vegetarian and nonvegetarian both have turned out nice be careful about the spice levels and start at a low level if you are not surethe food is flavorful and true to the indian taste|we tried their takeout the food was flavorful but portions were small and prices were moderate to high when compared with other mexican restaurant s la casa de juana is okay but nothing special|the salads here are wonderful so long as you customize your own dont ever order a premade salad from here you have no option as to if youd like the dressing on the side or how you would like it choppedalso some not all of the workers here are not on point theyre starting to get slow from the time you place your order to the time youre handed your salad takes about  minutes for just a salad god forbid you come here during the lunch rush i hope you plan to make up the extra lunch time you wasted in line here|awesome dinner liked it

accompanies the fresh spring rolls was delicious its not far from work so ill probably make my way here once or twice month yum |absolutely no frills but stewardship was awesome we got xmas songs in flight and she made funny cracks furing flight made the flight more enjoyable| stars it was very busy at rise up bakery this morning  i arrived sometime between  and  am and as expected rub was humming  not with customers i was the only one there but with one cashier who was busy bagging pickup orders and icing cinnamon rolls as they finished cooling off on the bakers racks and three bakers including an apprentice flouring the table or scraping them clean in preparation to knead more dough for foccacia  baguettes bread loaves cake breads cinnamon rolls babkas cookies and bars oh my  i assumed that people would be in and out to pick up their holiday orders and sure enough many did show up to pick up tomato and pesto focaccia pumpkin and chocolate chip breads and sour dough breads among other itemsi came in to buy peach  blueberry loaf and i left with two said loaves cant remember how much each a french baguette  a pumpkin and chocolate chip bread  two sliced breads honey wheat and white with the white freshsliced right before bagging an oatmealraisin cookie  or  and two scones a raspberry and a blueberry  each i think  the scones were surprisingly not dry were sweet and buttery and did not need extra butter or curd spreads to enjoy and despite having a powdery crumbly texture was not offputting like most dry scones ive tried in the past  if i were to try to improve on these scones i would add more fruit but thats just me being too mindful of all the butter that i know goes into scone recipes  i figure if theres more fruit in the batter then that must mean theres less butter in the recipe  hehe  i know silly meit was nice to see that even though the bakers were busy baking and the cashier a second arrived  minutes or so after i arrived was busy filling catering orders while making sure the store was amplystocked for walkins that said cashier was not too busy to make customers feel notrushed in their selections  we guests and cashier traded stories on favorite local haunts favorite bakery items and one customer even described how she presented the tomatopesto bread to her house guests hot tomato soup and said bread for dinner and everyone taking a loaf home after as a gift from their host  the cashier then added that she liked to warm the pesto bread and then add tuna on toprise up bakery supplies four bread loaves to whole foods white wheat cinnamonapple and the fourth may be dillrye which sell at  each  buy them here as well as other selections at just  a loaf  dont forget to use the loyalty cards for sliced loaf purchases buy ten sliced loaves and get the next one freei asked if rub supplies local restaurants with their breads and was told yes but i could not clearly hear the name she mentioned  i will edit this review once i

the hype though i still like in n out animal style better but like this place better than most of the other popular burger places|located in the new york new york casino  burgers are made fresh to order  patty was juicy tomato and lettuce was fresh tasty sauce bread perfectly toasted but still soft   ordered the cheese crinkled fries which were nice and crispy    the restaurant gets pretty crowded but the line to place your order moves pretty quickly   expect to wait but worth it  wish they opened one in la|after hearing that they were opening a ss in the west i got so excited because i seriously loooove shake shack it was my favorite spot back when i visited new york a few years agothe vegas location was definitely a nice reminder of my blissful ny experience but unfortunately was not an exact replica of the holy burger franchise that i know and love sure the burger was good but it didnt have that wow factor from the shake shack ive had in ny the shroom burger is supposed to be mindblowing the moment you bite into it a huge slice of portobello and cheese slowly melting into your mouth disappointingly this fried shroom patty was smaller than expected and just tasted plain greasy the cheese fries were just as delicious and the custard was no disappointment either the custardwow so smooth creamy delicious and not overwhelmingly sweet the perfect dessert also the seating situation is a nightmare people are gathered like vultures and waiting around for seats to open|i have tried this place for weekday lunch buffetboth friday and nonfriday their buffets have some very good food items very flavorful true to indian tastethe friday buffet has some really good additions to the menu including sweet dessertsthey are friendly the place is clean and welllighted and popularwould also highly recommend for nonvegetarian items and vegetarian items there are plenty and all are very good that is a rare for any indian restauranti will try a la carte one of these days and update my review|this place looks like chipotle but theyve got a few other options like fish tacos and nachos i got the bowl with shredded beef which was alright the red salsa i probably asked for four scoops thinking itd be like chipotle but it is actually  x spicier yeah im sweating from my nose right now thinking and talking about it because i was in for a surprise when i took a bite of my burrito bowl so thats an fyi for ya if you like spicy red sauce the fish taco was oh kay the fried codfish was awesome but the sauces in the taco were just average and i especially wasnt fond of the tortilla its bought apparently and you can tellservice was good restaurant is clean i was passing by and starving so i gave it a shot id give a solid  stars for this place would i come back i guess id rather go to a holeinthe wall or taco truck  for a taco is quite pricey when it tastes just ok the question comes down to chipotle or this place as that would be a fair comparison i think the shredded beef was delicious and possibly tastier the portion was a bit smaller and price is competitive im kinda sold on chipotles red sauce so that might tip me over a tad bit but if youre looking for some quick fish tacos in the area id give this place a shot|room was large and the flat screen tv was great  the rooms felt slightly outdated as did the heater  ac which didnt work very well  no bugs  great staff decent area breakfast was mediocre at besti would definitely stay here again because of the cheap cost and room size|clean place love it when i can see into the kitchen  caesar salad and beef tacos  very tasty food and really friendly staff good value for hotel restaurantcheers|we were staying at the sls and wanted a late night dinner  northside provides the room service for the hotel but we decided to run downstairs and eat at the actual restaurant  its open  and has a extensive menu but not too extensive where you question the quality of the food  the decor is very cool and modern and the service was great   we ordered off of the chinese menu and enjoyed everything we tried  we also ordered the banana pie dessert and it was tasty  although the sls hotel is spotty their restaurants do not disappoint  i would recommend this cafe if you are staying at the hotel or just visiting| stars because the food was good but we went there during the happy hour pm and as listed on the website with an order of an entree or a sandwich get any appetizers for  come to find out none of the crews know about  we had to show the website to them then a few minutes after we ordered the server came back telling us that they can only do the sinful tots for  and nothing else i guess any means limited to one appetizers|service was very nice friendly nothing else was worth going back for service was very slow my potatoes were good my husbands were very bland almost like they forgot to season them my meatloaf was way overdone and cold my husbands eggs were good overall a mediocre experience we might give it a second chance sometime but we certainly wont rush to get back there|nice place good food but the music is way to loud you have to yell to visit probably would return|here with a living social coupon the restaurant itself is nice old style italian located next to the food court in the back of a getto casino the california pizza i order was pretty good im a pizza aficionado   stars for the food  stars for the restaurant and the service  stars for the location|tldr an easy and relatively lowpriced option for paleogf meal service with low calorie counts i dont see myself being a regular customer and i wasnt thrilled with the lack of contact with customer service but flavors and portions are better than they appearissue  my order arrived  hours late scheduled for  not received by pm no email notifications and no way to track i confirmed that they took money out of my account and that i had the delivery date correct theres no way to contact anyone directly but if theres a delay with your order the faq page says to email their support department the following day implying that this is fairly common convenience of preordering is irrelevant if they cant keep to stated delivery time and i end up without lunchdinner waiting an extra day so far no one from the company has acknowledged the delay or even reached out with a form letter or link for feedbackissue  full disclosure i ordered with their half off promo i cant imagine anyone paying meal for this its essentially tv dinners one step removed from the atkins line the food doesnt look appetizing and it literally arrives frozen solid further lending the comparisons to your grocerystore aisle food fresh  frozen the cook times are not accurate all of meals needed at least an additional minute if not double the listed time just to get heated through im aware that there can be cooking variations with microwave wattage and elevation but this is ridiculous food is icy inside when following directionsthe positivesthey offer large menus of over  breakfast lunch and dinner meals each week and i like that you can fully customize each meal instead of just in pairs like with other services but the food is not exciting and service so nonexistent its not worth the price or arguable convenience note that you have to join order and check a specific page then download a pdf simply to view calorie counts or additional nutrition info not sure why this isnt just printed on the label however counts are very reasonable for portion sizetip after placing your first order immediately put a hold on all additional weeks until you try and decide if you want to continue freshly one requires ninetysix hours four whole days notice in order to change or cancel any service which is barely enough time to even eat what they ship before another one is on its way|cool server for giving us a discountnice ambience yummy soju drinks go check them out pretty cool chill spot|i usually grab my ar coffee at hula but today i was in the stockbridge area and needed lunch and refuel of coffee  i hadnt tried ars new place yet so its defo a double whammyinside the tables are rustic as the whole interior but its cosy which is quite weird considering flower shops need be kept very cool yes i said flower shop but that covered by having the flowers in a display cooler that is quite coldar shares the shop with the white flower company  so it has a very different feel than a regular coffee place  its still relaxing thoughplenty of seats to sit down and chill with that ar coffee  there is a back room if the first tables are taken  looks somewhat quieter than that of the main room toopossibly of latch malfunctions in the toilet  please fix this ar  sitting on the throne and having a visitor isnt on my list of top priorities  people pull the door too hard as there is no sign to say if the toilet is vacant or not and then the latch jumps ta dahanyway back to coffee chat  flat white was exceptional good and the sandwich with smoked cheese olives cucumber and more was pretty darn tasty too  would i be back yeah sure|my favorite spot to come to in the epicenter love the diversity great space and great party|customer service sucked i asked the man helping me if they had cheese pizza he said yes in the oven i asked how long will it take he replied im not sure i also ordered a small drink only for it to be filled more then half way with ice|i really really want to love this place i have been here  times i feel like that qualifies me to have a pretty decent basis to leave a review i have tried something different each time the thing that drives me crazy about this place is the menu it hangs on a wall on tv screens its not near the register so when you walk up to the register and are deciding between two things you have to ask the cashier questions i have had a different one every time all teenagers they are always nice but they never know the menu i have been told the steak and blue cheese salad has wait for it blue cheese but upon receiving it i find out it actually doesnt have any cheese at all its just a dressing i was also told the chicken avocado and strawberry salad didnt have any other ingredients it actually has bacon and walnuts and cucumbers none f which i am the biggest fan of also the staff tends to disappear its like there is some magical room they go into that has sound proof walls today after i got my salad they gave me this gross citrus dressing and then they went into the panic room and i stood at the register for  minutes saying hello really loud finally i heard a door close and the kid was back the chef also came walking back in the restaurant from the front door it was bizarro also the ramen which i have had both as a take out and inside the restaurant never has enough broth its always a ton of noodles like  pieces of broccoli and an afterthought of broth its ramen people give us broth otherwise the food is fresh which i appreciate i hope they get their shizz together these are things that can be fixed i am hopeful i love nonchain restaurants i will continue to support them as my neighborhood restaurant and i am rooting for them side note the kid just gave a twerker a water cop and he has been sitting at a table across from me staring at me and itching his face like crazy in between leering and smiling at me while mouthing words its creepy please dont water the local drug addicts|vraiment mon spot prfr pour les sushis dans villeray excellent rapport qualit prix et des combos du chefs toujours super frais   je prends toujours  emporter car la place est assez petite et pas tant invitante mais par contre le service est toujours trs chaleureux et souriant mme au tlphone|good people but thats not what makes a business you need great service as well you can ask for a certain food they have on the menu and they wont have it i ordered a breakfast burrito that already comes with potato eggs and cheese plus whatever meat they offer for it i take a bite of my burrito and i see that they put french fries in it legit french fries they taste a day old and its not a good combination to have in a burrito it doesnt taste great it comes with green salsa on the side the salsa is good just too watery|this is basically chipotle bowls for greek food  and i am a fan  i had the chicken which was really nicely cooked and seasoned over lemon rice  i added tzatziki cucumbers beans with kale and tomatoes olives feta chick peas and red onion  it comes with two pieces of pita break  i also ordered grape leaves as they are my goto green food item  these left a bit to be desired but the rest of the meal was delicious  they also have a yogurt bar which i will have to try out next|this off the strip restaurant looks very nice on the inside the food is decent not really exceptional we order the vegetarian egg roll pineapple fried rice without shrimp and yellow curry while the entrees were good the egg roll was ordinary i have had better egg rolls in other less nice looking thai places the main issue was the thick the fried dough the portion sizes are small but also not super small each entree is good for one person at the most which is unlike most thai places the desserts look fantastic and i am sure they tasted fantastic however we were not super adventurous and decided to try their chocolate mousse cake it was fantastic i wish we could have tried their creme brle which looked like it was masterfully crafted too late maybe next time|overall a pretty cool little joint they were having a busy night and seemed to forget about our reservation but managed to get our large group out on the patio   that worked great until it began to rain and the staff worked quickly to get us in a covered area   the food was good i had the adult grilled cheese which had the perfect  amount of spice  they were large plates so be sure to bring your appetite|ate here with kids while staying at llv it was pretty empty because it was early and on a sunday in december service was great atmosphere was very comfortable tuna tartare excellent flatbread very good wedge salad phenomenal salad w grilled chicken and cheeseburger were very good the filet for my daughter they asked me to let them butterfly it   we ordered hers to be cooked med well mine medium not sure why they wanted to butterfly it because i also ordered a filet so both would be cooking roughly same time so hers came out way overcooked and basically  dollars of well done cubed steak i could get at a diner  my filet was perfectly cooked but had an odd seasoning  smell not sure what the dry rub is they use but its not real good kind of too salty  fishy aroma there was a new chef cooking that night so maybe its just a breaking in period we hit overall this is a great place and with that is going to be a great bill we were  adults and  kids  bottle wine and  apps  bucks with  tip i definitely would have gone  stars without the filets issues  i would come backbut only after winning a few hundred gambling to cover it|in day time outside at the roadside of their plaza a man is standing with a placard of  discount for first time customersso when i went with my daughter at their place for manicure and pedicure their services were good but when at payment time i asked for the discount i was told its for next week onwards though someone was given  when i was checking in so my question is why some random people getting discount this week and some not and  they should put out on placard the dates too if its for next week onwards|i was glad to read reviews on yelp as we were headed to mai but saw this place was vietnamese and thought oh lets try it yummy had bahn mi  the hubby had  and the parentals had shrimp stir fry we all started with summer rolls everything was fresh and delicious  didnt try pho so cant comment on it|food great selection of meats from beef pork to chicken my daughter loved the taste of the meat selections the sides were a great addition to the meats although they did  not serve the rice i had to ask rice to go with the food that we cookedambiance good place for beer drinks and of course meatsservice services was good had to ask the sesame oil with salt overall would definitely come back eat and enjoy the cooked meats while drinking with friends|i visited this place when it first opened we came in the afternoon and the place was fairly spacious and for the most part empty this was actually a welcome change from waiting in crammed spaces for hours the booths looked clean and the decor modern the service was very much on point and they were extremely attentivei guess my main gripe was the quality and lack of flavor in the meats we sampled practically all of the offerings including the marinated and non marinated options everything lacked flavor completely i actually found their banchan more enjoyable than the meats themselves i dont think this will become a regular place for our korean bbq fix unfortunatley|nice little kosher restaurent had the falafel plate i was quite impressed with the flavours it was quite simple and fresh the falafel a were nice and crispy cabbage salad was simplei loved the charisa hot sauce was nice and spicy loved the flavours pita bread was thick and warm ill com back to try other plates while looking around i find the plates quite large and all looks good|been there several times for drinks after work  great bar  bartenders are top flight  can get rather noisy but good overall buzz  had some apps last night and the shredded pork quesadillas were terrific  more like a meal so share|the oyster selection great service great oysters and a great city market feel it was a little bit pricey for a dozen oysters and a cheap glass of champagne but i enjoyed the experience|to start with we were seated at a table right next to the door where i had specifically requested not to sit since it was  degrees outside the table ended up being tolerable only because there was a heater next to us i ordered the sirloin medium rare which came out and was not even rare almost raw i sent it back and surprisingly received a fresh plate of food rather than them just throwing it back on the grill but again it wasnt cooked finally the third sirloin came out cooked enough to eat and the flavor was good but im pretty sure it was the same st dish i had sent back and it had less meat on it we also both had the coconut squash bisque which was essentially a thick puree but tasty my boyfriend had the fish fry and didnt have any complaints the waiter took my sirloin off the check since i had to send it back twice which was nice id be willing to give this place another try|super friendly staff very clean facility super busy around pm|ordered the pork bun and tonkotsu ramen the bun was deelicious and i would come back here just to eat that again the tonkotsu was good the broth left me wanting something more but the noodles were good and the pork slices even better i hear the miso ramen is excellent so i will be back to try that the atmosphere was very warm lots of wood paneling and mostly barshared seating with a couple standalone tables really glad to see a great ramen spot open up in charlotte|everything was delicious one thing we didnt get a hello at the door nor was the hostess welcoming when we first arrived it took min before someone put our name on the list when there was no one in the lobby they need to improve customer service but other than that everything was awesome|the food was good but the service was very poor it seemed like a very chaotic scene we had different servers at times it was a monday night too youd think it might be a slow night perhaps its because christmas is this week and everyone is out shopping who knows after we were seated it took about  minutes to be greeted by a server my food order and my friends food order were delivered incorrect i just had them deduct the error from the bill and not bother with a correctioni had high hopes for this place maybe ill go back someday i visited the indian school road location once and it was a great experience|i really wanted to like this place its closeish to work and i love a good good hibachi chicken plate for lunch it was okay its in a strip mall and the food is quick i had the hibachi chicken with fried rice the chicken was okay the sauce was different i like a really light clean taste with fresh veggies it was justoff the veggies were plentiful  unlike what other reviewers have experienced so maybe theyre working on veggie portion size  there was plenty of rice  very plain but edible service was nice and attentive i wish them luck but dont think they will be around long and doubt i would visit again overall edible and extra star given because veggies were fresh and crisp and service was good iced tea was good as well|they may have changed the sign out front but its still tokyoto sushi same staff and chefs same menu instead of ayce i usually opt for a la carte or lunch specials the lettuce wrap app is as close to a riceless roll as youll get here but they do allow you to order handrolls sans rice for an additional  eachlunch specials are on a separate menu even going during lunch this menu is not provided upon seating its also not provided when you ask for it i had to pull up their website menu on my phone before they brought over the lunch sushi combos list so i could order kind of irritating other than that and forgetting my beverage for the duration of my visit service was politethe lunch combo  is my favorite miso soup and two gyoza plus your choice of two special rolls from a limited list the given options are just okay most of them are shrimp tempura rolls the namesake omy roll and the aladdin roll are both fairly plain and the rice fell apart where sauces were used|the few people we talked to in person were nice but the lady on the phone was rude when someone calls saying your site isnt taking gift cards or debit cards dont get an attitude saying you dont care and nothing you can do|im reluctant to release this review but it looks like some have already let the cat out of the bag about rainbow promenade   i am diggin this remodel with the motorized plush recliners with foot rest  this is best thing to happen to theaters since popped popcorn  the chairs are sooo comfortable it was hard not to spend my entire day off work just lounging in this chair  now if i only had a remote control and a beer  wait they do serve beer in the concession area and some damn good ones like stone ipa never thought i would see the day now it becomes clear why the small popcorn is   for that price i could buy a popcorn farm  that is just ridiculous what the prices of movie theater snacks are these days  i think i will sneak my own in my ladies purse along with a  pack of brews  it is nice to have the options in case you forget i have never been a big movie goer but i might start because of amc promenade  only because of the big comfy couch like seating you gotta try this|the food is good but the service sucks they only gave me  napkins for four people and when you ask for more they give you an attitude i understand that as a business you have to save money but service comes first|updating my review on snooze previously we have a pretty poor experience after writing my review the manager asked me if i would try it one more time and we did both of my boys are under the age of two so when we bring them its a true test of the restaurant as well as a test of my patience  snooze did great they even catered to our need for special seating when you have a kid in a high chair and another in a car seat things get tricky when it comes to that ramon made sure our experience was excellent and it was thanks to him i ask the ham benedict which is what i got last time and it was great the hollandaise was on point and super filling my husband got the chillaques benedict and he loved it like really loved it i was only allowed one bite and that one bit was really good my  year son got the pancakes and he loved those as well the kids meals are actually pretty big it came with a pancake hash browns and fruit which was really great i had the local iced brew coffee and that was really tasty not too bitter which some cold brews can be that way my husband had a mocha which is his staple coffee and liked it as well we also sampled the gingerbread hot cocoa which was their special for the month and that was seriously good it tasted like cinnamon toast crunch and the gingerbread man had a baby yum yum yum so im thinking our visit previous to this one today just must have been an off day which happens to everyone its a busy restaurant and you cant expect perfection which such high volume i can now say this company takes pride in their staff customers and food we will definitely come back but maybe not at breakfast rush hour on a weekend  cheers to you snooze and thank you for making our breakfast great today|very good food decent pricing my girls and i enjoyed a nice brunch here |hamburgers were good the french fries are great this place is a great concept that has great potential ordered a double char with cheese with all the fixings burger is prepared one temperature they dont ask the concept is an obvious play on innout but the burgers are not an innout burger simple menu quality food  spent  for lunch for double burger fries and drink comes highly recommended|food wanted to check out the yakitori places here in las vegas and hachi has been a great experience thus far the bbqs were good the pork belly and the squid were good choices we also ordered some ala carte food on the menu and those turned out great as wellambiance the location is great for social drinking with finger foods to orderservice service was great they accommodated my family with  small children and were attentive to our needsoverall would definitely come back for the yakitori grills|good pizza friendly staff beer is very solid and the guest taps cover any hole in their offerings pizza is  kids pizza is about  and half price service was a bit on the slow side for beer and pizza|dajuan is an awesome waiter he was very attentive and his service was impeccable i will definitely return|so ive been here twice and the service was consistent very attentive kind staff and ownership that seems very concerned with your satisfaction however the food was not quite as consistent the first time i went i had a frittata and cajun bacon the frittata was borderline uneatable crunchy on the outsides and mushy on the inside with huge soggy pieces of mushrooms the cajun bacon was equally difficult to consume it had soooo much seasoning that it literally hurt my tongue the wheat bread with my frittata was good so i was able to hide a piece of bacon in there and was able to salvage some sense of satisfactionmy second attempt with bakn was much more enjoyable after my first experience i decided to go with a safer approach and opted for the breakfast sandwich and it was fantastic one of the best that ive ever hadill have to give this place a few more tries but itll be hard to stray from the breakfast sammy| stars for the donuts only i kept hearing how good this place was and i will agree it is but they have a major issue the staff sucks we stood at the counter for  min while  employees ignored us while trying to figure out some piece of equipment once we were finally helped it was clear that the person taking our order had a very limited understanding of the english language this caused my order needing to be repeated several times ending up incorrect and having extra items added i would say the one thing you should make sure someone working the counter at any business can do is speak and understand the native language oh and the coffee tasted like it was pissed out of someone who had had drank coffee earlier that morning if you go here be prepared for shit service if the girls working when i went are still employed here stars for the staff and coffee stars for the donuts|fantastic server  wish i remembered his name he was quite knowledgeable attentive minus fussiness and had a great command of their extensive menu food in one word adequate my boyfriend and i came here with paella on our minds first we split a potatoeggham appetizer that was a great portion for sharing but slightly unbalanced too much runny egg not enough ham and potatoes were undercooked  next came the paella  we ordered the valenciana to split roasted rabbit shrimp mussels clams chorizocherry tomatoes sarvecchio bomba rice aioli  it was beautiful but i hate to say it rather flavorless  it didnt have that deliciously delicate saffron taste one finds in really good paella or really any spicegarlicsalt flavor to speak of  it tasted like rice and meat the other thing i wasnt too keen on was the chorizo used it was overcooked to the point of being somewhat rubbery yet still crispy a possibility i didnt know existed prior to dining at estrellon the aioli which i thought id mix in to my portion to amp up the flavor was bizarre again no flavor tasted almost exactly like cream and really gloppyrunny  as for the decor the dining room is palatial sure but the art on the walls is rather offputting  i think they were going for a cheeky spanish popart kind of thing but it didnt fit and seemed like something id pick up at tj maxx not a big deal obviously but it exemplified the general tone of the whole experience which is this could be really great but somethings just not right|for under  you get to build youre on pita like chipotle except you they offer to grill items which is awesome you can grill meats and veggies etcfor  people it was about  so its not bad i love the idea of paying less and being more full personally but if you arent a pig like me and love pitas this place is easily for you|nestled in a cute little enclave the location is great you wouldnt know how big it is by the looks of it from the outside this place is in the center of a college town so you definitely get the college crowd but i was surprised to see an older crowd there as well craft beer options were great we ordered a couple appetizers and had a few beers bratwurst were great service was good though we had a little trouble finding the bartender a couple timesoverall this place is pretty solid if i can find a babysitter again ill definitely be back|i got my henna done here yesterday the staff is really nice and were very welcoming mrs neelam did my henna and did a fabulous job free handing however i was washing my hands today after about  hours and residue started to come off it stained quite well but i was wondering whats going on and if that is ok or if somethings wrong i dont want the henna to fade quickly especially since my design was so elaborate|my wife and i always pass by this place and so today was the day we finally stopped by and gave it a shot first thing we noticed is how clean and neat the joint was we were immediately greeted at the door at the entrance there is also a chalkboard showing their specials for the day our waiter came and took our drink orders you must get the orange juice there are many places that claim that they have fresh squeezed oj but this orange juice here is the real deal for our food orders i went with the philly skillet and my wife ordered the birthday pancake my skillet was really delicious  eggs made to order over a bed of nicely seasoned home potatoes i say nicely seasoned because they werent too salt like other places the pieces of steak were very tender overall i really have nothing negative to say about the delicious skillet the birthday pancake looks and tastes exactly like what you think it would funfetti batter strawberries and raspberry drizzled on top with whip cream on top i was thinking this pancake would be a bit too sweet but it was surprisingly not the pancakes are big no measly baby flap jacks here im glad that my wife and i gave this place business because we will be coming back quick review service is fast and tentative food portions are good for the price orange juice is really hand squeezed the potatoes arent rolled in msg and salt|frosting was shocking shocking because i did not expect it to be the most amazing buttercream frosting i have ever had this was the frosting on the spice cupcake also bought a peppermint whoopie pie it was amazing not just because chocolate and peppermint but because of how soft the frosting filling was how chewy and perfect the cookies were and how nonhard the chocolate it was dipped in was the only reason it gets  instead of  stars was because the coffee sucked but seriously awesome baked things|i had such an amazing night at vue  we had a large party and staff were quick to accommodate all of us when we arrived i was taken aback by the view of course just gorgeous it was hard to take my eyes off the giant windows which display the city perfectly our waitress was great  very sweet girl who handled our large party well we shared the hummus plate which was delicious my friends and i shared a bottle of wine which was reasonably priced osso bucco entree was delicious  packed with savory flavor the meat literally fell off the bone i didnt even touch my knife to it once asparagus was fresh and cooked to perfection the risotto which accompanied my meal was excellent as well  cheesy and creamy i couldnt wait to eat my leftovers and i cant wait to come back to this new restaurant|looking for something different this was at the top of the list on yelp i totally enjoyed the chicken corn chowder and may come back and get some more before getting on the road it was so delicious we bought a salad but was filled up on the soup hubby enjoyed his  bean vegetable chili the kale  banana smoothie was very healthy tasting so i may try the strawberry  spinach next time it was a pleasant first time experience|i really like coming here because it right next to my office  the staff is always friendly no matter how busy they get my orders have always been correct and tastythe only issues i have are the drive thur line isnt laid out very well  when it gets busy people trying to leave are blocked in by people trying to use the drive thru  people that just picked up their orders are also blocked in by people trying to use the drive thru  it seems that if they rerouted the drive thru to use the back of the parking lot to access the drive thru then it would free up the regular spots for everyone else that wants to walk into the store  this morning i saw the line backed up to the entrance of the shopping center  if the drive thru was rerouted this issue could have been avoided  i will still keep coming here because its convenient but only when the line isnt backed up to the entranceim not sure if its a starbucks issue or the property manager but the drive thru line needs to be fixed  it will make life easier for everyone that comes to starbucks jersey mikes or supercuts|madisons coolest coffee bar i drove by this spot on my way to milwaukee one day and knew i needed to stop in sometime well a few days later i made sure to stop they have a room that looks like it used to be a vault  it even has the vault door included i heard that they may do karaoke in that room in the near future aside from that room there is a diner feel to the bar that serves the coffee and a third cozy room with spots to sit the overall coffee section is well lit with daylight assuming its not another gray sky day in madisonthey have many options painted on the side of the wall and a menu for those that like to browse i ordered a large americano to go and explored while they made it in the back which was closed there appeared to be a bar and restaurant that looked very inviting i need to stop back at night i feel like it has an entirely different personalitythe coffee was good definitely woke me up nothing special about the cup but who cares what it looks like  its merely a vessel for that coffee goodness the staff was also very friendly and looked like they could be or are friends outside of work too|the ambiance the food and the assistant waiter was great however the main waiter red coat captain was terrible took him almost  minutes to even address the table and bring us a glass of water we had our wine before the water from the sommelier once we received our food we very seldom saw him when we need something we had to ask the assistant |i do not understand all the hate on the other reviewsit costs about the same as chipotle but there are a bunch of fun extras  you get free chips and salsa with any order you can get discounts depending on the day of the week and i love their queso  they also have several items on the menu more in the style of taco bell crunchwraps and things but with better quality ingredientslike any burrito place you have to try the different proteins and figure out what you like  at chipotle i love the chicken or the sofritas  at moes its the steak or the pork  but they also have some options you cant get at other burrito places like fish and ground beefmoes is definitely worthwhile  its not more amazing than any other burrito place but the chips and salsa is a great touch  its enough to make it my goto|the service was good but their food is not impressive i have had a lot better and the prices are kinda high dont order the queso it was cream cheese and it was |great food first time i was here the waiter was informative about their social nights the following experience was not so great the waitress ariana dropped the ice cold water on me apologized but left and didnt come back had to wait until i got another waitress attention in order to get help smhdidnt even bother to comped a drink or ask how she can make things better smh|weve been waiting patiently for this place to open and finally went for dinner first the staff was all so helpful and kind our server was so pleasant and answered all of our many questions she took the time to briefly explain all of the cocktails and wine to us so we could make a great choice i also loved the coat check they had at the host stand the person who seemed to be the manager came around at the end to check on us and ask about our meal and it was appreciated second i loved the inside of the space its small but comfortable i appreciate the bar area without stools where you are free to stand and have a drink and small plate a lot of great little touches on the decor and presentation last the food i cannot even list everything we ordered because with four people we ordered about  smaller options and then two large plates and shared everything some favorite small options were the crab and tarragon churros the bacalao and the jamon croquetas everything we had was good and full of flavor the only reason i gave  stars is that i dont feel like im racing to make another reservation we tried a good portion of the menu pretty much everything that sounded delicious to us and it was good but id love to see how often the menu will change or have rotating items to go back for new things|they have a listful of beer selections i went with the sampler  choices of beer for  and all of them were so goodalso got the cheese curds and fries which goes well with the beer the most thing i like about the place is their atmosphere among the top choices to hang out with friends|my wife and i went the the madison location  the beer selection is outstanding but could afford to provide more local madison options  the bruschetta was delicious  it came with the goat cheese toppedcrostini encircling a wellseasoned salad of grape tomatoes marinated in italian spices  it was all drizzled with a delicious balsamic vinegar  the dish was presented beautifully but the tomatoes were prepared in advance and intentionally served cold  i would have preferred the entire dish to be warm   overall a great dish but the  price tag is something to considermain courses  i had the cafe burger with regular fries she the smokey burger with sweet potato fries  while both were cooked to a perfect mediumwell and had excellent flavor the slab of white cheddar on my burger was not melted at all  it was literally a chunk of cheese on top of a burger  dare i say i would have been content with  slab of cheese that was melted  the wifes sweet potato fries came out cold and soggy as if theyd been sitting for awhile  she mentioned this to the waitress who was more than happy to comp a cone of fresh fries and  dipping sauces  almost seemed as this was something that had happened before  when the new order of fries were brought they were great  while the food was fine it must be noted that the server rachel i think was fantastic  she was incredibly helpful and friendly throughout the meal  truly a great server|pizza is great the crust is nice and crispy the cheese is fresh and not greezy the toppings are good the beer is cold and they have a full bar with craftmicrobrews and good prices ill be back soonpsthe wings are great pizza wings beer good things|after hearing about this place i finally had the chance to try it and i gotta say im not all that impressed we came on sunday afternoon and was seated quickly as it wasnt crowded yet our server was great he was quick to getting drinks and our orders my first thought while waiting was oh great they serve nice large bowls for the price it was only then after getting our meals my ratings went down for the place i had ordered the tonkotsu ramen with additional chasyu roasted pork and tampopo original spicy pastefirst look into the bowl i see it is only half full of broth next was that even with additional pork there was a total of  slices i was expecting the normal bowl to already include  slices since the description says there are slices of roasted pork plural therefor i should have at least  slices total also each slice was  fat what a waste of  the extra  for the tampopo original spicy paste is also a joke smelling the paste i instantly thought of the spicy korean paste you can buy at the asian markets lb tub for about  it was given to me on the side in a little oz condiment cup with maybe about  tea spoon of the paste and charged me a dollar for thatoverall my experience wasnt too bad the ramen was cooked nicely and the flavor was good but the pricing is what really gets me i think they need to do some price adjustments if they expect more repeat customersside note heard last night some elderly woman ran her car into the restaurant and will be closed for a few weeks i hope everyone is not harmed and have a good christmas|cant say the good is bad but definitely not wow eithera friend of mine went some time ago and had the unidon and loved it so i was hoping to try it unfortunately when i went  it was no longer availablehad a sashimi appetizer and honestly  the fish wasnt that great also took some fried chicken and it lacked flavoras a main dish i took the salmon chirashi and it tasted blend there was some sauce in the rice but was tasteless it consisted on salmon sashimi  salmon tataki et tartare there was only  reviews for this restaurant and all were i really dont get it|fresh fish and amazing location cant wait to come back all you can eat is a reasonably priced|extremely good food the feta fries where the best the steak  was well marinated and juicy i liked one of the side condiments that was a little spicy not sure what its called i want everyone to try this place out so the business thrives|went out looking for a place to watch the gb game on sunday sjs just opened recently lets check it outill give it  stars for now i didnt try any food all i could see on the menu was fried fried fried and of course burgers the waitress recommended the flat bread maybe next timeservice was slow our waitress seemed new didnt quite know what was behind the bar but she was attentive after she got rollingone thing i will say this place is uber clean i could drop my food on the floor and could pick it up again it almost sparkled that is the main reason ill be back to try the pool tables and food see you soon|solid  round it up to dont get the southern collard greens  it is unusually bitter  portion is big enough for sharing but the taste is badshrimp poboy the batter is good and the bread is toasted right  there are few shrimps in it  the cut fries are big portion  so a lot of carbs not a lot of meatnothing amazing or special that makes me want to come back|chicken is reaaaaaaallly good the people are really friendly too also free delivery within  miles awesome|my friend and i came here for dinner last night overall the staff was very polite and personable they checked on us often im not exactly sure who the server was because two people seemed to be taking care of us at different times while confusing it was a great to see the staff working as a team because we were well taken care of so and never had to wait for the serverthe restaurant is beautiful and i really liked the open layout of the restaurant and the dark wood tables the open kitchen takes up about half of the space the womens restroom was very clean however it reminded me of a fast food bathroom with the red tile floornow onto the food and drinks the cocktails were appropriately titled from elf the movie eg santa i know him they came quickly and were delicious we ordered two appetizers the crab hush puppies and the shrimp stuffed avocados you must try the hush puppies the sauce was delightful although we wished for more spice the puppies themselves were flavorful crisp on the outside and cooked to perfection the avocado on the other hand was not stuffed the shrimp and salsa was situated next to a grilled half avocado which was a bit unripe the shrimp and salsa did not have much flavor i wouldnt recommend thisentree wise we ordered the asparagus baguette and the shrimp and grits i loved the baguette there was a wonderful jam on the sandwich that really complimented the feta and grilled asparagus it came with crispy fries on the side the shrimp and grits were flavorful but not what we were expecting the grits tasted like over seasoned warm cornbread batter and the shrimp were tough and overcooked for dessert we had both the blueberry cobbler and the smores they were served beautifully in tiny cast iron skillets the cobbler was topped off with fresh vanilla ice cream although it didnt have a crumbly crust it had fragrant lemon undertones that packed a punch it was lovely the smores was not so great the first layer was melted chocolate the second layer was a graham cereal topped with huge toasted marshmallows it was hard to eat because the marshmallows were not melted and the cereal seemed stale in the melted chocolate it sounded great but it just didnt workoverall everything was a hit or miss i will definitely be back the burgers looked amazing and the staff was great|went to palazzo and was shocked to find that zine had closed and this placed opened in its place  apparently they renovated it maybe a slight make over but it still looks roughly the same  we went and had a late night am meal and found the place emptyambiance  brightly lit and decent decor  the restaurant appears more open than before like i mentioned pretty empty at amservice  since we were the only one there it was pretty good  hostess explained the menu and stated that  of zines menu was the same  the rest was a new asianhongkongfusion type of offering  waiter came right away and took our drink orders  food came out quite fast  overall service was decentfood  we went with the basic fried rice a crispy egg noodle and a wonton soup  the soup wasnt terribly hot one of my pet peeves but had decent flavor  the crispy noodle was something that i had never had and i thought it was interesting  i would probably order the pan fried noodles or chow mein next time  the fried rice was on point  good flavor and lots of meatvalue  because it is located in palazzo this place is terribly over priced  almost  for fried rice is a terrible rip off  but hey when you need or want food at am you cant be choosy|wow what a awesome spot super speakeasy vibe and great cocktails its all under ground so if youre a little claustrophobic this may not be the place for you  but i loved it my husband i are big fans of valley bar which is an undergroundspeakeasyish bar in downtown phoenix and this is very similar its a very hip yet casual and welcoming place lighting is low music is loud and the drinks are tasty what more could you want you take stairs to get down to the bar which is guarded by a door man i felt like i was going to some eliteforbidden place which made me like it even more the back story of this place is pretty cool too but i wont ruin it for you i have been hoping downtown chandler would start to bring in some new hip places into the area and this seems like a great step forward for the city my husband had a whiskey ginger and bullet was this well whiskey at the time which is pretty impressive he said it was made just right you can tell this place take a lot of pride in their cocktails and it shows but take note if your not a fan of loud areas you may want to reconsider because this place got really loud at times thanks for the yummy cocktails and fun atmosphere|i went here right after it opened and thought it was adorable  its very inexpensive for basic things or you can ramp it up and get fancier sushi rolls wraps flatbreads etc  you may want to get two things if youre there for lunch because the portions are more snacksize or maybe my appetite was just bigger than usual  i recommend the pretzel roll  it comes with chopsticks and is very fun to eat  its just a quirky little place thats fun to visit with friends or family and the food is cute and good|ate here for the first time today theyve been open about four weeks overall we liked it  i had the lobster tacos which were served with a mango  fruit and they were very good my daughters steak empanadas were excellent   husband had the carne asada tacos the meat was good but the taco itself was a little dryneeded some green salsa or something the rice and beans came with some kind of sour cream drizzle on them which was not mentioned on the menu but the staff was nice enough to replace them with plain ones  the papas were hot both in temperature and taste  husband thought they had too much chili powder  reuben the manager is a really nice guy and was very receptive to our feedback which included a suggestion to be able to mix and match tacos  they promote themselves as a taco shop but did not have very many kinds of tacos  overall it was a very good lunch and we will definitely go back|marginal overpriced sammies  for mine pressed on a george foreman go to subway for a third the money or stop at screamers on hey  for the best burgers and shakes in tow|went back to try again on a warmer day tacos were still excellent and it was much nicer to eat and not be freezing lol|tried the house ramen and mochiko chicken for a side and was very tasty to say the least good flavor overall even if its more on the bland side i wouldnt want to compare to other ramen places in town but for a place thats brand new and still working out their kinks on the menu its a good menu it should only get better|do you love boba what about star wars come on down dont get the connection come find outchris v put this spot on my radar by saying this was the only place so far to offer both sea salt cream and mini boba and they do both exceptionally well i daresay i enjoyed their sea salt coffee better than that other spot in townmacarons are the only edible currently available outside of various beverages shipped in and refrigerated not made on site havent tried them myself to make a judgement but theyre cute enough to mentioni love the logo and product enough to be tempted to buy a company tshirt on my first visit you will be too|great service would have given  stars but since you were out of fries i was forced to get onion rings no big deal until you charged me  extra per meal for the onion rings i dont feel like we should have been charged on something that was out of our control|i saw the menu before heading over and thought the price was for a smaller size burrito but when i bought  of them and tried them at home they only had one ingredient wrapped in tortilla i thought they would have at least cheese in them i feel like these were getting close to those dollar burritos not a type of burrito that i was thinking about and wont be craving them anytime soon and they close very early|this was my first visit to a cafe zupas and i have to say it is decent for what it isi wasnt in love with my panini and neither was my mom so i will probably steer clear of those in the future and just stick to regular sandwiches soups and saladsmy mushroom bisque was delightful creamy and rich with the right amount of mushrooms i would come back just for soup when im in the mood againthe only thing i didnt care for was the restaurant layout all the chairs ere huddled so closely together it made it pretty difficult for people to navigate around the restaurant since there was no clear path to the ordering line trash or drink station everyone kept bumping into one another and it became quite irksome since they just recently opened im sure these are small tweaks that can be made to improve as they learn the staff is all very new as well and it was slightly more difficult to order than it shouldve been given the fact that i had to repeat my order three separate times as i moved down the line might be a little easier if i could just say it once and someone could write it down not too hard for ordering one item but when i was trying to remember what everyone in my party wanted every time i had to repeat the entire order it became harder to recall with each subsequent interaction otherwise a decent quick eat spot for bites on the go|so i noticed some fellow yelpers checking in here and since it just down the street from me just had to try it  i love deli food and the thought of another good deli near me was too much to pass up on  we each got a soup and sandwich combo and a couple of salads i had the turkey bacon avocado with the wild mushroom soup  the wife got the bbq pork with the lobster bisque and the daughter got the crab sandwich with the cauliflower soup   the wild mushroom was very good  creamy and with those amazing tasty mushrooms  it was exactly what i expected  the turkey bacon avocado sandwich was also very good  the bread was still crisp and the turkey and bacon were pretty tasty  it had a decent amount of avocado which was prefect as it added to the overall taste but didnt turn the sandwich into a mushy mess  i did try the lobster bisque and cauliflower soups and they were both very good  the lobster bisque was chunky with more lobster than i expected  i would definitely order it again  the cauliflower soup was creamy and surprisingly delicious  i did not think i was going to like it but hey you just never know sometimes  i did get  taste of the crab sandwich and it was pretty good too and would gladly order it again  i didnt try the bbq pork sandwich but according to the wife it was nothing to write home about  she said it was ok  we got the mango and asian chicken salads and although they were good i dont think they are a good value so i will stick with soup and sandwiches next time      since they had just recently opened i am not sure if the inside was done but it had a very casual feel to it  i would call it modern industrial but hey i am no designer so not sure what they are going for as far as looks  the staff was super friendly but too plentiful  i would assume this is due to recently opening and doing ojt with new employees  i ill be back but wait a month or so to see how this place matures  a good addition to rainbow and the sw of vegas|ive rarely had issues with this location outside the extremely long lines however if im here at pm when its relatively quiet and i order a double espresso it shouldnt come to me cold really dont even know how that happensthe staff is friendly here though and the location is great it tends to get dirty in here quickly with trash on the floor and patrons not picking up after themselves|this place is no frills but the food is delicious must try the lemongrass tofu with rice downfall is cash only|still my favorite place to get a burger in the city of pittsburgh its the atmosphere the bar the servers or bartenders everybody inside who works here makes it worth going out for food and a few drinks even w changes over the last few years tessaros won my business a long time ago and has kept it  bacon blue burger medium wa guinness and the steamed veggies  my usual|best wedding soup togo in the city good barpickup servicenever was a regular diner in the restaurant but as i remember the food was good not memorable but filling and great if you go w friends or family|absolutely amazing we tried around four things on the menu the food is very fresh will definitely be coming back|wonderful location minutes walk from the center of uptown and other venues such as the boa stadium right next to the light rail so super convenient to get where ever you need to be the interior is of the hotel is quite good though is getting a little dated the bed is very comfortable and the linen was clean and crisp the rooms size was okay and the bathroom was on the small side the bathroom light was quite dim but shower pressure and soaps was also very good wifi was quite fast and reasonable for the price i had a room facing uptown and the westin had very large windows allowing me to look out of the beautiful skyline i will definitely be back|i always forget about jersey mikes in uptown because its not in the over street mall area this location is found in the citizen bank building its super busy on tuesdays because they run their  lunch special regular sub chips  drink but the service has always been super fast my go to choice the the  turkey and cheese all the way with banana peppers added wondering what all the way means well its lettuce onion tomato pepper salt oilvinegar and special seasoning it tastes awesome they also have a bunch of different sandwiches to pick from additionally jersey mikes doesnt skimp on the toppings every time ive been here they load up the meat theres a good amount on your sub so you wont leave disappointed|so it has probably been more then  maybe  years since i have been to connollys so all i can say is if you are looking to be young ago in your s and enjoy being crammed in a small space bumped by everyone around you and cheap drinks this is your spot we were out after dinner hitting some spots and decided to stop in and i know why i havent been in so long the place was so packed you cannot even here yourself think here anything anyone around you are saying and the drinks werent that great not my thing maybe i am just too old|pretty cool to take the kids there for a day to have fun learning|went for the menudo the best part about it was the freshness and cleanliness of the dish however the serving was barely enough other menudo specialty restaurants serve a bottomless bowl for  cents less and its usually as good or better tastingthe service at rositas is the worst when we arrived it took a few minutes for the waitress to arrive she brought  forks  knife and chips and salsa no water  she left and returned about  minutes later with pad and pen in hand she asked us what we wanted to drink and my daughter ordered a soft drink and i ordered a chelada  i also asked for waters  she asked my daughter what she wanted to order my daughter asked me if we are ready and the waitress told my daughter you order now  we ordered  several minutes later we got our drinks and  glass of water  the chelada tasted more like a bloody mary and i only drank   the food arrived and our order was right my daughter had a beef chimichanga with rice and beans over priced at  but the flavors were outstanding especially the beans and rice  as mentioned earlier the menudo was fantastic but the portion left me wanting moreas we were eating i called across the room for an order of pozole to go  my waitress replied from across the room let me check  she did not ask me if i wanted red or white beef or pork and flour or corn tortillas  yet when she brought me the to go bag i asked if it was red and if she included flour tortilla  she replied they only sell red and she put flour tortilla as i had requested again i hadnt been offered a choice  when my wife ate the pozole she discovered the tortillas were corn also the pozole had only  pieces of meat and the hominy was hardfinally the check was scibbled and illegible i was charged  for  bowls of basically soup  a fried burrito with beans and rice and a beer and sodai wouldnt mind paying  if the pozole had been as good as the menudo  theyd have a better chance of my return business or recommendation to others if portions were larger i had a difficult time tipping as much as  for the horrible service that came with bottomless bowl of attitude|i stayed at the royal palms for one night was supposed to stay  the property itself was beautiful decorated nicely for christmas the staff valet brandon and front desk clerk were excellent  very professional and kind both gave a nice overview of the property and amenities the room itself however  felt worn out the carpet was in bad shape the bed was too high to climb into the bathtub was odd also couldnt get into that and you have to consider all of the extra charges all in all i spent  for one nights stay you are charged if you leave early the property is iconic though the staff was nice and the grounds were beautiful|i went there to change my break pads they asked me to do couple of more stuff i chose to skip the break fluid change the price was good bad part is that i had to wait for  hours and  minutes because they first got a spare that didnt fit and had to go back to find the right one again wish they gave a proper estimated wait time so i would have chosen to drop it off|so i had called this prl store in search of a specific piece a man by the name of david answered the phone and to be honest i had too many questions about shipping and returns to the point where i was annoying myself but david kept polite and professional i had the best possible outcome he found exactly what i was looking for and placed it on hold for me told me to go in and ask for taylor and he would help me out i walked in and was welcomed politely by a lady i asked her for taylor and she insisted that she was able to help i told her my situation and she said that she didnt know what i was talking about she ran around the store looking for the piece when i had told her it was on hold she kept saying that they didnt have such a piece she went behind the counter and without really looking she said it wasnt there taylor comes to the counter to assist her and wahhlaahh he goes behind the counter and right next to her theres bags of items placed on hold from other people including mines as wellif i wouldnt of encountered this female associate that was rude and not helpful at all this wouldve been a five review do to david and taylor thanks polo for david and taylor|the food was pretty darn good but too much styrofoam is being used styrofoam plates and cups plastic utensils that stuff is lousy for the environment it takes like bazillion years for it to get into the water system|if you need a great workout i will definitely recommend the new hiit classes with terri and shari tuesdays tabata  with jeanette is my favorite class too|look this is just another car wash  nothing fancy so it bugs the crap outta me when i see owners knitpicking the towel personnel about a water droplet here or a smudge there its a dang  car wash deal with it unless youre paying  for a complete detail lighten up on the towel guys ok i feel better nowthat being said if the government ever declares open season on windshield repair guys im packing my supersoaker and heading up to az auto wash god those guys are annoying they just dont stop even after youve told them to bugger off i have suggested to the management of this place that they really need to develop a dimesized little sticker that we can put on our windshield or maybe rear window that the windshield guys will see and know they are not free to accost us cuz heres the deal when my windshield is busted ill let you knowis this a great car wash nodo they get the job done sureis the staff friendly yeah for the most partdoes this place do windshield repair yupdo i wish a hummer would run over the windshield guy before i get there definitely|probably the best rueben i have ever had the morning star is definitely in an odd place but well worth finding great staff and really good food|slow service seems like they arent in any hurry  waited right by the barrista while others came and went  finally looked and my drink was sitting there  never heard him call my name whipped cream completely melted other than that the drink was fine|amazing location since its right by my school and has cheap prices that are perfect for a college budget the spicy korean chicken bowl with broccolimy goto|there are associates all throughout the store to answer questions some better than others as far as a hardware store goes i think this place is pretty good i rarely go alone and my boyfriend doesnt really need much help but its nice to know that they are there just in case we have the occasional question|okay so im just gonna keep this review short either the service is really good or it really sucks there hasnt been a between for me|usually make it to this location after attending gracie jiu jitsu class up the street  love the smoothie and flatbread combo which is my go to  try the detox island green and chicken pesto flatbread for a quick healthy snack  location is quite convenient for this busy area and plenty of other restaurants and shops in the shopping center  ive been to other locations in town including flamingo and decatur and jones and  and they are all pretty consistent with their food and smoothies  nice selection of wraps sandwiches and flatbreads but having the same ones too often does get quite boring so switch it up a bit  the detox island green is naturally sweetened with spinach kale mango pineapple banana  fresh ginger  ive had the mango magic which is quite refreshing if youre a mango lover  the grilled chicken on brioche looks quite delicious so ill be trying one next time|recently dined here for my abuelas th birthday the customer service was great  they put up with my crazy family and no one complained about my family either which was good because i could tell some people were getting annoyed with my grandma having our waiter take a billion photos of us hah the food was delicious i would come back in a heartbeat if my family wanted to|omgthis place can really get me in trouble good think im not super close to it my mom and i were in this shopping center after finalizing our car insurance with statefarm and we ran into this outleti really feel like the grocery stores including walmart are ripping us off when it comes to bread bagels etc i found bread and bagels for  i also found things that wouldnt normally be found in a typical grocery store i really could have gone nuts here but i had to have self control and know that i will be coming back to by other thingsim hooked on this place  |the food is okay nothing special or to write home about  it does get busy at night  im not sure if it is due to the fact that the locals or everybody else thinks it is good or if it is due to the fact that everywhere else was closed at pm while pho kim long is  hours  anyways we did had somewhat of a nice moment when miss vietnam was bum rushed by a bunch of vietnamese diners for handshakes in the restaurant|craving for pho and saw this on yelp so we came here  we were seated right away upon arrival  service is friendly  ordered special pho and rare meat pho  we also ordered fried chinese donut   hot coffee with condense milk   bought to go stirred fried rice noodle and beef  food was average good  restaurant looks relatively clean and spacious  plenty of parking in this plaza  price is average as well|normal kbbq restaurant i love how cheap the food is but i hated the service starting off with the food everything was pretty tasty we tried the brisket marinated ribeye and short ribs the brisket was my favorite even though the cut of meats were uneven some perfectly thin but not too thin other a little thick so even though the meat was grilled it was chewy the ribeye and short ribs were okay theyre on the sweet side so i liked cutting through the sweetness with a bit of kimchi my least favorite was the short ribs too sweet and not the best meat ive ever had for the price of all the food though plus like  sides  is a price you just cant beat oh and definitely get that salad tasty stuff man people are right when they say the salad is really good moving onto the service however i just really felt bad for the older woman serving us she was literally serving the entire restaurant there were two other workers that i saw who would clean up dishes and man the cash register but other than that the older woman was taking care of the entire restaurant no wonder the service was bad and slow  it was a busy night even at pm so be prepared to wait in all price is good for the food you get but be prepared to wait and also have somewhat slow service|i used to know a girl who worked here and ive been in a few times but tonight i decided to go all out with some of my boys but didnt expect to end up at cheetahs just was over at the rhino and it was popping wish i couldve taken some pics for yall|the store is clean and well organized easy to find everything the reason i come here is they usually have a different sale going on all the time with large signs clearly postedi cant review without mentioning the same thing everyone else has experienced when you walk in youd expect a welcome to hp or what can i help you with sorry not here if you are lucky the staff will look up at you then go back to their conversations with other employees been here a handful of times its always the same one time a kid did acknowldege me he must have been new havent seen him since he must have been making the other guys look badi have tried to have conversations with the staff asking what they recommend or just general questions answers are always slightly condescending or unhelpfulbottom line come here if you know what you need and know what you want to spend youll get more customer service from a computer screen|ive been going here to see sadie for about  years now and she is amazing she has a lot of patience and really explains everything thouroughly she also has a genuine care and concern for you as a person not just another patient in and out the door the wait time is on and off some appointments ive waited almost an hour and others its right on time the staff ive noticed has a lot of turnaround because i never see the same nursesreception staff twice i had an appointment today and the receptionist tried to tell me i didnt even though it was confirmed twice ahead of time but she ended up finding the appointment anyway the gals at check out didnt seem very friendly and there was a line to check out but nobody at the desk for almost  minutes also the check out area is a little small and not very private so your business becomes everyones all in all i still love coming here the building is very nice offices are always immaculate and very modern would recommend|pretty standard old time pittsburgh place the food is about what youd expect but a little expensive for what you get i liked their fries and homemade ranch dressing i did not like the fact that they use miracle whip on their club sandwich miracle whip probably should never be used instead of mayonnaise at a restaurant it kind of crosses a boundary if you ask me also the decor is weird they use fake bricks and trees for the walls i will say that they make one hell of a pie|i was here a while ago but i wanted to post a review because i still remember my experience the food was really good and the staff was amazing my father drove us in one of his garage cars the kind that he doesnt drive too often and everyone wanted to take a picture of it and it loosened up everyones mood we were sat by the kitchen but it wasnt noisy or disruptive the only issue i had it was a bit dark i also took a tour by myself of the upstairs to go to the bathroom and it has that quaint old house feel because it is one the bathroom door had a cool foot opener too so i didnt have to use my clean hands to open the door apparently the place is supposed to be haunted so that also added to the allure|hit or miss on food i went back a few times if you go during a busy time food may not be done well on slow days the food is on point overall this is probably as good as you can get in charlotte doable|i do love this store although it can be really slow moving in the lines any who you can buy anything from any where most of the time you get something you wish you didnt this time i got some hawaiian kettle style chips not what i expected because theyre really no different then cape cod chips but the more i eat them the more i fall in love with them no too salty so you dont need a big glass of water there just right great with a turkey sandwich|a great place to go in sweats eat your weight in vegetarian chili mac and not be bothered i love it|had a piece of double chocolate cake at manas coffee house in pineville that las delicias provides omg talk about chocolate heaven the smells were so rich and the taste was just right not too overwhelming with richness but just right i cant wait to try their other offerings|some good pizza and they are open late which helps for late night munchies the taco stix are worth trying alsoi believe it to be better than the regular papa johns or little caesars by a long shot|closest grocery store to my house i dont like to buy the fruits and veggies here too often because a lot of time its it doesnt look fresh but everything is good|its pretty damn good i sent my vintage peacoat to get tailored because there was a problem with the sleeves they gave me a time to pick it up and was able to fulfill this order at that time when i tried it back they had done a really good job they had lengthened the sleeves perfectly however they had not slimmed it as much as i wanted this could have been due to my own fault in not telling them what i wanted but i believe when i was asked how slim i wanted it was going to be snug around the sweater that i was currently wearing at the time even though it is not as slim as i wanted it is still a huge improvement to what it was before and now i can actually wear the peacoat without looking like a child in his fathers jacket|the food here is absolutely amazing they rotate in some seasonal items and have an overall very nice selection of breakfast items soups sandwiches and salads the bread is also absolutely amazing and is worth the trip in itself the bakery items are also delicious  ive never been less than pleased with anything ive gotten here my only complaint is sometimes the service isnt great at times the staff can seem a bit cranky|omgoodness i loved their food the chicken was so good and the waffles were ok they could have been softer i would come back again if i am in the area|steve helped us touch up some picture frames  hes a trooper  really appreciated his attention and care for detail in helping us tonight|in a bad part of town a little ghetto and old rides from s but kids have fun|its a nice laundry mat but theyre lacking customer service i called prior to going there to see if they were busy the lady that answered the phone was rude  her answer to my question was were always busy i then asked if they were busy right this second and she was rude yet again|my husband and i really enjoy coming here hes been eating at hoosiers since middle school and it hasnt lost its touch ts very nostalgic for him its a great local breakfast and brunch and not pricey at all the  eggs options on their menu is a great bang for your buck option|i have a  bedroom renovated unit and have lived here for about  months i paid  with the month free overall the unit itself is  not top of line but not bad either thats fine id rather have my rent cheaper im paying for location you are right in the center of old town here and all it has to offer sure theres the bars but lots of other cool stuff the civic center mall is across the street with tons of fountains grocery stores coffee shops this location really is unbeatable if you are a fan of walking lifestyle im a young professional moved here from the east coast this year i started out renting in sunscape that place is nice but it has a ton of vacation renters many of my neighbors were retirees and i wanted a place that was walkable and better socially but not pay an arm and a legi give the maintenance staff a  every request ive submitted through the online portal has been given prompt attention i have to say im impressed with that and i love i can do everything onlinefrom what i gather palladium seems to do a better job than other complexes in hosting parties and events especially during pool season there hasnt been much lately unfortunately i missed the holiday party because i was out of town i hope they have another event soon as i was looking forward to meeting more of my neighbors negativesthe biggest negative is the lease structure it really sucks that if you dont give them  days notice your rent  jumps up like  that is astronomical i understand paying more for month to month but thats insane its almost doubling the rent other places arent like that im probably going to have to move out for that reason alone since id like to buy a place in the next  years so im going to need that flexibility if not for the lease structure id give  stars in a second maybe even  why do you have to go out of your way to structure a gotcha lease to fleece people as they are on their way out just increase the regular rent it makes no sensei also find the way billing works to be confusing its hard to figure out how much you owe when you are distributing the rent credit because they dont help you with that i wish that was a little more seamless final thought the views  one of the reasons i moved to az was the scenery from top of the parking garage is an awesome panoramic view of the valley its spectacular i wish there was a place to hang out up there or another part of the building on the roof|i really liked our visit here minus the steakhouse the town is cute and really beautiful at christmas  santa and the soap bubble snowfall and the lights and little stores are all very nice i also like that they have plenty for the little ones to do from the log ride like bull ride to the train to the hay ride to the horse rides to the petting zoo and beyond there is lots to doand for a  wrist band it is well worth it my only complaint is the very limited operating hours  fsun three days only and only very limits hours we didnt get to do everything we wants to do because they were closing early on sunday i would recommend going right when they open that way you will have time to do most of what you want to do ps dont try to call this place they dont answer their phones or return phone calls|had a black and blue burger with the super garlicky fries  burgers and fries are in point  nice selection of beer good casual atmosphere to hang out with friends after work|went here today in search of some coney island food like i used to have back home in michigan that was my mistake nothing is like home but gave this place a shot anyway i had a coney dog and chilli cheese fries everything tasted okay but the chilli had beans in it which clashed with the fries it wasnt much cheese on the fries the beef hot dog was good and it did have a snap to it i just wish the chilli would have been a little spicier overall it was fine but you dont get much for the price|my wife and i celebrated our th anniversary at the house we have eaten there before and have decided it is our go to place for special occasions our server was attentive friendly and well versed in the preparation of various menu selections our meals  oz steak and texas wild boar enchiladas were excellent as were the beef enchilada soup and shaved brussels sprout and beet salad which we shared we passed on dessert due to being full from our meals but several of them sounded yummy when our server described them my only disappointment was the noise level it was quite noisy in the small room we were in but that was due to some large groups of diners enjoying holiday party cheer its not been a problem other times weve dined there highly recommended for events you want to be memorable|came here with my wife during happy hour to celebrate closing on our house  we really enjoyed it  the tables and seats are dated and probably need to be replaced but we kind of like dive bars  this really isnt a dive bar but the booths more adequately belong in one  we got there a little after  and it was busy but still got a table booth  parking is always a bit hairy down there but after circling the lot a few times a few spots opened up  we had a bunch of oysters and were extremely happy  i havent had good oysters in az so i was very happy to taste freshness and get real horseradish to put on them  we ordered a couple more apps and took full advantage of the happy hour  off apps  we do like fried pickles but these ones are spears and we both prefer the fried pickle wheels  the hummus was good and it had a kick to it which we like  really want to come back  hopefully we have a similar experience  oh and the service was excellent from the lady we had|nothing special havent been there in a while the food is decent but nothing to rave about one of my friends claims she got food poisoning from the fish tacos the margaritas are good but other than that the food is pretty standard and so is the service|although i have not been attending central most of the year i really love their christmas service it is quite a large production with acrobats the famous rapper music and snow falling jud always delivers a funny and meaningful message this year seemed to be a little less of a concert than last year but still very enjoyable my one complaint is as with the regular services the music was just way way too loud you couldnt even hear some of the singers the music was so loud this is definately not a traditional church which has its good and bad points|came for dim sum on a tuesday morning at am the place was pretty empty but by  they were packed and already utilizing the side rooms to seat guests also noted that the signs near the door stated that the restaurant opened at  am earlier than what is listed on yelpoverall food was good service was hit or miss some servers were great others werent responsive at all the congee cart specifically took more than  minutes and multiple requests to the other servers and hostess before we got our dishes needless to say there were certain members of the party that really wanted congee id recommend sitting near the double happiness sign for best service as all the carts come out from there they were constantly coming out with new freshly cooked hand made dishes our favorites included the shumai pork ribblets and the shrimp balls fried and steamed only complaint foodwise was that a few of the other balls and shrimp dumplings had too much corn starch and not enough meata little pricier than what were used to back in michigan might be due to tax but would come back again|came here for the first time and the food was great the servers were so kind i got the breakfast burrito and it was very good had a nice kick to it i also tried my brothers sweet cream pancake and it was so fluffy overall great place for families and great food|had a great suite on a th floor corner loved it we ignored the time share people we didnt eat at the buffet because yelp made us reservations and they didnt accept them plus the fact that you had to stand in line to pay and then stand in line to get seated we went to the american bar and grill and had a much better dinner tv in the bathroom didnt work there were some lights out and this morning instead of getting to sleep in there was construction work above us sounded like the plumbing lines above were being snaked nothing like a lot of noise|dont leave anything in the room  you probably wont get it back   i accidentally left a few necklaces hanging on the door in the room in the hustle and bustle of checking out  check out is  am  i called a few times to see if my things were turned in  nope  some untrustworthy maid got a few great necklaces for future wear  we are diamond owners and this is very unappealing for future stays these are the same people that came in our room with all of our belongings at bay when we were out and about  yikes|i just returned this afternoon from a three night stay at excaliburit was my th visit here but my first in three yearsthere is a lot to like about excalibur despite the three star rating so i will certainly be back but there were a few concerns that popped up on this visit that resulted in a lost staron the positive side there are two things that make excalibur an ideal choice among hotels on the stripfirst they always have the best prices whenever i have checked prices on various sites comparing hotels on the strip they have the best deals among the more mainstream hotelssecond they are located perfectly for easy access to other hotels luxor new york new york mandalay bay tropicana and mgm are all within a  minute walk or tram ride the hotels along along the  south central strip are also within about a  minute walkin short excaliburs location provides for the most convenient access among the greatest number of hotels in the shortest timei have also found the atmosphere of the hotel to be quite festive with friendly and helpful employees a diverse food court and a buffet that is above average compared to others i have tried i am also bias because i enjoy the medieval atmosphereyet as much as i would like to give at least four stars there are a few reasons why i could not on this last visitfirst the water pressure in the shower was the weakest i have ever experienced in any hotel i also felt unsafe in the shower it is spacious but no handles or rails to hold on to inside i would have been in trouble had i slippedsecond the heater in my room   had a continuous intermittent loud vibration sound that was quite annoying and something i had never experienced anywhere previously it was difficult to stay asleepmost surprising was my visit to the sherwood forest bar this was the first time i played the video poker machines anywhere in vegas and i had to pay for my drinkthe employee said  the drink is not comped as he charged  me  for my johnny appleseed cider a wonderful and highly personable concierge named anacelia also thought this was unusual and offered to have me email her expressing this concern and even offered to have me speak to a supervisor i declined her invitation but i was greatly impressed with the great customer service from anaceliaanother employee at this bar later told me that not all drinks are comped darn i almost got a budweiser i wonder if it would have matteredat any rate i will definitely return and hope i can give at least four stars next timeexcalibur is just too friendly and convenient for me not to return|got to take pictures with stars  great fun especially when you see your favorite celebrityas soon as you enter you would think wow vegas brings out the starsfrom celebrities forgotten to time memorial to stars that you wouldnt know existed from the present age this wax parlor displays people you would think are real until you feel their lifeless texture there was an interactive part of this museum with a halloween theme when we were there mainly people jumping out to scare you and the wax figures were not up to par as the rest outside that was a bit of a disappointment but as you leave the museum you could take a picture with a wax figure of obama in a replica of oval office this is a place my wife and i loved to visit the first time we were in vegas but not a place you would go again hence the four star rating happy yelping|cheap steaks and a buck for a beer during football games|always visit here for glasses when in vegas good selection pricey but usually have some type of promotion running can be slow to generate rx lenses as optometrist is not always on site but once processed things go quickly have reliably shipped multiple pairs of glasses to my out of state home address|went there for the breakfast buffet as i read that there was a chinese twist to it its wrong except for the chinese fried rice and lychees in the fruit section but the food was good and the bar tender very friendly|food was good but the attitude of the restaurant was bad we ordered dosas ad then asked for extra sambar the new sambar was totally different from the earlier one and was very watery on top of it they did not tell us that this would be charged extra in the final bill they charged  for each cup of sambar this is ridiculous you should inform the customer when you serve them and not try to make money this way when we complained regarding the quality and not being told they took it off the bill to the restaurant staff do not do this again please inform the customer when you serve|been here many many times i think i have ordered just about everything from their menu haha but my favorite has to be the steak burrito and the chicken bacon salad is coming closethis place is clean and the employees are nice and attentive ive never had to take my food back because they messed up my order i will continue coming here|wife and i eat out a lot both on and off the strip and knowing the strip prices are generally higherthis place does indeed offer a spectacular view and i found service to be very good although tables are too tight together for the prices they charge wine prices are rather ridiculously high i paid  for half bottle of average ca cabi eat escargot all over the world and this was one of  the worst visually it looked good but far too much fufu around the tiny snails very little garlic taste and served warm  my error in not turning it back immediately my venison was cooked correctly and tastes very good my wifes filet was more medium than mr  which she had asked for sides were excellent in taste but way overpriced for the small portionsouffle was excellent|everyone seemed friendly husband had no appointment and they said at least  hours the only issue i had was its  out side but they has it freezing inside i had to go wait in the car with the heater on so i could warm back up|went inside to see what is on the menu since this was my first visit luckily it was tuesday  for three tacos had to try that since i hadnt eaten anything all day it tasted great kind of thrown together but the shell was crispy and good still even when i got home the filling was tasty the ingredients fresh and crunchy nice polite fellow behind the counter  i visited the one on sahara i never go to fast food places ever but this was so close to my apt i broke my own rule  glad i did beats cookin and cleaning up a messy frying pan ill go again if i get a hankering for tacos|from came to this barnes and noble to pick up a gift card as a xmas gift this location is like any other barnes and noble full of books a starbucks and stuff the store is set up good and things are pretty easy to find without assistance|from we needed to take a shopping break and grab some food so to the claim jumper we went this place is huge there is plenty of seating available which is good i am sure this place gets packedour server who was very much on top of things in spite of being busy with other customers she took our orders i got a calzone with spinach and mushrooms it took a bit of time for our food to come out again i think its because they were busyonce we got our food i dug in my impression of the food was okay just a bit bland for a calzone and sauce but it wasnt bad just needed garlicnext time come back i have a different entree|from we came in for some holiday items this pier one is located on w charleston blvd with a ton of shops in the plaza surrounding it the set up in here is nice and the store is big you can spend a bunch of time just looking at all the knickknacks which is fine with me also the staff here is very helpfuli love pier one and you cant go wrong in any of its stores|great location in town square mall good lunch prices the rolls are also a fair price we really love the sukiyaki ramen and any noodle you always get plenty of food|enjoyed ordering sashimi option instead of sushi rice  very fast service with many of my favorites including oysters on half shell uni soft shell crabs ama ebi sweet shrimp hamachi kama and all the regulars  wish they opened for lunch|always fantastic beer and great food consistently a good time and wellworth stopping in no matter what day of week great bar to cozy up to and friendly bar staff|this place is home to one of my favorite pittsburgh delicacies the sushi spring roll called ssr from here on theres nothing remarkable about the restaurant otherwise my  star review rides solely on the back of this magical little treat its basically a fried piece of heaven like forserious theyre so good they were probably made by jesus himself on the outside it looks like any other spring roll but once you bite in a journey begins you go through four flavor stages by eating the ssr first a crispy little exterior mixed with the delicious sweet sauce they come with second a mix of perfectly cooked rice and veggiesnext the sushi comes to play finally like captain planet the ingredients all combine to form a supertastyhappytimeasian flavorgasm enjoy|its been a while since i visited red square and yet their dumplings made such an impression that i check every time im in vegas to see if they made it back on the menu everything else was good but not memorable those dumplings thoughout of this world|the burger bar epitomizes great food treated carelessly on one hand the flavor profile of the baguette burger was one of the tastiest ive ever had and the patty itself was absolutely perfect on the other hand there were so many ways in which the cooks could have made the concept shine but failed to execute the burger could have been the best ive ever had if the cooks didnt fumble the pass the bread was not toasted well and had a store bought quality to it the burgerbun did not fit well together so eating was very messy the arugula was not flavorful  and the brie chunk was too thick and didnt cover the burger either the sweet potato fries were bland the whipped cream was delicious but the milkshake itself was not particularly thrilling the real low of the burger bar is the ambiance everything from the tables to the mismatched silverware to the fact that the booths are filled with tvs that the wait staff cannot turn off make the burger bar feel like an airport restaurant the staff were friendly but seemed checked out to the point where i kept waiting for them to make a mistake|despite having tasty pizza and excellent service once we were seated my experience waiting to be seated was enough to warrant only three stars first off this restaurant doesnt accept reservations which is fine but if you dont accept reservations and have a  minute wait time on a tuesday evening you should probably provide some sort of seating for waiting guests we were told to go wait at the bar which is a nice idea in theory if you hadnt already filled the bar there was standing room only to wait and if i hadnt been there at the request of my sister i would have left rather than have to stand packed against other guests and in the way of servers it was all in all a claustrophobic and uncomfortable experience once we were finally seated my mood improved our server went above and beyond and almost helped me forget the fire hazard i had just escaped from the pizza was tasty i have lived in chicago and their stuffed crust or chicago deep dish did not disappoint|bellagio is beautiful no doubt customer service was great as a couple we saw many families kids it really made me miss my kids ouch the gambling area was pretty quiet for a saturday i heard no machines or people buzz with excitement we gambled every other few hours and nothing we went to mgm and caesars and their machines kept us entertained we didnt feel the night life vibe at bellagio shopping was rich so you have to be super rich or like getting in debt to shop here we chose to eat outside from here oh and yes like reviews the bed was uncomfortable to soft for my taste|stayed in a clevel suite  the suite was really nice  ok viewbut great bathroom with jet stream tub jack and jill bathroom and vanity area  it was huge  the separate bathroom was awesome  i had mixed feelings about the bidet thoughlol  there was a cool pop up tv in the bedroom the only thing that i was surprised by was that the room did not have a coffee maker weird  also the room was not serviced one of the days which was odd   there is a great countrystyle restaurant called the pantry in the hotel  i highly recommend their allamerican breakfast  do not buy anything in their convenience shop  it is way to overpriced  the casino was cool  they had some really cool dealersoverall  great clevel suite  friendly casino dealersrecommendation  stay  youll have a good time|the lines and the prices here are rough the girls are hot for sure but if you want to pay twenty bucks for a beer then be my guest i think now were headed over to the sapphire to see how cool that is i get that the alcohol is where they make most of their money but holly hell thats a lot of loot to spend for a bottle of beer|we spent about hrs watching the circuit mma finals we had a blast drinks were limited and only overpriced snacks were offered  the crowd was awesome after the fight mgm did not look like they were prepared for such a large crowd great night|we stayed with some friends that lived out of town and had a timeshare here  although the dcor seemed a little outdated the rooms were pretty spacious  we were in a room that had a separate room off the living roomthe kitchen was nice with all the appliances cookware and utensils as home  we saved money and bought food at the convenience store downstairsthe cool thing is its connected to the cosmopolitan hotel and you can use all their facilities  pool gym etci hope our friends invite us to stay with them again soon|im sad to be giving this place only  stars because the food and drinks were ahmazing i got the croque madame and shared oysters and mussels with my friends croque madame was cooked excellently and the bechamel sauce drizzled on top was creamy and delicious mussels were very good as well and the portion was huge dip the bread they provide in the mussel sauce goes well together now for the reason for  stars my friend got a bloody mary and saw a cockroach running across the make your own bloody mary bar not only is this unsanitary but also ruins your appetite by causing us to question the cleanliness of the restaurant the manager did come by and apologize and offered dessert on the house so they definitely get points for service however still unacceptable to have little roaches running around in a nice las vegas restaurant |every time we have guests we make it a point to bring them here especially for breakfastits conveniently located right on the stripgreat selection of delicious food with a nice atmosphereservice is friendly but sometimes there is a short wait because many others want to eat here  hopefully we will be back soon|came here for my birthday when i made a reservation they asked if it was a special occasion and i said it was my birthday food here is really good and service is also good was disappointed though because i requested to sit outside to watch the water show and when sat they told me the patio was closed they should of either told me that when making reservation or called and told me because that was one reason i went there they also dont do anything for birthdays which is bad for such a fancy restaurant espically when your paying alot for dinner least they could do is buy you a  dollar dessert|my friend and i wanted to do a quick brunch before leaving vegas and came across this creperie a little tucked away but so cute and fits well into the paris theme so this place serves some of the best crepes i have ever tried i had the roasted chicken crepe ask for extra pesto  and my friend got the breakfast crepe mine was cooked perfectly there were so many different flavor a going on and the pesto added the perfect touch to this already rich crepe my friends crepe was ok why she kept stealing mine hehe i wouldve given this place five stars except service was not good the lady at the register seemed irritated and was not polite i think maybe eating one of these delicious sweet crepes may help her|i like grand lux cafe  its a solid restaurant  their menu options are vast so i really think the experience can vary based on what you order  first of all the restaurant is located right on the casino floor of the venetian  we sat right in the front balcony area which can be exciting but not recommended if youre sensitive to cigarette smoke  after a while all the smoke made our eyes water so i would advise a table in the interior of the restaurant if youre smokeadversei ordered the sunday night pasta on a sunday night  the portion was generous always a plus  the meat sauce had beef short rib steak mushrooms and other seasonings  my test for pasta is i can usually polish off an entire entree if it is really really good  with this pasta i found the meat sauce to be on the heavy side  the spaghettini was all right but on a whole the entree did not wow me as it did in some of the other reviews  i ate about half my plate  my wife got the zen noodle soup  i tasted it  not recommended  probably should have known better than to order an asian noodle dish hereto be clear theres like a hundred other things on the menu we didnt try  i intend to come back and try something new|overall it was just ok for  i would have expected that they didnt run out of certain types of sushi at  pm the sushi selection was pretty weak the meat quality was very good and other dishes and dim sum were enjoyable overall the food was decent but not worth  dollars for  people|the wynn brunch buffet is a very good buffet  we waited in line for about  minutes at  pm on a saturday to get in  as you get to the front of the line you see this beautiful foyer with elaborate decorations hanging from the ceiling  quite a sight  we didnt get to sit in the foyer but they sat us literally right next to the food so no complaints here  our waitress was so nice and attentive  it was greatthe food is quite good for a brunch  i really liked the cocktail shrimps  the dim sum dishes were on point  the chinese porridge was excellent  sushi was decent  they had big ol beef ribs prime rib turkey although i didnt fill myself up on the heavy meats  as far as breakfast foods go theres pretty much anything you can dream of  desserts options are aplenty and decadent as wellbut i saved the best part for last  at around  pm when we were beyond stuffed we found out they were changing out the food stations for dinner  out comes the fresh crab legs  we promptly got second in line for those suckers and it wasnt long before that line exploded  they also brought out lamb chops but i was dying by that point  i have never stayed at a buffet long enough for the stations to change shows you want a total glutton i am|beautiful huge brunch buffet on monday for the holiday atmosphere was amazing got there at  am and waited for  minutes  dollars selection was great service was great i loved the chinese porridge smoked salmon desserts pancake station and carving stationspork belly what great selection of breakfast and lunch however for the price there was no crab legs no champagne boo for the price we think we can do better|this  buffet was awesome   many different types of food to choose from  american  asian  italian  etc i was really excited about the all you can eat crab legs   our waiter was really courteous and made us feel welcomed  we got complimentary mimosas so that was nice  the dessert section was great as well  id definitely go back |it was a buffet we had a  for  coupon so im not disappointment  the crab legs were small great selection  of  food  i enjoyed the pasta to order it was an ordinary buffet at a reasonable  price|i wasnt too sure about this place being that there are to many disappointing bbq restaurants i am used to having great bbq and soul food home cooked never had to go out to a restaurant  for this goodness but now that i live in vegas with it only being my boy friend and i it would be wayy too much to cook for just two people so my manager told me about this place she said she will have lucilles catered to our christmas party so my boy friend and i decided to give it a shot before then we service was nice very friendly but a too perky that didnt make me feel the southern hospitality i was looking for it made me feel more like i was in a laguna beach cafe but i must say the waitress was very helpful when it came to menu knowledge being that it was our first time at lucilles we ordered the full rack of baby back ribs with  sides and a side of hot link for the two sides we chose french fries and baked beans i liked the spicy flavor in the bakes beans although i didnt like that they were a little hard or under cooked the ribs were very tasty and fell off the bone the hot link was amazing reminded me of the hot links that are sold in my old hometown market oakwood i also liked the coat hanger at each booth we arrived at approx pm to the restaurant and was sat immediately due to no wait by time we ordered it was about  then i noticed happy hour started at pm there was a couple things my boyfriend and i wanted to try on the happy hour menu and the hostess was going over some of her favorites as well she said we just had to wait  mins and could order from that menu so i say okay cool then she comes back and says i am sorry but happy hour is only in the bar if you would like to order from that menu you would have to move and sit in the bar area i looked around we were comfy in our booth had our coats hanging drinks ordered and our waitress was coming with our food so no i didnt want to move but i feel like it was our first time there we werent offered the bar to begin with and after being told we would be able to order from the happy hour menu then told another i just feel like that was their mistake and they should have granted us a one time to order from that menugood thing is by time we were done eating we were pretty full and didnt want to stuff ourselves|came here for breakfast a few times every time has been just ok nothing great overpriced thats for sure easily  without beverage for some eggs and baconsausage with toast i dont mind spending on good food but eggs and toast is just eggs and toast anyway you make it i wouldnt recommend unless you just want the convenience of grabbing some pretty basic breakfasts right downstairs by the elevator|cute hole in the wall place  i got the traditional benny it was good but my only grip was the canadian bacon was super thick we are talking half an inchpancakes are super big and generous  delicious and just airy enoughbe sure to check in so you can get the yummy banana nut muffin|one of my favorite places for brunch excellent foodreally fun to sit and eat  at the bar overlooking the grills where all the food is prepared its dark inside and a small area but quite cozy and comfortable it really does feel like a hideaway|service is great the waiter was wonderful heart an appetizer it was way to pepper hot to eat they should warn people is going to burn their mouth off could not is anything afterwards im sure it is good to some people however they should warn you thats going to be absolutely pepper hot could not even eat the dish because of the heat index manager was kind enough to give me my money back however i thought the place was overpriced for the quality of the food|we got a table for two on a friday night with no wait the service was good and it was a nice atmosphere  my partner and i appreciated getting a table sized for four so we could sit cattycorner to each rather than across from one another we liked the bread especially the fried one the food i ordered something spaghettilike with pork jowls in it was extremely salty the butterscotch pudding was great|i came here for happy hour with a friend and enjoyed it ive heard good stuff about this place and was happy to say that i too was pleased with the food and drinks we ordered the butternut squash bruschetta  margarita flatbread which was good we sat at the bar and the bartender was attentive when we first arrived but forgot about us as the night continued my friend eventually got up to find our bartender so we could order another drink the bartenders were friendly though just slow overall its a super cute restaurant with tasty food and good drink specials for happy hour|tried this place for the foie gras appetizer it was good but not the best ever it was slightly over cooked i had the beef tenderloin with bone marrow for my entree it was cooked perfectly and the marrow was a nice compliment we had drinks at the bar before dinner the eleven mule was perfect ginger beer is house made the ambiance is my favorite part of this restaurant|i consider myself an oyster connoisseur  so while in vegas on business  i went searching for that amazing oyster bar  wellthis wasnt it  good pan roast and gumbo very delicious   but what i came foroysters were disgusting  we got the gold band  a dozen  and when i tried to eat them a weird secretion like snot was pouring out of each one  since i didnt want to get sick i didnt eat any  only giving a  star because of the cool location and rest of food  the oyster cook had the personality of plywood and the waitressserver wasnt any better  i felt as if i was in s texas  she was rushing  never smiled and just wanted to get us in and get us out  i guess it will be the harrahs oyster bar next time for me|cute restaurant im in love with their chicken pad thai crab rangoons were much better than most places you could actually see crab in them where most places it looks more like crab flavored cream cheese service was great the bathroom needed to be cleaner|hate to pile on but the food here is very good quality everything was hot if you want a good lunch or brunch for  bucks and free drinks this will work for you|pros the portions match the price point therefore come hungry  haha food is of quality and the atmosphere is nice while the service isnt completely catering to the customer it is still good and they will come to you once you call them over cons first of all this is totally opinionated so make your own judgement on the following statements i was not as intrigued by the flavor combinations ive ordered my three dishes pad thai spicy string beach chicken and panang curry at many thai restaurants  and this restaurant has to have my least favorite in flavoring it was very under seasoned for me personally all i rated in the panang curry was coconut milk whereas other places i get a more fragrant herbal smell and overpowering taste also the chicken was completely over cooked i had to chew on it like it was bubblegum as of returning this restaurant goes on my maybe list because it is out of my way and i wasnt  satisfied|cant get enough of the chicken pad thai and an ice cold thai tea customer service is a bit short of what i expect but the food is delicious|always a nice time seeing the christmas lights with my family we go every year last year tea cups flew off of the carousel when two adults were spinning in it we all got up the courage to ride it this year despite the episode this year as we were leaving a parking lot man was screaming at us from  yards to get out of the road this was at pm at night when there were not any cars on the road it was extremely rude and made us feel unwelcomed i actually yelled back at him there is no where to go we have strollers my family all started laughing calling me a badass as one of my family members was assisting my  year old grandma w a cane and i was pushing two infant twins in a stroller and my other family members had strollers as well there were no sidewalks and nowhere to go very very rude you are just a parking lot guy calm down other than that lights are always nice fires are great santa is always a big hit and the musical x mas tree is great just tell your parking guy to calm the heck down its christmas for heavens sake|its a saturday night  youre not looking to drop a ton of cash but you want to go somewhere with great food and great atmosphere  so many options but where should you go  that place is nolan kitcheni went here a few days ago  when i walked in the place had a lively vibe  it was pm and there were a ton of large parties having dinner  it was a little loud but as people started leaving after the wine bottles were empty it was much quieterthe waitress assigned to my table was very nice  didnt hover too much but did come back to check on us periodically throughout the meal  she also didnt rush us out of the table which was really great and relaxingthe food was pretty solid  i know everyone raves about the zucchini chips but i would put them at a solid ok  the short rib pasta was the winner for sure  not heavy like you would imagine a short rib dish to be but packed with flavor  a must get  chicken piccata was also light and a nicehere is what you can find at nolan kitchen  mostly neighborhood people from their s and s so youre getting the i go out one night a week and this is it crowd who are enjoying some drinks with friends without acting ridiculous  perfect if youre looking for a moderate priced restaurant for a group birthday party or a couples date where you wont fuss about splitting the check down the middle because the prices arent outrageous|good place to get plantains yucca and everything else|i give red rock  stars which rounds up to  on yelpim writing this review on my second night of our four night stay i booked our stay via living social so we got a great price per night in addition to some resort credit and vouchers red rock is away from the strip quaint classy and family friendly it is the type of hotel you go to for a getaway not for vegas hangover stylea couple positive things stood out to me very clean casino the casino area doesnt have the casinocigarette smell room serviceamenities are reasonably priced even standard rooms come with a very nice deep soaking tub easy to walk whole resortim pretty happy with our stay but i am taking away  stars for overall experience because i called the front desk from my room and the hold time was about  minutes spa was closed for renovation when i visited but there was no mention of this on the website in the weeks preceding our visit the spa facilities were part of the reason i booked this hotel its a long walk to your room from the elevators they place the hotel elevators at one end of the hotel since the hotel is very long and narrow it means that youll have a long walk if your room is not immediately next to the elevators|stopped here for breakfast this morning and was totally satisfied  i got the colorado omelet and raspberry pancakes and service was good  good for a family breakfast|i was a bit disappointed by this place my friend loved the oyster bar at the palace station and highly raved about the pan roast he said they waited almost an hour to get a seat there at am so i decided to check this place out with him and although this location is a lot bigger there was hardly anyone at prime lunch time we sat ourselves at the bar there was an empty glass with used up lime just lying around but we assumed someone will take care of it once we sat downnope not the case at all there was only one guy taking orders and cooking he saw us but didnt acknowledge us for the longest time we had to flag down another waitress who gave us water but had to call that guy over to take our order we decided to share a bowl of clam chowder and the muchtalkedabout pan roast and so he rings it up and gives us plates and utensils my knife was super dirty it still had dried up food remains on it gross we watched this guy cook while chatting with other customers as well as bussing overall it just seemed very unsanitary the way he was throwing plates in the sink and not washing his hands before going back to cook we got the bread basket butter was super bland i dont know how thats possible so i dipped it into the clam chowder the soup was very rich and creamy which i did like it was actually one of the better clam chowders ive had in a while the pan roast was not the same pan roast as my friend got at the other location apparently this was the everything pan roast with all kinds of seafood stacked to one side a scoop of rice to the other side all soaked in a tomatoy sauce the presentation was pretty sloppy yelp the other oyster bar and youll see the photos look totally different although i did like a lot of the seafood in this pan roast my friend said the other one was more flavorful dont get me wrong it wasnt bad it just wasnt amazing boo to my friend who overhyped it haha|fresh salad great bread and turkey sandwich  but the spaghetti was they delivered under an hour to the rv park and the driver was friendly thanks|i have been going to salernos for years but finally got around to writing a review in my opinion the restaurant can be hit or miss and usually miss with the service recently to me salernos is an arizona version of chicago style pizza the pizzas are sometimes super greasy which is not like what youd get at a chicago style pizza place they also dont have a deep dishthick crust pizza that youd find in chicago at like lou malnatis or giordanos that being said their pizza is still one of my favorite chicago style in arizona the one huge complaint i have about the restaurant is that the ventilation sucks you end up smelling like the restaurant for the rest of the day unless you change your clothes or shower|beautiful place to see the nutcracker easy access to seats and parking the orange carpeting and seats leave something to be desired large well lit place makes for amazing sound one of my favorite places to see anything|we had as install a backyard mister system no complaints about the actual work or product however we purchased a remote control to be able to turn the mister on and off as told us they had issues with their current remotes and were ordering new ones six months later we still dont have one we have called several times and always get runaround still waiting for units to come in in process of delivering to other users who were waiting ahead of us etc not once has as called us directly to give us an update nor do they seem to care that we paid for something that we havent received|the hieroglyphic trail is a nice halfday hike up a canyon with a stream small pools and some hieroglyphs at the end  quite popular on the day we went so you will likely see plenty of other people many bringing their dogs along  parking lot at trailhead is very big so you should have no trouble parking no charge  its fairly rocky in places and so may be too difficult for those not used to hiking  kids should love it  their is option of doing some further scrambling at the end of the trail for those so inclined  be sure to bring water|i must say that dominos has stepped up their game just picked up two pizzas pepperoni sausage and jalapeos was the bomb great flavor all around no skimping on the jalapeos either|ive lived here since july and love it  the pros quiet community fun part of town with quick access to shoppingrestaurantsfreeway reasonable rent great layout of apartment i have the  bedroom with kitchen island quick response from maintenance ice maker in freezer  cons no assigned parking i have to request pest control every month they cant just put me on the schedule  yes ive had a few critters but the pest control keeps it to a bare minimum the trash dumpstercompactor situation is horrible its always overflowing a few times this summer the pool was closed with no note or reason why  my last con is that the person who helped me move in is no longer working here i understand turnover but im  years old moving into my own place after a divorce  she made me feel so welcome  at home  now i walk into the office and no one knows who i am just disappointingeven though i may have more cons than pros listed i really do like living here  im very happy|we visited south point for a family get together its a great family friendly resort and unlike most strip resorts very manageable in size for older parents to navigate the resort is located between the m hotel and mandalay bay hotel and sports a western themethe hotel is clean the rooms well maintained and well appointed especially for the pricecasino is modest in size but they have the latest slots and its never too crowded table minimums are lowa great resort for all ages|i love this location especially now that they have self check out it realllllly came in handy today when it was busy due to christmas a lot of people were waiting in line and i waited probably  minutes just to check myself out and i still had a cart full of items and was finished before a few of them so happy to have this location close to home|from this is one of the better targts ive seen since moving to vegas the store is a good size with everything you would expect from a targt except it has a wider selection|battery cable connection broke a diy under  final price  he came to the car location did repairs promptly options were a  to  hour wait at a shop or  over estimate for abel within the hour i paid the difference the work is guaranteed but better than that abel truly seems to care would recommend him and use him again|this is my goto place for mexican food the wait time is not too bad even when there are only  employees presentthe food is always up to par burritos taste like burritos quesadillas taste like quesadillas etc although the food is not absolutely amazing it all still tastes great there is also a complimentary salsa bar there is a huge menu with daily specials breakfast items and desserts as wellon my last visit here i had a chicken burrito plate which consisted of a chicken burrito a side of rice and a side of refried beans everything tasted like it was supposed to everything came nice and hot the amount of food for the value of the meal makes it a great buythere is not a lot of parking here but there is always some place to sit there is a  cent charge for any creditdebit cards as well this place is worth a visit for some goodquality mexican food|definately not the friendliest guy working here but it was quick  easy i had the  coupon on my phone which he gladly accepted there was no wait and he was done in about  minutes i just dont get the tips appreciated sign a  minute smog check and they need a tip|great starbucks location and the friendliest staff youll ever meet make your drink just how you want it and a good place to study |this is my go to work lunch meet up or carry out  hot good food  staff are amazingly friendly  good prices  quality place|dr maloney is great i came to her last octoberish when i was attending school and realized i couldnt read the board even from the second row in class and thankfully she helped me get my eyesight back this year i unfortunately let my pug break my wonderful black frames when i placed them on the bed for just a minute and she decided to sit on them i drove straight over and as it was over a year ago since i had them i was forced to buy new frames i currently have the worst insurance with no vision coverage and had to pay full price luckily they did have the same exact frames in stock and because i was paying in full i did get a discount which helps since i wasnt really planning on spending  on new glasses but accidents like my pug happen the other night i realized my glasses were just way too loose and needed an adjustment i have to be honest i think the receptionist went a little overboard on the adjusting but at least they arent falling off my face anymore i defiantly will be back in january for my annual eye exam after my new insurance kicks in |came to ocean one after some shopping it advertised  lunch menu i ordered the max lolli pop wings and my friend the sante fe tacos  my wings are delicious  had a nice smokey taste if that makes sense  i was a little bummed out i couldnt add fries but the order of wings actually filled me up my friend said the sante fe tacos were good ass well  came in the order with friesi will definitely be back for more wings|it is very easy to mail in service at burger joint especially when it is not particularly busy however z our server amanda was highly attentive and was genuinely engaged we got every question answered and treated us like vipsthe food was actually really good i had the bbq chicken burger and it was very moist with a robust flavor my father and i shared the cheetos coated onion rings which came recommended by amanda they were ofcourse amazing and after the horrible experience we had at laggasse stadium the night before i will definitely be recommending this spot for the next sports putting |i love love love this place the sushi is amazing my favorite is the san fransico roll and also the magic mountain very clean place the fish is always fresh the only thing i have with this place is that the soda can b really watery since they use pitchers to fill up the cups other than that no complaints servers are nice usually not always too attentive to me when i go but they get super packed so i get it as long as my sushi is good im good  probably the best sushi place in vegas|we ventured out to get some lunch and didnt want to stop at a chain restaurant we good get back home hubby pulled into the parking lot and i was skeptical when a patron was on the parking lot holding a dog and a couple was on the patio with a larger dogwe went on in the food was delicious i had the huge philly style cheesesteak sandwich and even liked the coleslaw hubby like the split pea soup the burger was so big he needed to take some of it to go the girls liked their food as well service was good i would visit again|went here on a whim one day for lunch and im so glad i did my friend and i happened to make it here during happy hour and the food service and atmosphere were all as great as id heard im not at all an expert on greekmediterranean food so i cant speak to its authenticity but my friend and i thoroughly enjoyed everything we tried we also each had plenty of leftovers believe the hype  this place has delicious food with great service|the good open  hours sandwiches taste great  we both had the thw chicken chiploethe set back was seems to be little chicken at the ends of the sandwicheswill still eat here again|great food and service  love the dozen oysters on the half shell special they are offering during december monthurs  just wish it was all year round|omg loved loved loved this place the service was a bit rough in the beginning however they ended up winning our love they sang happy birthday vegas style to my friend and gave  her free flan also they have bomb happy hour  margaritas and  tequila shots|we started with a seared scallop antipasti which was amazing the scallops were impeccably fresh and cooked to perfection we followed with a white truffle pasta and garganelli with porcini trifoliate the truffle pasta was simply prepared which allowed the truffles to shine through we ended with la fiorentinathe porterhouse for two see photowith porcini bernaise sauce it might be the best steak ive ever eaten perfectly seasoned and cooked just right it was tender juicy and intensely flavorfulso why am i subtracting one point mainly because of the wine service the list is extensive but stratospheric in price there are very few bottles priced under  the markup is steep to cite but one example the antinori tignanello  is listed at  but i can get it at kl wines here in la for  which equals a x retail markup anticipating this problem i took a bottle from my cellar only to be faced with a very steep  corkage fee turning from price to service they took my bottle away to open it somewhere out of sight why they brought it back and placed it at the farthest away point on the table so that we couldnt reach the bottle without getting up hence leaving the pouring in the wait staffs hands this is a pet peeve of mine as christopher hitchens put it this breathtaking act of rudeness  conveys a nonetoosubtle and mercenary message hurry up and order another bottlei brought it its my bottle i should decide when and how quickly it gets poured|one of the more reliable places to dine at tempe marketplace you actually get a decent full meal and you get what you expect mexican food ish whatever chipotle is that is what you get nothing fancy nothing too terrible and at the price you expect and i have to admit it fills you upits your typical fast food place but i do really enjoy chipotle and this location hasnt let me down yet there are other options in the mall but sometimes its the cheaper things you want and getting what you are expecting|not bad but overpriced quick down and dirty reviewdinner salad was good but smallgarlic pita was  for one small pitagyro plate was huge and was very tasty although the rice was bland and oilythe gyros seemed a bit burned and had a bit of a sour smell as they neared your face|good food nice atmosphere small cafe with hometown cuisine just a little higher priced|my mother  i have been here twice since september and have had great experiences my son  i came im august and that went well too  so this review is for  visits total since august  each time at various times of the day we were seated immediately staff had always been wonderful and prompt and our food amazing as expected the only hiccup was the st visit with my son he ordered a kids pizza and i ordered one of their salads because i love their salads but instead the server had accidentally entered in a flatbread small plate  i let the server know he left the flatbread on our table  let me know it was compd obviously and hed go place the salad order rush no biggie the flatbread had mushrooms  spinach  since i love both i tried it and it was so good i tracked down the server quickly  told him not to worry about ordering the salad i was fine with the flatbread  not to comp it it was a simple mistake that they went out of their way to correct  worked out in my favor because i ended up with something i wouldnt have tried normally but was so good my mom  i ordered it on our future visits lol along with avocado egg rolls omg and other apps and the manager came over  they compd it anyways so no issues there lol if im at the mall ill go to cpk any day over the other chain restaurant there  |the pizza was absolutely delicious and it tasted just like the pizza ive had in philadelphiathat being said my only concern was watching the cashier ring us up and then go to put flour on the cutting board to make our pizza without washing his hands im not one to get squeamish but dirty money and food dont mix|when we arrived on a sunday evening an older man greeted us at the door  i say greeted because i dont even think he made eye contact with us  instead he just grunted and said two then he dropped two menus off at the sushi bar and walked away okaaaaayyyyy  luckily the young waitresses who helped us were very pleasant and generally attentive the guys at the sushi bar werent very friendly but i assume they were focused on sushi rolling average sushi  nothing spectacular but good enough that i might return every once in a while  we tried three different rolls but to be honest they all started tasting the same  the jalapeno roll was our favorite the asu roll was okay but a little heavy on the crab  since happy hour is every day woo we started with the veggie tempura  for the price you get a rather large portion but it was very very bland  i dont think the tempura batter had any salt|first off james the bartender is awesome i mentioned being cold and he brought me a glass with hot water to warm my hands the dumplings should have been crispier but they were busy at the time still id rather wait a couple mins longer than have non crispy pot stickersas always lettuce wraps are great love the look mein and changs spicy chickenfan of the whiskey sour too|good to have classic carolina vinegarbased barbecue got the pulled pork and it was delicious didnt even need sauce it was so flavorful although the sauce was very good too side of mac  cheese was also excellent start corn muffins were fluffy and addicting price was a little steep for bbq but well worth it will return when im in the carolinas|simple option not many people know you but can come to hang and play some ping pong|i was so happy to check this place out this weekend its one of those kinds of places you notice tucked away on a side street and think looks so sweet for years but somehow the timing doesnt work out or you forget and time goes by without you trying it and then you do and its even better than youd mythologized it in your mind its not trendy its classic dim and warmly lit its perfect for romance or for any kind of happy soothing hangout its run by a family who make traditional mexican food lovingly and with care they serve small dishes that are kind of like casseroles and warm fresh corn tortillas which you fill with the cheesey goodness from the casseroles making fresh tacos  about two casseroles per person is perfect and if like us you just want to try the best of everything you can ask them to bring you a sampling of their most popular dishes saving you the trouble of deciding so you can focus on the delicious work of eating i really look forward to coming back|food was good but not excellent been to a similar place in nyc better than this oneprice was bit expensive for a sandwich their service and decorif its just a random restaurant i will give a  star but with all the hope i got from yelp i have to give a |i went to montreal a few weeks ago schwartz was no doubt on the top of my list of eats they did not disappoint i heard theres usually a long line up for their sandwiches but i think there were less people that day due to the rainy weather  the servers in the restaurant were friendly and humorous  the seating is a bit cramped the dcor is retro and you will most likely have to sit next to some strangers  however its all worth it the smoke meat sandwich was flavourful as expected and the bread was very fresh  it wouldnt be a place to go for a date but its fantastic for a quick bite when theres no line  if you are visiting montreal you should definitely make a stop here|just walking around the old port area and found modavieordered a lunch special lamb chops comes with soup and teaservice food environment service fantasticfood soup was so good and a waitress severed me some bread also pretty good but the lamb chops was not on the level of the soup could be better imoenvironment it was pretty noisy  even only few customers and i can barely hear the music price i hope they can do a better job with the lamb chops but i do like their service a lot|been coming here for years  always good quality food anything with the homemade sausage is a winner  recently been getting the pizza and myself and the kids love it  for the kids to say we want to go to julianos for the pizza says a lot  my only one small issue is service is sometimes a hit or miss  sometimes great other times all over the place never bad though  there is decent sized screen in view of pretty much every seat in the place  if you havent been yet its definitely worth a visit  youll be back|i used to go to this cinema years ago before they had the new imax theatre at that time the theatres were relatively small in size compared to other cinemas but it was adequate considering it was cheaper than other places as well ive recently gone back and experienced their new imax theatre i have to say it was amazing its what you would expect from an imax theatre the seats are very comfortable as well and the place was very clean an extra plus is their matinee prices an imax movie is  if you go before pm i think so if you want to save a buck and still have a great experience huge plus the same price for seniors at any time of the day any day of the week the only downside is that you cant buy your tickets online and no reserved seating hopefully itll come in the future|so the place is a bit run down but the sandwiches were tasty ill definitely go back its the kind of food you get craving for every so often|i bought a livingsocial deal for zapata and we ordered the fish tacos the portions of the food were huge the service was fast but average the price of the food is steep without the deal the fish tacos were average because i have tasted better fish tacos they do give you chips and salsa|this is an institution in ballantyne we love to come here for dinner  we also do takeout from here about once every two weeks  heres your warning four out of every five visits the to go menu is wrong either it is a missed item or something altogether not what you ordered just check your order before you leave|consistently tasty  wellworth any wait time and always perfectly cooked  i tend to stick with bacon as my only topping slightly well done crustgreat local spot that deserves your   order from spak brothers enough said  youll be back|it will be interesting to see whether they can hold on in light of all these newer reviews my  star rating is for the croissants which are the only thing that we consistently order well be back again and again even just for them|have had bad service here before because i dont speak fluent spanish but food is very good|returned a few weeks ago on a friday night service was great and food was cooked well had the same dish and the steak was tender and not too salty|great decor for the living room or bedroom but its a little pricey pretty much comparable to crate and barrel however this location doesnt offer any kitchen party or entertaining items at least not enough to my knowledge maybe a few select items its mostly living and bed decor|had to give it one more go after the owner messaged me i love to see a owner stick behind his restraunt and he came through it must of been a off night the last time i did not tell my server about my last issue or comped tab untill the end to really see if they fixed the issues and they did server was on point sushi was fresh will be back for sure|every time i get to edinburgh i make sure to treat myself to a tasty meal at time  thai  this last visit i ordered the house special with the prawn although it tasted fantastic a little on the small size for a main course  great place and friendly service|beautiful gardens for going for a walk to enjoy looking at all the different types of  plants they have plants from all over the world and lots of interesting displays of them the glass houses cost  to enter and are really interesting and i love the carnivorous plant displaysthe gardens is not a park and they have rules about not allowing dogs balls bikes or running head to inverleith park next door for those things they used to not allow picnics on the grass but now they seem to be ok with them the gift shop is a great place to pick up things for gardeners and nature lovers with some unusual gifts and plantsrecently they have started holding more events in the evenings in the gardens and gateway center and they hold courses in horticulture and related fieldsthe occasionally close due to high winds and the risk of branches falling but they publicise this on both facebook and twitter if this is the case|bruntsfield seems to be the chocolate mecca of edinburgh and coco of bruntsfield is another shop that doesnt disappoint i was gifted a box of lavender hot chocolate from this shop quite awhile ago and loved it but never really put two and two together until on a little prechristmas hop we popped our heads into cocothey truly put the art in artisan  the chocolates here are exquisite the boxes of single chocolates which i believe are hand painted would make a beautiful gift for most occasions and thankfully the taste ranks as high as the presentation my particular favourite so far is the honeycomb with the chilli chocolate coming in a close secondalongside the boxed chocolates you can purchase bars of chocolate with every flavour imaginable haggis spice and hot chocolate they come with a hefty price tag but its not unlike the other artisan chocolate shops in the area and its probably the most visually appealing of the bunch with a few diehard chocolate fans back home ill have to keep this place in my back pocket for birthday gifts etc as i was assured they travel well if youre in the area and have a sweet tooth its a definite one to pop on the list|its been a while since anybody has reviewed banana row and in that time i think theres been an upgrade of equipment we were very impressed with what was availablein terms of service the guy at the front desk didnt seem too interested simply greeting us with a hello and then telling us which practice room was ours and that was that if youre coming to do a practice session you do kind of want to get straight to it so this didnt bother us at all  it was the practice space equipment and cost per hour which was important to usit was  an hour for a duo the cost goes up dependent on the number of people because the room is bigger we would usually practice at home during the day but my current schedule doesnt allow this so often and we were cautious of bothering neighbours in the evening obviously if youre a big loud band you just cant practice at home so places like banana row are a necessity also the rooms are all soundproofed with that funny black foam on the walls which magically keeps all the noise in  we didnt hear a peep from any other bandswe will definitely be using banana row more often as it was great to have piece of mind when practicing and as a weekly thing it isnt too costly|first time going here and had the special   pounder for lunch i added fries and total was under  bucks pretty good deal the burger was really small and pretty tasty but it reminded me exactly of eating a burger king whopper but smaller the fries could have been very good but were soggy the service was friendly and fast but i dont think the food was good enough for me to come back|great experiencecame with a group of  very picky eaters everyones needs were accommodated from vegetarian to simple kids meals i ordered the queso crisp which was like a mexican pizza pretty large portion probably not meant for one person but sooo good not overly done taco selection is very diverse and obviously goooodnote for vegetarians rice is cooked in chicken stock and request light cheese for cheese enchiladasambience was great really good selection of drinks too|kind of a small floorplan and can get very crowded people hovering over you waiting for a vacant table not my idea of an enjoyable environment food is ok and restaurant was clean staff was friendly and helpful just need a bigger space|always happy with the gluten free pizza delivery is always in a descent time love all the choices of flavored crusts|excellent burgers we had the cheese burger and the turkey burger both were excellent the onion rings are the best ive ever had when you bite into them you get a bite  not the whole onion  service was very good and the manager checked on the tables to make sure customers were happy|i love this place much better then starbucks in my opinion the only reason i wont rate it five stars is because it is pricey and the staff are really nice but they talk to much|we are owners of hgvc and we enjoy staying there when we need the extra space when we meet our adult son this location hgvc at the flamingo is centrally located in the heart of the strip and is just located behind the flamingo casino on the strip parking can be a bit of a challenge because you have to park in the parking structure that is shared with the casino so we usually valet at  a night the rooms are not as fancy as the cosmpolitan which is where we usually stay but they have all the amenities that you needthe one bedroom suite has a full kitchen with full size refrigerator and coffee makerthe suite has a large bathtub that i love to soak in every night after a night of gambling there is a comfortable bed and a sofa bed  there is two large size tvs with hbo and you can rent dvds down in the lobbythere is a nice little store in the lobby they offer room service the pool and jacuzzi is not as fancy as the hotels but its cleanwe had the two bedroom so our son was actually given a studio suite right next doorthe rooms are not a joined except by a foyer so i wouldnt recommend that for small children but an adult child who comes in at  in the morning its perfect they have small but nice workout room and dry sauna and a small indoor jacuzziwe love the small quaint feel of the hgvc our valet jorge has been greeting us for years and you dont get that at a large casino|great room value  however  there is no little benefit to having a kitchenette with no dishes  and  per night extra for a coffee pot  quick trip to walmart   mr coffee for |for a monday night i honestly thought the wait might be a little shorter the last time i tried coming here the wait was over an hour long and i just didnt have the patience to wait that long because i was hangry this time we were quoted a wait of about  minutes which i was okay with ended up waiting a total of  hr mins we did ayce and the food came pretty quickly i was pleasantly surprised the sushi was delicious then the service changed and we had to wait about  mins for our server to come back around just to give us our check our table was obviously cleared and we were just sitting around waiting so i think it was pretty clear we were ready to leaveoverall sushi was great but if we arrived at pm and didnt leave until almost  i dont think ill be coming here too often|i recently went here after being away for a few years and i can definitely say that things have improved for one they have expanded and more than doubled the size of the space the restaurant has nice decor the staff also seem a lot more friendly i will definitely keep sunrise near the top of restaurants in maricopa for breakfast|so far i have only been here twice and may i say both times were very pleasant the lady whom i presume owns the establishment came off as very friendly as well as welcoming which makes for a better environment regarding any type of business ive yet to try the pizza but the gyro and calzone were delicious the price is not too bad its like any other restaurant comes to about  for two people|they were great then good now they are a great lace to work out but they keep messing with their hours it used to be midnight then it went to pm now it is pm close time that makes me a bit sad because it is called  hour fitness for a reason unfortunately there is not a club close to my house other than that one but the people are nice the garage parking is sweet and things tend to be clean as they are not used as much as a normal club|great location in noda right in the main section of north davidson next to many other great shops exterior and interior is very good atmosphere is excellent some people may describe it as hipster serving only craft beers etc though i dont think its a bad thing staff were quite friendly and engaging though for a crepe restaurant their selection of crepes were quite limited i ordered the queen city crepe which was burst of flavor the purple slaw on the side was also very good the section of cocktails looked excellent too one of the better restaurants in clt|i just ordered in for the night as i didnt feel like going out and about for starters aloha offers delivery and theyre quite cheap score i got a combo plate with the hamburger steak bbq beef and katsu curry the hamburger steak was tough and a bit bland for me personally the gravy kind of stuck to the beef and was too thick the katsu chicken is good but there could be more curry the reason i gave this place stars was solely for the bbq beef the beef is tangy and you get a bit of spice it is literally phenomenal if you ever need a place that delivers quick and is cheap order aloha i definitely recommend the bbq beef|i have been back a few times since my original review and have always had great service since so im increasing my rating still in love with their oven bakes and crave them regularly so delicious and worth the wait|cheap breakfasts but they get you with the beverages  steak was dry and scary looking eggs and hash browns were good|my family and i visited madison for a day and we stumbled across this place  we started with the poutine which was delicious  then i had the baja turkey burger  the guacamole was great and seasoned well the only problem was the bun was slightly dry  my dad had the brat and bacon burger and it was juicy  i would recommend it to anyone looking for a place to eat in madison|ok beers for a casino nothing excellent but not bad|real irish lunches and dinners gourmet level food guinness beer and other brands try the irish stews my favourite is the fish  chips|everyone liked their appetizer entree and dessert with one exception  my fish was overcooked and dry|delicious chinese food the veggies are fresh and chicken is good same with the sauce the sauce didnt taste like it was out of a bottleonly wish that there were better prices that is the only downfall that would prevent me from coming back|just across the train tracks on the strip mall friendly staff nice dining area bathroom is all jacked up from vandals hot sauce aint gonna destroy your mouth chorizo tacos were acceptable overall satisfied with my  o clock dinner will rate burritos in the future because they look mad decent|i went here  nights in a row and they couldnt have been more different the bartenders were great both times one night the bartender asked if i wanted a drink while i waited i did one night the bruschetta was to die for and the other night it was just okay their food is great|i was texting with my friend kate and she had mentioned that she was going to popeyes for lunch  she planted the damn seed  i had seen a commercial recently for their pepper barrel tenders too and they looked delicious  i decided to come down here for lunch  ive been to this popeyes a handful of times surprised i never wrote a review and its only about  miles from my work  i placed my order for the pepper barrel combo which comes with  strips choice of side fries a biscuit and a drink    not badnot bad at all  here is how everything waspepper barrel tenders  popeyes chicken strips are some of the best in the land  when i used to live in sd we could hit up the popeyes in el cajon a lot  glad to report that their strips are pretty consistent out here in az  these pepper barrel tenders are marinated in a tabasco sauce and then fried up  you could immediately tell that they looked a little different than the normal strips  they were nice and spicy and had great flavor  the tenders were a bit smaller than i had remembered but they did give me  of them instead of  maybe to compensate the skimp size  anywaysi got some sweet heat sauce with them and they were delicious  i would get them again for surefries  popeyes fries are hit and miss  when they are good they are really good  when they are bad they are flat out nasty  today they were really good  nice and hot crisp and full of flavor due to their seasoningcoating  if their fries were like this all the time i would be happy  if you arent a fry fan you can never go wrong with their mashed potatoes and gravybiscuit popeyes biscuits are fantastic  full of butter fluffy but sometimes they have a bit of a crunch when you bite in  i love them and could eat half a dozendrinks coke productsscoreservice is always prompt  maybe not the friendliest but they do get you your food really quick  one other thingfor whatever reason in my fucked up crazy mind  this popeyes seems like it should have a bullet proof glass window up at the counter  this popeyes is not in the hood or anything and it doesnt need a bullet proof glass window but if it did have one it would seem more complete some feng shui type shit   if i was a popeyes architect id definitely install one here   random i knowright  anywayspopeyes is good shit  i know i will be back soon enough|ive driven by this location hundreds of times heading to the grocery store across the parking lot and just stopped today independent locallyowned restaurants are always a plus especially when they serve pizza service was pretty good it was lunchtime so they were busy and the floor was definitely in need of sweeping food was hot and arrived quickly decent value for the money not spectacular but no complaints|three words free gift wrapping drops miclauren n and i went wandering around here in search of christmas presents for the little ones in our lives its fun to be the aunties this place has everything i was concerned that i would be overwhelmed by both the store and the crowds shopping for christmas but i was in so much awe of the place that i couldve stayed here all afternoon im pretty much just a big kid heres the other surprising thing the workers were all happy as can be thats a big deal to me ill tell you right now i used to work in the toy department at kmart back in my college days i hated christmas during those four years were talking stomp a reindeer kind of anger the crowds kids throwing toys everywhere parents throwing toys everywhere sidenote i also know how to mix paint and make keys in case anyone needs some nikki trivia questions in the future back to toys  co everyone here was helpful and smiling this shopping center can be kind of chaotic so be patient when looking for a parking spot i recommend driving down to the light over by the smashburger to make getting out of here a little bit easier|had the chipotle sandwich with the greek salad it was wonderful amount of food is enough to satisfy without feeling like you over ate|after taking in all of the holiday sights downtown we were starving mexican food is our favorite so we gave this place a try it sits above a seafood restaurant in market square we were given a table at the windows which was nice we could watch the shoppers walking by we were waited on immediately we ordered drinks along with chips and salsa the chips were tasty and a nice carrier for the salsa the salsa had a great flavor i ordered the burrito cancun it had steak and shrimp there was poco lettuce and sour cream on the side the hubby ordered chicken enchiladas he had green sauce on half and red sauce on half so we could try both his enchiladas came with refreshed beans and rice i took one bite of my burrito and i was in heaven im not sure how they treated or cooked the steak but it packed a big punch of flavor it was also very tender it was excellent i tried my husbands enchiladas i thought i would like the green sauce better but was surprised that i preferred the red the chicken like the steak in my burrito was flavorful and tender the enchiladas were spicy but you began to have a slow after burn in your mouth it was the perfect heat we left clean plates and with full bellies yum|the food is amazing fresh ingredients  great taste the quesadillas are my favorite filled with cheese my one complaint i was seated by the salsa bar next to the wall  somehow ended with white all over my jeans  jacket very inconvenient since now i have to go back home before going to work because it doesnt come off easily|food is ok i like the mashed potatoes instead of hash browns but the place is pretentious and expensive they need to master the basics like cleanliness   had a big glop of something on my menu and a sticky fork the pretense big sprig of rosemary stuck in the biscuit may justify the higher price but a biscuit with no butter seems a little dry portions are huge|ive been to hash house on two separate occasions now my first visit was for breakfast on a previous trip to las vegas and my most recent visit was for dinner the restaurant is located on the upper level of the linq hotel  casino the decor is what id call a modern farmhouse style picture lots of wood and rustic elements mixed with silver metals i like that particular style so i felt right at home the portions here are enormous neither my husband nor i could could finish even half of our plates during either visit the dishes are shareable which i highly suggest if youre coming here with children they offer a large variety of menu items a few of the items weve tried from the menu are chicken  waffles traditional pancakeeggbacon breakfast grilled salmon with goat cheese mashed potatoes and blue cheese stuffed burger and fries all were very delicious one thing to make note of if you plan to enjoy some of these huge portions yourself breakfast usually has a long wait while lunch and dinner do not enjoy|pretty good for what it is i always forget its there the breakfast burrito is bomb pretty good for a fast food mexican place|my cat had the sniffles so i made an evening appointment my regular vet closes at pm so if im working late i cant get in banfield has later hours which is convenient for the  workeri got there a few minutes early and might have waited  minutes before being taken to the exam room when you go to the exam room they see you right now no waiting for  or  or  minutes cant beat thatthe doctor and tech checked out my cat very friendly and kind to my cat after the exam the doctor prescribed a treatment identical to what my regular vet gives her for pretty much the same cost and a lot less time spent waiting checkout very fast as wellas a bonus if you need pet supplies youre right there at petsmart|the atmosphere is amazing whats not amzing is the layout seemingly endless stretches of nothing then tons of stuff piled on top of eachother and mind the stairs in the chandlier bar so dangerous|tried two different kind of tacos the el carbon is very plain no taste unless you count all the onions they use soft corn tortillas for the shell and they sure are small the crunchy taco was better but the lettuce tasted funny  also small in size|consistently last week tuesday it was bad  i got a no venti  foam soy latte   i wanted to to give another try so on monday  it was amazing  i even went back today  days in a row it was perfect   i tried to give her the  and told keep it for yourself she said my team   i are grateful put the money jar|my first time here hopefully just under construction but not very clean wish i could rate them on their work but the woman who was about to thread my eyebrows left me seated to go talk and i left because why would i have someone who looked unhappy close to my eyebrows no thanks|been enrolled here for a year and it has everything i need to break sweat like what others have said its a no frills gym nothing super fancy but definitely still has what you need i feel its a great location for a gym such as this wish they had a free weight area but come at the right times and any of the three squat racks is all yours|it was recommended to us as a really good indian food restaurant and we were not disappointed we have visited the restaurant now quite a few times for lunch and dinner as well as takeout food is always fresh and delicious i love going there for a lunch special they offer during the week why not five stars complimentary naan for eat in clients would be nice at least for dinner|met a friend here for drinks recently and was oh so pleasantly surprised  when this place was first suggested i thought uh oh another pretentious place in the heart of materialistic provincial snobbery surrounded by rubes trying hard to impress one another with their disposable overextended credit cards pi arrive and grab a seat in the laid back heated outdoor patio  theres a guy that resembles lou reed strumming his guitar with an excellent choice of tunes  i kick back and enjoy the atmosphere which is surprisingly not pretentious except for the arrogant clown behind me demanding his cruhdytes from the poor waitress that obviously forgot to bring them  he is rude he is obnoxious and hes a dick whos probably just looking for an excuse not to tip the poor gal who made an honest mistake on a busy night while trying to impress his friends with his demanding arroganceat any rate friend arrives we order a nice bottle of white wine and a few appies while we just sit back chat and enjoy the evening  service is competent and friendly wine is good  food is decent but nothing spectacular but the music is  i wish i could remember this guys name  he was that good  i especially enjoyed the moment when a little girl about  years old shyly approaches him to make a deposit in his tip jar  he sees her and starts to play and sing the wheels on the bus go round and round and the little girl is absolutely delighted and starts dancing  now thats what i call a class act  everybody loved itkudos to him and kudos to this place for their business acumen  ive since been back one more time and hope to return soonmaybe this weekendin the meantime can anybody give me the name of the musician so we can go when hes playing again  he didnt look like any of the guys listed on their calendar so it remains a mystery|too much attempt at comical comments the players all have good voices but by constantly trying to inject jokes it really downplays their singing abilities they also alter some lyrics in an attempt to be funny but most often just come off as silly the dean martin has a very good voice but does way too much horsing around and goes way overboard on a display of martins drinking most in audience would have much preferred some serious singing and less attempts to be comedians|was ok but nothing as special as i was expecting reading the reviews on yelpmaybe we just chose wrongwent for dinner on a sunday night at pm about a  minute wait to get a tabledisappointed that the ramen was not available only available for lunchgyoza that they call ravioli on the menu  deliciouschicken karaage tortillas  deliciousshort beef ribs  deliciousbut the japanese style bibimbap and the  hour pork was nothing specialjust didnt seem very authentic but what was i expecting from japanese tortillas and bibimbap p|i visit phoenixscottsdale regularly and stay at different resorts this was my first visit to talking stick  what distinguishes it very obviously from other properties is its large size it has quite a few floorsnot a low rise like many others and the large casino on the ground floor  its a lively environment in the common areas  the rooms are modern with expresso type decor but a standard room isnt as luxurious or well appointed as elsewhere  one thing that i really missed having was a comfortable chair or sofa to lounge on  the room had two queen beds and a desk chair but there was no space for more  on the plus side the black fig bistro and buffet on the ground floor have very fair prices by hotel standards another point to note is that talking sticks location is a bit removed so if you are someone who likes to get around on public transportation or walk around make sure you have uber or lyft on your smartphone the property also doesnt offer direct access to a hiking trail as other properties do finally i should point out there was no charge for wifi or a resort fee which is a plus  i visited in december when it was cool and look forward to returning in warm weather to try out the pools|fellow vegansthis korean place is for you the staff were so accommodating with their vegetarian recommendations i got the vegan bibimbap  tasty tofu rice and veggies mix that in with some kimchi yes i am aware of the minuscule amount of dried shrimp and its the perfect spicy meal music is far too loud and i have to overdrink to drown it out but its a small price to pay for fresh and healthy food off the strip|what a great little spot for boba tea before i knew about this place i would drive all the way to chinatown to get my boba tea fix but now whenever i crave it i can just come here instead the girl working was very sweet and the place has plenty of tables if you want to sit in there and enjoy your boba a little hidden gem in the northwest|as the southwest part of the valley has grown the united states post office has failed to keep pace this is the only fullservice post office in the entire southwest part of the valley and as such has enormous demands placed upon it even though the unionized workforce tries to maintain a good flow and management is actively engaging in the process the lines are still out the door it is a littleknown fact that the junk mail you get in your mailbox is what keeps wages for postal workers high and productivity low another little known fact is the average postal workers annual salary in the las vegas metropolitan area is k with many earning unionprotected overtime that significantly increases their take home pay just another shining example of gross inefficiencies of the public sector even though the united states postal service is a private entity it is still considered part of the public sector the union protected jobs provide exorbitant wages for obvious mistreatment of the customer at the time of the writing of this review i was standing in line with a woman who claims her postal carrier refuses to deliver her mail and she is forced to stand in line every week to pick it up in my case the vendor shipping my package informed me that my package was shipped without signature or anything yet my postal carrier refused to deliver it and left a notice on my door requiring me to stand in line at the post office to pick it up with signature when sheit should have just dropped the package off in my home box or doorstep same day i had three shipments come in via upssurepost  shipped through ups but delivered to usps for deliver to the door  two made it a third was delivered to my neighbor down the street and yet the post office is still full of people its still like a soup kitchen during the depression in every post office i have ever been to this one being the worst and no matter how much people complain nothing gets any better i guess thats to be expected because the united states postal service had only been in business for two hundred years sarcasmmy advice do not ever use usps if you can avoid it fedex and ups are two freemarket alternatives total dick move by usps every daythis review is

good but nothing remarkable would we come back maybe|super disappointing  the show seems to have been cut way down and doesnt have nearly the audience participation it used to   of the production value and  the dancers seemingly and its still expensive  if theyll going to pare down the show they need to pare down the price and quit making it seem like its still a fullblown vegas show  that said these dudes can dance  id certainly have liked to see a lot more for the money  lets ramp it back up boys|this place is cheap efficient and get the job done right  for most items  they will also replace a button on a button down shirt at no charge ive never had an issue here the folks working there are quick and friendly i primarily have used cougar cleaners for my work attire my only reason for the lack of a  star review is when i needed my duvet cleaned its  cotton not fancy material or anything it was  for the duvet and took over a week also for each sham was  considering their everyday items are so reasonable and generally available next day i was just floored for my work dresses button downs pants and skirts i will absolutely continue to use cougar as my primary dry cleaners but for specialty items i will seek out a more economical and speedy service|food is great crowd is ok except sports night or weekends regularly we come here with my family kids love the pizza and chicken noodle soup i think ive tried most of their food here service is great i want to give  stars if i could its just that waiting time sometimes is a bummer|ive been here a few times already since i moved to this side of town and its a decent burger place customer service is ok the food is overpriced for the quality but its tastier than mcdonalds fake stuff so ill always be back great menu selection just hope they can hire someone to actually make the food with quality|there was a free  cash card over the weekend got some gloves for  these guys were great in accepting it and super helpful i think just because of that i enjoy this sports authority otherwise i would probably not ever step into one|came in for lunch yesterday a lady quickly pointed out a table for us to be seatedordered the seafood tom yum rice noodle soup in mild i didnt wait long before it was brought out to me love the soup sour and spicy and there was tons of it couldnt even finish drinking it all seafood included slices of fish cakes shrimp mussel and fish balls it would have been perfect if they threw some mushrooms in there service was alright took a long while before they even brought out my husbands lunch and when they did they didnt bring him anything to eat it with had to ask for the condiments as well since there was none on our table  this seem to be the only thai restaurant in the surrounding area not the best thai food i ever had but will do when it comes to satisfying that sudden thai craving|heard so much about this place stood at the front and waited for someone to greet us for almost  minutes most of my table ordered chicken and french toast my husbands chicken came out extremely burnt and had to be sent back i ordered a breakfast plate with eggs sausage and french toast which was just okay i was extremely excited to try itbig highly disappointed i can say our server was great and made good recommendations|good decor and decent thai food saw it on groupon and decided to try it out the ambiance was similar to a miniature version of tao the tom tom seafood was spot on satay chicken skewer and fried calamari was sublime unfortunately my favorite dish pad se ew was underseasoned and generally underwhelming it overall a good dining experience|great sports bar  great specials  good bar food  id give  stars but i found it really really loud  maybe im just old|went here with a foodie friend and his dad while in town for a day  as is our style we ordered lots of appetizerssmall plates to get a complete feel for the restaurant and what they were doingthe items involving seafood were the best for me there was an oyster with a deep sea taste the scallops were outstanding and the ceviche was nice if not a bit overpriced  the meat dishes were very uneven with a braised beef dish being the best because of a wonderful rich sauce but anything with pork belly being uneven at best and the meat board being skimpy with the piles of mustard being larger than the offered cured meats and sausagetwo things struck me as either illconceived or not acceptable  there was very little vegetable accompaniment to our dishes and we ordered eight i believe  a small leafy salad on one a couple of mushrooms on another  yes they were appetizerssmall plates we ordered but i scanned other tables for entrees and they seemed to be the same  i would think a farm to table type restaurant would be brimming with vegetables  yes we didnt order that festival plate that was all vegetables butthe other was at  pm on a friday night our waitress was clearly intoxicated and it affected her quality of service  in fact she seemed to relish taking our drink orders more than our food orders|out of all the buffets ive tried in vegas so far wicked spoon is my  when my family and i arrived around pm there was only  parties ahead of us in line we waited off to the side for a couple minutes before we were seated love the simple table setting decor i walked the entire buffet and ended with a decently full plate i enjoyed the crab legs kimchi fried rice carnitas nacho and the dessert bar one of the best pecan maple bread pudding i have ever tried  with a side of vanilla bean gelato yes a person for dinner|henderson area park with a lot of green space not far from gvr area the pittman wash trail a baseball diamond sand volleyball pits tennis courts and a small playground are among the amenities here parking lot is small but it is safe to park on the street if needed on weekends this park gets busy early i like how there are a few local food trucks that seem to regularly stop by on weekends the bathrooms are clean but only have two stalls|great food and service  we had the cheesy garlic bread salmon caesar salad and meatballs special  yummythis is our first visit here and we will definitely be back|decided to order my own version of an oldschool subwayesque spicy italian salami pepperoni lettuce tomato banana peppers pickles olives olive oil vinegar and oregano grabbed a bag of chips and a water like all airport spots the price is ridiculous but let me just say that my sub was on point better than most sub joints and i appreciated that they sliced the deli meats right in front of me after i ordered the  people working were all super friendly and personable definitely better than i expected and i was happy to have a good hoagie|great place for downtown interior was open and interesting the menu left something to be desired dont get me wrong the food was delicious but the menu was limited i ordered the scallops with sweet potato wrapped in bacon it was so tasty but there was no side dish for the price of this dish there should have been a ton of the snap peas on this plate for desert i ordered the salted caramel which was so good but it was runny inside next time we will come in just for wine and the meatcheese platters that they offer you can choose your cheeses and different meats to accompany your wine and nosh|jy vais

cuisine as well as range of american chinese classics for those who want themhad my rehearsal dinner here small group of  with chinese banquet style they were very accommodating and easy to work withveggie favorites i love the fresh sauted snow pea leaves pricey at about  but my favorite veggie side because of their light flavor and freshness i also love the eggplant in garlic sauce very generous servings and just enough spicethis place can definitely be on the spicier side but my mild spice husband loves the cumin beef and the dumplingsservice is fast and efficient orange slices to end each meal  great neighbor asian fix atmosphere is so so with white paper on tables but overall homey with good lighting|one of the places i planned to make regular on my list great value great taste and friendly service i love their lunch specials beats going to chinese places in chinatown where they over charge and have rude customer service they need more places like these|fantastic food and hospitality at great prices the portions are good and the owner is super friendly we found it on yelp and glad that i did |i have purchased three honda automobiles at findlay honda henderson over the past  years i have been satisfied with their sales staff but mostly really commend their service department their customer service is secondtonone travis miller is my goto service advisor their express service is also toonotch i dont feel like anybody here uses highpressure tactics in sales or in service my only complaint is that they usually have fox on the television ugh|we were craving sushi but our normal spot we go to decided to close on sundays we stumbled upon iron chef and i am so glad we did all day happy hour  off their specialty rolls sake bomb specials extremely attentive staff keep in mind we were a large group of  people the waitress we had brought us free salmon steaks i think that was what it was called for the table it was a nice touch i had the spicy tuna mango roll and the tootsie roll one of my friends had the flaming dragon roll and the yummy yummy the flaming dragon is awesome to watchthey also have chinese food on their menu i got to try their mongolian beefwe left full and happy we will be coming back |i love the food here so i wish i could give a higher ratingbut my issue is with the takeout service i order takeout here all the time  at least twice a month i usually get either the chicken salad sampler salad or the sandwich both delicious if they are made correctly  orders ago i picked up a chicken salad sampler  only to find upon getting home it was missing the lettuce it is a salad  orders ago ordered the salad again to find my order was missing the salad dressing nooooo and last order i think was the last straw i ordered the chicken salad sandwich on a pita and i came home with about  the amount of chicken salad necessary to fill the pita the rest was stuffed with dry lettuce great food lazy takeout service|i think we can all agree that the burger is one of the greatest foods on earth who doesnt love a great burger topped just the way they want it with the numerous and creative varieties out there im always looking for the next great burger jointone night after watching the habs beat the bruins at the bell centre we decided to try this place out we were not disappointed instead of the beef burger we went for bison burgers hint they are fresher than the beef patties as theyre cooked to order  bison meat is very lean compared to beef but this one was perfectly cooked and very juicy despite being so leanadd nice atmosphere and great service and ill definitely be back|stopped here to eat while taking a friend home from the airport the parking lot tricks you on the way out i got stuck and had to turn around anyways back to it i got the ny strip with fried rice on the teppanyaki side which also comes with soup veggies and noodles it was a lot of food i ended up taking half of it home it was decent and seemed to be fair for quality vs cost its a nice place to take people to if theyve never had teppanyaki or just want some the show with food was your typical show i havent seen anything i havent seen before but its still fun to watch i also got some nigiri sushi tuna and salmon both of which were pretty good i honestly didnt expect much but the fish is pretty fresh for vegas cost vs quality i say its decent if im in the area ill definitely stop by again but i wouldnt go out if my way to eat hereoh the chef was pretty cool so we got him a shot of tequila to say thank you | the good dr shreder is fantastic best pcp and ame ive had he gets  stars  the bad too often my appointments have gone way beyond normal todays appt was  got in at  out at i know hes good thats why his practice is so busy but  scheduling needs to improve then the practice would be a  star|walking in you think of a true irish pub with brick walls black tables a welcoming bearded publican and a cozy atmosphere we went for lunch it was decently packed i had the boar sausage sandwich it was packed with juiciness and gamey flavor of the boar interrupted by the occasional fennel it was very well done and made in house i also tried their bread pudding dessert also delicious and not too sweet|the only reason i am giving turnberry  stars is because of the incredibly nice employees who work there at least at the west tower  they work very hard at helping you with whatever you need  but for living in the complex the value the location  turnberry towers is one star  i noticed most of the reviews are from renters  well i am one of the very few idiots that actually purchased  if you want to rent here your experience is probably going to be decent  i mean you make zero investment and live in a luxury apartment close to the strip  but no one should consider purchasing here until they get rid of all the renters and focus on building the service of the complex to accommodate owners  the hoa dues are in line with other high rises in vegas yet an owner is going to get the same service and amenities as a renter|to me it was  stars but wife said  so i am going with  good prices like the look of the interior i find the quality comparable to golden wok but less than thara thai|cute little coffee shop kids and adults can write everywhere with markers very cozy inside nice bakery selection and sandwiches games for the kids good conversation spots for adults and i havent even gotten to the coffee yum good selection of coffeeespresso drinks all for a great price|best poutine with duck confit delicious pub burger and short ribs cant go wrong with those and the beer list is impressive  the only issue is that they nickel and dime you the waiter asked if id like fries onion rings or poutine with my burger i said poutine boom my  burger turned into a  burger he also tried getting me to add avocado or bacon just beware of that also we had a yelp coupon for a free draft this does not mean whatever beer you order will be free the free draft is a shitty miller lite none of this was communicated to us if it had no big deal|this was our first night in lv after  hours of travelling and wanted somewhere within easy reach of our hotel for dinner buca di beppo is inside the excalibur hotel complex and offers family sized italian meals  that means for us brits that the portions are big we had the large pepperoni which was too big for three of us with a few slices remaining on the board the pizza was thin crust and the pepperoni was quite tasty but the tomato sauce was a bit insipiddrinks are on permanent happy hour so we could get a light beer for just  a glass there was a little issue with initially getting served but this was due to the bar area only being covered by one person at pm when we were served though the guy was great and looked after us really well making recommendations to save moneybearing in mind its inside a hotel its a good bargain and acceptable for a quick snack|i think it will be a preference thing here old school movie before big time multiplexes took over  if you are looking for the new fancy recliner movies then you will not prefer this theater this is old with low and uncomfy chairs it has its pluses and minuses cool lobby it looks like you are in a space tunnel and has tons of video games also they have cool theater doors the negatives are very uncomfy chairs and really bad bathrooms they really need to fix them or clean them more often it is very cheap here only three bucks to see a flic every day with  tuesdays this is the place movies go to die lol just kiddingthe movies here are the ones out of the main theaters and right before they go into redbox you an see a movie on the big screen at the price of a dvd rental movies are in and out of the theater so fast now it is a pretty good deal however  do not look for brand new releases here but month old or older movies the selections are not that great though and the times are really limited on tuesdays the movie i wanted to see was only showing at pm if you work for a living you have to wait until you are vacation on the plus side since i was off i saw two movies for three bucks you really cant beat that deal out of your home dvd selection i did not get concessions but they seem just as expensive as any of the other more ritzy places in town they are not cheaper here i guess they have to make up the money somewhere all in all i will go again to catch the movies i missed at the fancy theaters i do admit the staff members here were really nice and friendly that in itself is a huge plus|why cant we make a big deal about tacos on each day of the week instead of just tuesday  americas taco shop figured it out and they celebrate taco tuesday all day everyday  whether you want steak tacos chicken tacos fish tacos or even just a bean burrito they got you covered  dining area is spacious and the staff is friendly  come here any time during the day and feast yourself on some great tasting tacos  i prefer getting them american style with a side of chips and salsa|i did not have high expectations for this ramen place but i absolutely loved my spicy miso ramen the broth was so flavorful and the noodles were al dente one of the must haves during the winter season i just did not like the meat in the spicy miso because there was a certain smell to it|if youre looking for cheap divey chinese food this place delivers i wanted to find some cheap chinese food somewhere near my work downtown i was tired of paying the  dollar minimum at downtown placesi found this on yelp and man am i glad i did the building and restaurant is completely barebones and hole in the wall however the food is good it is obnoxiously cheap and the people that work there are very friendlyits hard to leave here not feeling like you got a delicious value and they even have a drive through if youre in a rush definitely recommend if you like pretty good chinese at amazing prices|way overrated  the only thing i enjoyed was the american rib cap the sticky toffee pudding def saved the day our seafood platter was very average and the famous beef wellington was a let down  its cold very disappointed expected soo much better |the service has gotten rocky the wait staff seem undertrained because theyre slow and inattentive took forever for water and took forever for our check they never checked if we needed anything and we dont need much considering its a selfserving sushi conveyer belt the food is very good though and the experience in general is fun i would check it out but expect to be there a little longer than you want|great place to grab a drink tons of beer selections and a varied cocktail menu jurys still out on the food never had anything that was bad  some of the appetizers are stellar but everything else has just been ok  would try again though|we found ourselves once again  celebrating the holiday season with my husbands colleagues at the industry public house my last review ranted raved about the service and the food and i gave them a well deserved  stars but we werent as impressed this time not that anything was wrong but just not deserving that coveted  star rating our sever while friendly wasnt as good as who we had last year we waited for ever for just about everything food orders drinks boxes everything he forgot to ring in one persons order and they sat there empty handed until we were all long finished our meals i got the brussel sprouts once again because last time i was hooked on them and anticipating my next opportunity to have them and i was so terribly let down they changed the way they make them i guess and it was such a disappointment i truly just didnt like them and it was sad  my husband wasnt crazy about his burger he said the aoli was way over powering he didnt eat more than half of it which is not normal haha i mean not to say we wont return but im hoping that last time wasnt just a fluke well see what happens the next time we go i guess|so the chicken is delicate and lovely especially if you crave salt i had both bbq and just roasted and recommend the roasted the mushrooms are incredible and recommend them with confidence i would not recommend the grits as i found them to be undercooked and a weird combination of bacon and corn i know should have rocked everything else is really good but if you are salt intolerant this is not the place for you good service but not greatyou can get ignored once waiter moves on so get everything you want when st ordering even a second beer can at times be difficult  child menu is okay and does have some kids food but suggest to order off regular menu manager or hostess rocks very helpful you will like this place|food was ok ive had better at restaurants charging half what we paid here but on the plus side the atmosphere was fun and the staff was prompt and friendly|been seeing dr hughes for almost  years now she has always been professional and caring and non judgmental which is critical for honest conversations she is very efficient and to the point which i appreciate as im very similar if you are looking for warm and fuzzy she may not be right for you but shes an excellent dr who has helped me through various issues over time her staff manage the busy practice well and i am always able to get in and out in a reasonable time frame ive recommended her to many and all are happy|ive been to church a couple of times mainly for cocktails but recently decided to stay and check out the dinner menuafter arriving without a reservation we were told it would be an hour wait no worries we decided to  head to the bar and enjoy a cocktail or two and the hostess said she would come grab us after an hour and ten minutes i wondered why there were tables open and we had not been seated after we checked with the hostess we learned she had forgot us that was definitely frustratingafter browsing the menu we decided to start with the pork belly spring rolls which were pretty good as for the entrees we decided to order the  second steak and arctic char  the steak was good not my thing but my date enjoyed it  as for the char it was good but definitely lacking seasoning i asked for salt but never received itwe then decided to enjoy the chocolate caramel bar for dessert pretty good the crumble was amazingoverall i think church is a great spot for a cocktail or two but the service and food is just ok nothing i would remember or recommend someone must go to|we discovered this place a couple of years back when looking for dim sum in edinburgh it was recommended by some real experts so why not try weve now been here a number of times and really like it they do really nice dumplings my favourite probably being the salmon and prawn one the duck rolls are really good and weve tried some of the stir fry noodle dishes most recently i went for the chicken rice porridge id never had it before and really liked it its nice to have a good dim sum in edinburgh this place is off the beaten path but doesnt disappoint the service could be a bit warmer but thats easily forgettable once youve gotten your first plate|my last visit here was ok upon entering the establishment i notice a pile of peanut shells on a table which had not been cleared during my entire visiti ordered my usual of a little cheeseburger all the way with green peppers the experience of eating the burger was the same as last time juicy flavorful and enjoyable their consistency in their burgers is out of this world worth a visit but dont mind the mess usually there are only  workers during the weekday and with how popular the restaurant is it does not seem that they have the manpower to clean the restaurant as frequent|friendly staff  reasonable prices and great food  it really doesnt get any better than that  i keep saying im going to try the burgers i hear so much about but man if i cant resist the fried fish everytime|i am on the email list for martys market events and the latest emails have highlighted their hh specials enticing enough that a friend and i stopped in on a wednesday evening around  the happy hour special includes  beer  wine and half off the bar menu i am drawn to places that include food in their hh specials their drink menu isnt elaborate but they have something for everyone i opted for jacks pear cider because its the only gluten free beer option and it is locally sourced my friend opted for little brown ale and chocolate stout fyitheir drinks only come in bottles so you are unable to taste any before you order i hope to see martys expand their cider selection in the future hint arsenal cider house is local and delicious off of the bar menu there were vegetarianvegan and gluten free items noted but none that were both gluten free and vegan i switched over to the dinner menu and ordered a side of roasted winter vegetables beets  squash my friend opted for the cheese and meat plate from the bar menu the food was served relatively quickly my roasted vegetables were diced and delicately seasoned i could still taste the natural flavor of the beets and squash my friends plate came slivers of the meat and cheese listed on the menu a large serving of mustard seeds and grilled bread she had no complaints about the flavor but we both agreed that the portions were too small she didnt have enough on her plate to pair with the mustard seeds even with the grilled bread i finished my side of vegetables in a few bites i dont know if portions are down sized during hh to compensate cutting the cost or if they are always that size either way we didnt feel that the quality of the food made up for the portion size our waitress was very pleasant and attentive and the barseating area has a cozy feel i love the look of the exposed kitchen and the option to shop in the store once youre done eating outside of my dining experience i have been to martys for groceries and always found what i needed at a decent price they have unique health food items so its easy for me to find gluten free  vegan friendly options moving forward i will continue to shop at martys for groceries and perhaps ill try their dinner one evening the full menu looked awesome for hh however i will venture to places where i get more bang for my buck|mixed feelings on this one my friend got her bridal dress here which was absolutely stunning our dress consultant was very nice and helpful and great when we came here again to pick out bridesmaid dresses however scheduling is disorganized for the tailor oftentimes when we came here for an appointment it wasnt in the books despite reserving the time way in advance and receiving an appointment card for the datei also had my bridesmaid dress altered here the alteration services cost more than the dress had i known the cost in advance i probably would have taken it to an independently owned tailoring shop and had it done there the actual tailoring of my dress though was good and the tailors were nice my friends wedding dress alterations were a different story for some reason the tailor was stuck on giving her a certain bustle and did not offer her any other options when she discovered a day later that there were actually a few different bustle types she immediately asked to change it and make another appointment which apparently did not sit well with them when my friend got the bustle changed to the style she wanted even the associates here said that bustle looked a lot better than the one the tailor was going to offer herin general the dresses themselves i think are nice and the consultants are very helpful but they need to work on getting their appointments straight and offering better customer service with the tailoring|i wish pei wei was nationwide because its one of my favorites this is a great location with a nice staff and clean tables the line moves pretty slow but overall a great place this location has sushi and it was pretty good i recommend the caramel chicken but everything smells amazing|after having spice market last night if you love yourself dont go there bacchanal was like paradise right now they have the holiday price inflation  for brunchlunch and  for dinner before tax so its pretty pricey my cousin and i managed to pay lunch price and we stayed well into dinner so that was pretty lucky the food is pretty good for a buffet the crab was definitely fresher than spice markets and the oysters was super fresh and yummy my fav dish from them has to be the carne asada tacos that carne asada was soooo on point prime rib was okay but the mango jalepeno chicken sausage was good pork belly was too thick and i did not enjoy their brisket basil beef over at the asian area was good in flavor but way too salty peking duck was also too salty got a bowl of ramen and it was pretty good the char siu was definitely the star of the ramen   ate a whole bunch of desserts and learned that las vegas cant do cheesecake seriously skip the cheesecake macarons were okay but i only really like the passion fruit and pistachio ones i was sad that i was too full for a crepe tho  the highlight and star of the dessert island however was the ice cream omg creamy gelato and icy tart sorbetto was a home run for me i kept coming back for more the panna cotta was also very delicious qoverall although it was pricy i had a good experience definitely the best buffet in vegas and the best one ive had in a while|this cafe rio is a little stingy with their portions and there is just not that much love in this place|zarkana is arias resident show it is a classic cirque du soleil that features acrobats aerialists jugglers high wire and trapeze artists my favorite part of the show is the sand art and the funny clownsthat was the only thing that kept me entertainedthe performers were good and talented but i guess ive seen something better tickets are a little pricey im lucky i get them as comps if you dont know how to ask for promotions and discounts since this show is always running a promotion unlike o and michael jackson onefor me as an adult i wasnt impressed but if you have kids and you want to bring them to a cirque show this is what i would recommend|i was so surprised at the level of food quality  the clam chowder rivaled the chowder i had on the wharf in seattle wa  cheese curds were great  fish and chips great  it was all good|my husband chose this facility because it is convenient to our home location they are prompt efficient and cost effective with their inhouse plan  this is a clinic  and he has been seen by the on staff nurse practitioner  not an md  some illnesses or conditions get referred and they cannot treat or address anything very serious  but for the purpose of a cold or flu  or simple infection  they are a good choice|i visited roast on a weeknight with some friends we were attending an event later in the evening so we opted for a lighter fare i chose cheese curds still on a mission to try every curd in madison which were very good  tasty and wellcooked  and a small southwest salad i am not a salad person by nature but i really didnt need a full mealand everybody else ordered a said so i just followed suit  the southwest salad usually comes with chicken but i opted for a vegetarian version which was delicious it almost made we want to be a salad person i ordered some kind of yummy cranberry apple beer that was delicious i am not enough of a beer snob to remember the exact name    our server was exceptionally friendly and helpful when we were trying to make our dinner decisions the bar was decorated for christmas and just overall had a fun laid back atmosphere i will definitely be back to roast the next time im on state street|we expected better the room is well decorated and trendy filled with lots of college age and slightly older diners service was non chalant even with lots of people waiting and us being long done with our mediocre food they did not bring a checkthe best dish was pulled porky bun good went down hill quickly from there dumpling were terrible i would not be surprised if they were frozen none of the  of us liked or even came close to finishing our soup or see wah noodle dishes it just wasnt tasty i usually like thai food but not this time|their menu is simplistic and its easy to decide what you want to order since discovering this place ive been back  times theyre almost always packed but if you dont have a larger party of  or  you will be seated very quickly you can also byob my favorite dish is the see yew with chicken its delicious ive found myself craving it now and then and i have to go back for more their prices for their main dishes are also pretty reasonable most noodle plates are  and its a big helping the food also comes out super quickly the longest ive had to wait was probably  minutes for my foodthe only issue i have is with their appetizers i wish they werent as expensive or gave you more for your money under snacks we ordered the spring rolls for  only  came and they werent any bigger than my thumb we havent ordered any else sincequick tips bring cash they dont except cards they also dont have a phone|i have been going to the s diner since i was like  i love it here the food is always good the service is speedy the waitresses are super nice and its a family business so its always the same faces its one of my fave places to go for breakfast i prefer this place over ihop any day forever good service and overall a really nice environment  not many mom and pop diners here in vegas so i really appreciate this place|updating my review from  stars to  stars because papinos has a functional website again with an online menu yay thank you weve ordered from them  times in the last  months because of this small detail so helpful to have an online menu|came here last night with my mom aunt and sister for drinks and apps before catching a movie next door happy hour prices are great   off apps and flatbreads  glasses of wine some are  regular price  cocktails we had several rounds of drinks and shared four different appetizers and our bill was only  for four people the boneless chicken wings with szechuan sauce was amazing and fyi they dont have hot tea but i bet most people dont come here for thatservice wasnt the bestdrink orders seemed to take a little longer than necessary to come out to the table considering that it wasnt very busy our waitress was okayevery time she brought something to the table she spun on her heels and ran away before we could ask for anything else took me three attempts to order a drink and we only had our water glasses filled once the entire time we asked another waiter at one point to send our waitress over and he said she was too busy however he was kind enough to help us out and he was  times quicker than she had beenoverall the food and drinks were good and the prices are great service is just a little lacking| stars just for being a little pricey today i got a shredded chicken burrito it comes with chicken rice and pico de gallo pretty good|i finally got the chance to go to zoo lights this year ive been wanting to do it for years but just never got around to it it was a neat experience there were so many fun animal lights the trees were gorgeous and the light show was pretty cool so why only  stars i honestly think it is super overpriced  per person no discounts for kids tickets unless they are under the age of  and all the activities camel ride photos merry go round stingray bay were extra  hot chocolate was  which security made you throw out as you left the park i understand not bringing drinks in but not being able to leave with a beverage you paid for inside the park i just felt nickel and dimed i will say its a nice date night activity or something to do with the kids all in all im glad i got to experience zoo lights would i go again probably not unless someone else was paying|loved it bread was burnt on my husbands corned beef brisket sandwich but everything else made up for it highly recommend the maine lobster mini rolls|limited food court so i picked to try this place out for   before tax i got the  chicken tenders with fries chicken tenders were okaynot bad fries sucked not the best and greasy with so flavor over all its an okay place if you like chicken check it out butwhy its an aok three stars rating is because my friends and i had to wait  minutes for our food ridiculous there was one girl working and two guys the one girl was cooking all the food the other two guys did not help her and were just standing around she cooked the chicken tenders and the fries the guys would just either ring up a customer and then stand there to package the food even packing the food didnt make sense they would put everything in the bag side ways so when i went to pick up the back and walk back to my hotel it all fell outtruly there needs to be a manager or someone there checking their workers out  minute wait for three chicken tenders and some fries is crazy wasnt even busy props to that one girl tho working her butt off|micro diner is a small humble diner in mt washington right by the overlooks on grandview ave boyfriend and i seated ourselves at a cozy yet roomy corner table right behind the bar i got the macro breakfast pancakes two eggs your choice of meat i got sausage and your choice of either hash browns or home fries i got hash browns boyfriend got steak  eggs which also came with your choice of potatoes and toast we ordered the cinnamon french toast as well we enjoyed the pancakes which were the perfect texture and thickness although i do like the thin hotcakes at pamelas too and the cinnamon french toast was pretty good too just wish their portion was bigger however my eggs tasted strange as if they made it way before i even ordered it the hash browns were tasteless maybe they expected you to season to taste so i sprinkled a generous amount of black pepper on it not the best brunch place around and a bit out of the way if youre a college student in pittsburgh but they have good pancakes and decent french toasttaste  atmosphere  presentation  service  overall  |i bought my wife a massage here and she was not impressed she said the service was under par and i shouldnt have wasted my money |le caf rico est trs petit il faut donc viter dy aller en grand nombre trois semble tre le maximum ce qui est dommage car le caf y est assez bon et peu cher on peut choisir de prendre une tasse ou un bol pour ceux qui ont vraiment besoin dune plus grande dose de caf les serveurs sont sympathiques et viennent servir les clients  leur table ce qui vite une maladresse aux gens malhabiles comme moi si ce nest pas le genre de caf  chercher pourquoi ne pas sy arrter quand on est dans le coin |the short rib tacos are really good the three taco plate is just the right amount of food the service was good cant wait to try the rest of the menu|like the name says they definitely aim to give customers an experience i went here for the first time recently after a few friends referred me and i saw such great reviews online the salon is very laid back they are located below the  south church apartment complex caddy corner to the gallery and craft they do not have a phone so to make an appointment you will either need to call or stop in if possible i recommend stopping in i was able to get a cancelation appointment quickly by doing sothey start off your first visit with a salon tour the washroom is dimly lit and tranquil you get a free head and neck massage with any cut service and not just the massage you feel like youre getting having someone else wash your hair its a solid  minute massage after your hair is washed while i did not get color she mentioned that a paraffin wax hand massage is included with any color service as well oh cant forget to mention that they also have a keg of free beer from unknown brewery as well the consultation is a pretty long question promoted dialog about what your dream hair would look like what you dont like that you have had done before any specific concerns etc before they get started so why  stars i asked for and showed pictures of the lob haircut i wanted and specifically said i do not like layers if anything a few really long blended ones were ok but that i generally speaking wasnt a fan of them at all i love how my cut looks from the front it is just past shoulder length however i now have a lot of layers that go up about five inches in the back that i particular dislike i didnt say anything because at that point i figured my only option was to cut my hair shorter to blend them in better and i didnt want to go shorterthe staff was very friendly and seemed knowledgable since i have only heard great things i will probably give them another try but this time be very specific and direct about what i do and do not want with my haircut specifically appointment lasted about two hours but they did mention they can get you in and out quicker if you want to opt out of some of the experience portions of your appointment who wouldnt want a free massage though|i came here on a monday for lunch and waited  mins for seating i had the lunch special and tried the bulgogi and korean chicken for protein house salad cream cheese wonton for appetizer and added beef brisket and rice i think the meat was marinated a little too sweet i am a meat lover btw i really like the cream cheese wonton but not the sauce that came with it the restaurant was clean it only have one restroom stall for each gender i had a tall korean waiter and he was doing a great job even though he forgot to bring the macaroni salad i requested its okay though i saw him running back and forth so i didnt get upset overall the food here was mediocre i live in socal and i prefer the kbbq in or near my area because it an allyoucaneat restaurant andor buffet the restaurant was clean it only have one restroom stall for each gender they also have a little bar area so i think this place is ok not bad of course|got the gangnam menu for  people and it is definitely a lot of food good meat service can be friendlier|one of the best kbbq around the las vegas area little bit pricey but definitely delicious|good food just wish there was an all you can eat great for happy hour  dollars per meat|great place to eat had happy hour and dishes were definitely affordable just wish rice was free|i really wanted to give this a  for cleanliness when we checked in we had a great reservationists who advises me of the upgrade we received but when we got to our room it was the room i booked at first glance i could tell the room wasnt clean to my standards dust on light fixtures found a rubber band on the bathroom floor and mirrors could have been cleaned properly also was greatly disappointed in the location of room th floor and last room at very end of hall when we looked out our window we are looking straight at a garage and then the other side was apartments now i did like the size of room and bathroom was huge lighting sorta dark so i am sure i will be looking like a girl with too much make up on now we have been in here  hours and its amazing what a few drinks can do to your perception came back in the evening and looked out window with the apartments and got a beautiful view of the strip lights and the linq turned the music on that they offer and we just relaxed and sang a lot the bed i will give a solid  the room is worth the discount special but if its over  i will stay at the venetians or caesars so far great service from the people we have met|dont let the name fool you when you order fajitas they will set them aflame at your table side delicious  |our waiter peso was the best the food was delicious and i highly recommend this place ask for peso|i go to ll from time to time just to have something a little different its nothing like real hawaiian food but the serving portions make it tolerablethis ll was constructed from a former s diner so theres a oldschool feeling upon entering the establishment my last visit here was definitely not the best visit i have hadi order the chicken katsu which is my usual pick my other being the loco moco the wait was not too long and my party and i were served by the waitresscashier my chicken katsu came with no cabbage on the bottom and was quite dry and tasteless it was as if there was more care put into the breading than the chicken itself if it werent for the sauce that accompanied the chicken katsu as well as the sriracha i do not think i would have been able to finishll is not a horrible place to go to but there are a variety of other places to eat down the road if you go east on lake mead blvd| but rounding up hmmm maybe its a solid consnoisy until about amshowers dont close thus can feel

staff was very helpful and friendly when we entered we all ordered fairly quickly since we were all getting the famous fish tacoswhen we got our tacos we were all very excited to begin the presentation was beautiful  the tacos were big and piled high and very colorful  after taking a couple of bites i realized these just werent the same tacos  first they were tomatoes mixed in with the mango salsa those two flavors just dont mix very well  second there was a particularly peppery flavor somewhere in the mix  it was also very little mango salsa and what salsa there was was not very sweet  overall it was a disappointing experience i think if they upped their game a little they would be on par with their maui counterpart|rude employee bought  different meals for my family asked for  sauces which would be  per personmeal sounds fair nope employee said i could only have  sauces but could buy a tub of sauce why cant i have  sauces per full mean i purchased  sauces per meal isnt excessive|food tastes great you dont get alot of food for the pricei took my family there it was nice  we went during the summer  my son enjoyed the outside misters|highly recommended i should say that this place did not let me down it was clean quick  still fresh  yummy i shall return|mcfaddens was completely desolate when me and my friends arrived on a thursday evening around pm is that too early to expect a crowd we had just left blue martini next door which had quite the crowd going going from blue martini to mcfaddens was a definite downgrade and to put it bluntly killed our vibe and put us into sleep mode even as we left around pm mcfaddens was still really slowmy group decided to sit outside to escape the depressive state inside the waitress promptly brought out menus and took our orders she was actually the saving grace of this establishment she was on top of everything during our short stay and checked on us often i upped my review to three stars instead of two just because of her the mister ordered bottled heinekens  and mozzarella sticks  the mozzarella sticks were disappointingly lackluster and served room temperature the side of marinara tasted off as well for  it was kind of a rip off i remember years ago mcfadden was always crowded and seemed like the place to be now i know to avoid this place if im looking for a good time at town square if you want to be where the actions at stick with blue martini or stoneys insteadyelp  challenge  |i mostly come here to grab a smoothie to go but i have sat in for breakfast a couple times and its always consistently good ive tried several smoothies and theyre all delicious and for breakfast they have a crazy amount of options to satisfy anyones tastes another thing i really love about rachels kitchen is the service  every time ive been in the employees are genuinely friendly not fake friendly like you get in most places in vegas and have made small talk with me without being overly talkative great place to head to if youre looking for a healthier option for any time of day|the empanadas are ok a lil over priced for what they are location is probably not the greatestits like a hole in the wall type of place with over priced empanadasnot sure if i would go back|excellent coffee for an affordable price  they have a small selection of sandwiches and salads for lunch as well as pastries and a breakfast sandwich  service is fast and friendly  ill be back|i got takeout and was impressed i usually dont like asian fare but it was great the kung pao beef was tasty and not greasy like most places we also liked the firecracker pork rice was a bit al dente for me i will return to try more dishes|this place makes real pizza we order pizza margarita omg supper delicious but a little pricey their size could be bigger we order more slices for each anyway we enjoyed it|this place has fantastic happy hour prices and i love happy hour  i would definetly come back here every week the pizza was fantastic and fresh didnt take long either our fries were a little over done and im quite shocked i would be given old over done fries at all having worked in restaurants but nothing that cant be simply solved still a great place for happy hour to me|fresh hot and delicious   good service good clean space friendly smiling staff  make sure you order the smash fries they are well worth it  i made the mistake of ordering a second patty on a big burger  it made for a huge sandwich that was hard to finish it was delicious and tasty but just a bit too much for one meal|ive been here a few times twice were carry out and once to dine in i love the pizza at this restaurant it is like the type of thin crust pizza that you would find at neighborhood pizza joints in and around chicagoland the ambiance of the restaurant is also pleasant and reminds me of pizza places in chicago a lot of places around arizona that are chicago themed are too over the top with decor that they basically scream chicago little chicago is subtle but familiar to someone who was raised in chicagoland the only thing i did not like about the restaurant was the italian beef sandwich while living in chicago i never ate an italian beef sandwich that had cheese on it to me their italian beef sandwich is more of a philly cheesesteak with thinner meat now that ive tried that i probably wouldnt get it again id rather have an italian beef sandwich from portillos which is right down the street at tempe marketplace all in all i would recommend this place especially for the pizza|great place and great atmosphere went last weekend with family who were from out of town and they want to go back as soon as they visit phx again|first off always do the chopped salad its so much closer for me to get the here too vs cowboy caio i was happy to discover this the reason for   and not  stars is i have had a couple poor drink recommendations from staff for or a reccomendation on a drink that hadnt even tasted special  love the food the salad the lolipops etc dinner is right up to par with the apps i like the drinks too once i just trust my gut the location is fun for people watching and great patio when its warm out|ive had macarons from all over pittsburgh and gaby et jules are the best their prices are expensive but its worth it i havent tried any other of their sweets for their price tags but they are all beautifully presented|went here for the first time for dinner last night i finally found a place that makes agua chiles so i had to get that plus i did the carne asada burrito fully loaded i liked how it wasnt a monster burro and enough for one person i also liked how you got all the i ingredients in one bite and every bite salsa bar was a nice touch the cabbage was brown so that needed some improvement but like the previous reviewer said mix the hot and mild and its the perfect chunky salsa with a kick husband ordered the shrimp burro warningthe secret sauce has mustard flavor didnt expect that in a shrimp burro typically they have a chipotle cream or some kinda creamy sauce surprisingly it actually tasted good just a shock lolthey have a great variety and very clean wouldnt mind going back|i love the food here and the service is normally pretty good never great but good enough when theyre busy sometimes they dont handle the crowds too well but this is still one of my favorite places in pittsburgh|super cool spot gluten free soy free waffle was very good ask for agave instead of syrup atmosphere is dopegreat music old school r  b playing while u work write or eat and the music is at a thinking level lol one to hit up for breakfast fo sho when you are in vegas|ugh the customer service is not great but the food is great if they get it right have asked to speak to a manager numerous times being told the owner is the manager yet no call back   if i ever get a response and see changes i will change my review after leaving three messages you would think the owner would care enough to call back|i love the idea of tiny hip shops all in one mall type settingi love the location gentrifying further reaches of downtowni love the mantis that breathes fire in time with bohemian rhapsodyi love the central playground with a seriously huge climbing structure and a bunch of cool toys for kids big and little hello giant tinkertoysi love some of the dining options pinche tacos sasapops oak  ivy jinju chocolatescool spots local most of them with unique offeringsunfortunately the container park kinda falls short on the actual shopping the stores are tiny of course and highly specialized a sock store flip flops plastic watch shop there are a couple of boutiquey clothes and art shops that are worth visiting and potentially purchasing from but theres a lot of weirdness around it that will probably change out in a few short months when they cant afford the rentstill a cute place to spend some time with the kids or to take out of town visitors once just not really a shopping destination|i liked this place it was friendly and surprisingly busy for a sunday night when i went with my parents|this place is hit or miss for me i have been on a few different occasions and the drinks are always top notch most of the apps are great toobut the main courses have always left something to be desired for me i still hate the note card on the table to mark that you havent had service it shows inexperience and often times youre still waiting to long with the card i typically just for for drinks and apps ill have to try dessert now that i have read a couple reviews on that|i have eaten everything on the menu but the hot dog the eggplant parmesan is my favorite you can go wrong with most items on the menu the service is always friendly marios restaurants all have love in the food areas for improvementim not a big fan of the warm potato salad something is off with the flavor profile this may be a little critical i think it would be great to remove the seeds from the lemons the get caught in my straw there arent any desserts on the menu other than the yummy alcoholic shakes i work so i cant ingest alcohol on my lunch a couple seasonal rotated desserts would be nice|sambalatte torrefazione is where serious coffee lovers unitei just love the huge array of coffees they have practically covering every time of the day one of the things i noticed that stands out is their steampunk selection these coffees are strong ultra smooth and satisfying i ordered the ethiopian simdamo i didnt add much sugar and cream because i wanted to taste the natural flavor of the coffee it had notable citrus accents to it the chocolate biscotti went well with the coffee the chocolate and nutella cappuccinos are amazing its not too sweet that it overpowers the coffee i like the staff that work there they very are cool people they make the place enjoyable to relaxmy only con is the sandwiches they didnt taste fresh and a bit priceythey were shrink wrapped in the refrigerator maybe mine sat there too long i would prefer that they make it in house i have no complaints on the baked goods those taste awesome|i love the fact that you can watch the employees make the bagels from scratch while you wait in line the lines can get pretty long so watching the whole bagel making process will definitely kepp you preoccupied while you wait the prices are a bit higher than your average bagel shop but the bagels are huge so its worth it i ordered an egg and cheese on garlic and it was delicious|good brews coffee kolsh was a winner|we visited the restaurant for an afternoon buffet and found that the appetizers options were adequate but the entree and dessert options were less and also did not look to be fresh considering that we were there around  pm and not at  pm which is what the restaurant serves buffet until|as other reviewers have mentioned the beef dip sandwich is good and its great quality there is some seasoning missing though not sure what it is|good ipas a little hipster and they were out of stickers but still good|the excellent service here tipped this review up to  stars  at  per person with no lunch price this is a pretty pricey for ayce  but kids  and under are free so that is a definite plus for young families  this sushi is decent enough but they are stingy with the fish which made my nigiri very disappointing  the fish is fresh though and my husband raved about their baked mussels because they werent covered in mayonnaise and had a different more flavorful sauce than most place  i also thought the uni nigiri was a lot better than i was expecting at a ayce joint|the good large servings friendly staff fast service good food cool theme total rewards discount  per entreethe bad does not honor vegas bite card really far from rio lobby bathrooms pretty far from restaurant pretty expensive without coupon|great place to watch a game and the best wings in this area they did an awesome job when they renowed this place knowledgable staff|honestly ive been to four different beauticians for a brazilian at this location one girl only broke the the hair off so i was left with hard scratchy spots everywhere and she didnt tweeze after i hope it was one of her first times jackie is by far the best if youre a bit weary about waxing and its your first time i highly recommend her even if youve been waxing for a while now id still recommend her she pulls the strips off in one motion and then puts pressure on the spot she just waxed to alleviate the pain she gets almost all of the hair so she usually wont have to put another strip on a spot she already waxed she also does a great job tweezing whats left so youre completely bare and happy with the work she doesnt skimp out on her job id highly recommend the ingrown hair serum as well it works wonders|very fresh veggies the broth was very flavorful no boba was the only sad note  easy to get to and plenty of parking  spring rolls were good and the peanut sauce was good|fun  we had great views of the strip and a comical knowledgeable and engaging bar tender  my only suggestion would be to skip the  strong shots they give you during the  minute ride  if you take all three you might not have the same fun experience that i did lol|i try the original maine style roller here taste good a lot of lobster and very fresh but undeniable expensive for a sandwich you may have a try if you love lobster their service is ok and they are really hot many people are here you may not get a seat|been there so many times today we asked for the validation tickets for the first time but none of them works we paid  dollar extra for each vehicle service is also disappointing|food is good staff is friendly took us a few attempts to see if they could get it together though we like having a nice italian restaurant around the corner however still a little overpriced|we have been coming here for over a year and suddenly the food has changed  our servicer was great but the food wasnt   we were told they are under new management and new chef   if anyone knows where the original owners and chef are please let me know  we will try it one more time|very enjoyable all you can eat sushi restaurant the food is made to order and the menu has many items for those who do not prefer fish  i will definitely return|delicious the atmosphere is very casual and fun you can make your own burgersandwich whatever you want a lot of the toppings are a  so you have to watch because it can rack up pretty fast it feels a bit to expensive when the bill comes for two people our bill came to  with tip for two burgers a basket of fries and a milkshake going home with all of our extra fries and half a burger though the milkshakes are so good and my favorite would recommend saving room for dessert|i was in need of a gel manicure and i thought i would give mirror mirror a chance i was able to quickly book an appointment  hours later right from the yelp app including the soak off  which i knew i needed my nail tech was very professional hygienic and friendly they had an amazing selection of colors and even do gel nail art if you request  which i will be asking for next time of course  its a little more  than some nail spots  but i am willing to pay more knowing the tools have been sanitized properly and staff is knowledgable about their trade and up to date on the newest styles and techniques due to health conditions my nails already run on the weak and thin side  so i appreciate someone that will be gentle and take extra time to give my nails the attention they need ill be returning to mirror mirror and would recommended it |i was expecting the old silver dragon and was disappointed the food was okay but didnt have much flavor the curry chicken was bland and the hotsour soup didnt have much heat the hong kong beef was wonderful though the beef was so tender and delicious also the bathroom was disgusting with the urinal having a leak that was fixed with paper towels|good selection of breakfast and brunch items cool place with great service the left coast blt was very interesting and quite good pasta salad was pretty bland and nothing to write home about mac n cheese was unique and tasty however it was very heavy left us feeling ready to take a nap price was reasonable happening place for brunch strongly suggested|sams serves up a solid sub  get over the fact they practically have no signage and are hidden in the back of a chevron gas station because the subs are made proper  i ordered a footlong miami fatboy with hot peppers it was really good  i love that my sandwich was drenched in oil and vinegar and topped with oregano the meats and cheese were quality and the bread selection was nice  the footlong itself was stout worth every penny of  and change price tag  bring cash because your credit cards are no good here|the crispy chicken skins were good taste like mesquite bbqflavored chips but were too salty and just had too much of the spice coating on them  the mac n cheese was very good too but it would have been better to have ordered it at another time because it too was fairly salty although still very good  the gyro tacos were excellent as was the glazed doughnut bread pudding  the place is very hard to find no signage and you enter from carson st not th as the address would suggest  smallish place but had a good vibe we sat at the kitchen bar and got to chat with the bread chef glad we got there early pm otherwise there would probably have been quite a wait|carson kitcheniced teawok

are missing from meat and salad and quantity is reduced|when i want local pizza like home in nj i come here the house salad dressing and cannoli are awesome too the crust on the pizza is just right|i havent really found a ramen place that i like in town this one comes the closest to being a favorite growing up in japan and eating ramen frequently from different shops i like to say that im pretty particular when it comes to ramen i had the karaage ramen it was definitely different from what id usually have but it was either ramen and karaage or karaage ramen i chose the latter obviously i also had them add am egg and corn to my ramen which is a little extra in cost but thats typical from ramen joints the chicken soaked up some of the broth which added extra flavor to the chicken it still had somewhat of a crispy outside and still was good with beer oh if you didnt know already karaage in japan is usually eaten with beer its like the japanese equivalent to bar food the ramen was perfect as far as not being too soft or too hard which is always a plus im sure if you ask theyll make it the way you like it but i like that perfect in between i forgot how much my bill was but it was exactly as i expected as far as cost to qualityservice the service was spot on and i wasnt bothered too much or too little i cant wait to go back and try other things|been to publicus for brunch and for an afternoon snack and overall i love itthe staff goes above and beyond to be friendly and helpful and the vibe inside is pretty hip theyve got that industrial rustic thing going which is so hot right nowits pretty casual order at the counter and they bring the food out to you we sampled a ton of their brunch offerings and all were really great i think the vegetables on all the dishes stood out to mei also enjoyed their selection of coffees and teas and tried the ginger london fog on the baristas recommendation very good and uniquewhere they fell short surprisingly was the pastries we had the brookie brownie cookie and the chocolate chip cookie they werent nasty or anything but they just werent greatif in my neighborhood id be a regular hereill definitely be back to order lunch

good great selection on the menu and great selection of drinks incredible piano player there which provided some eating music restaurant is a good size especially for big parties|if you are looking for the rare andor interesting ciclid this is the place to go the store is not showy but the tanks are clean and the fish are healthy the owner i forget his name sorry was exceptionally friendly not exactly a place for the beginner interested in setting up their first aquarium but the owner will definitely take time to help you|i was able to go here with my uncle because he had a free meal voucher here through parisi enjoyed my experience over all but i feel like the prices do not match the ambiance the ambiance looks like a lower class italian restaurant whereas the prices match something more elegant i feel like they couldnt decide which direction they wanted to go in i ordered the three course meal paired with wine for the first course the wine was paired with the food but for the next two courses our food came before the wine i feel that the wine should have been brought out first so i could enjoy it throughout the whole meal instead of having to wait for it i also wanted to order a coke but our waiter was never in sight i probably saw every other server but him he was nice but i just felt he was absent when we needed him side note i never ended up ordering the cokethe food was good though i started with the meatball which was tender and paired with red sauce and peppers for the second course i ordered bucatini with red sauce that was also good and i was lucky enough to have leftovers to take to work the next day for dessert i ordered their cannoli i loved it and paired with the sweet dessert wine it tasted really good good food just ok service and ambiance i enjoyed it here but just sub par|friendlyish staffim not a stickler for service but they ought to be more careful the way they place food on their patrons table ill give them the benefit of the doubt and assume they were in a bit of a rushfood wise i had the chance to try the french toast turkey sandwich and the turkey swiss crepethe turkey sandwich and crepe needed more seasoning i would choose the crepe over the sandwich the french toast was perfect|if i didnt know any better id think this food court was simply harrahs twist on the casino buffet you have different counters for various cuisines none done especially well but a step better than they need to be prices are on par with casino cafes and unfortunately the sushi is grocerystore gradecoffee counter offers lavazza and subpar baked goods sandwiches and pizza slices can be assembled or heated to order froyo flavors are predictable asian station is slightly above your usual food court vendors healthier option with fresh veggies and the aforementioned sushi counter does offer a prepacked sashimi plate if youre only a little bit hungry or with a group this area is probably an economical option to satisfy all cravingsinterestingly the food court offerings seem to be careful not to step on the toes of other resident restaurants this area does not offer any type of burger instead signage reminds you that toby keiths is right upstairs if you simply must have one|the acai fruit along with other superfoods has gained a lot of attention recently  thats okay when places like acai to the t appear on the scene  only recently opened this place seems to know what it wants to be  your neighborhood shop to get your acai or pitaya fix in the form of bowls smoothies and juice  so far its been a great experience  go in and youll find yourself in a simple place with a trendy air about it and a very nice staff  the ladies who work behind the counter are super personable and do a good job of remembering returning customersthe bowls come in two sizes but dont be fooled the regular size is filling  you have a number of menu choices for what goes in your bowl  if youre in the mood for a smoothie you can also go that route along with a number of additives to enhance your order  the ladies will also let you substitute fruits on top if you need to or preferthe only odd thing about the store is where the menu is located and where to order  dont sweat it  walk in go to the back look at the large menu then proceed to the register to order and pay  no big deal  theyll work out the signage and flow im sureyou can enjoy your order right there or take it to go  just grab a lid from the counter if you need to bolt  if your plan is to sit a while keep in mind theres very limited seating inside the shopif you like acai or pitaya give this place a try  if youre looking for a recommendation try the berry good or rise and shine bowls  i think your mouth will be happy|this is my goto spot for any unique sandwiches their menu is very creative and i like the atmosphere in the restaurant service is always outstanding and the food is as good as it sounds|this completely upsets me to leave  stars but in order to leave  the experience would have to be perfect the experience with the front desk is where a star was lost doctorsas far as doctors go id rank these as top in the country as ive been to many all over the us and highly recommend this group dr adashek is my doctor and not only is he an expert in his field but his bedside manners make you feel comfortable and safe ive recommended dr adashek to my friends who were becoming moms and one actually switched obgyns because her doctor was not making her pregnancy a time to remember so dr adashek took her in his care after many conversations and she had such a great experience that she wants more children just because of the wonderful care she received i learned that after speaking to others that they used dr adashek to deliver their babies and continue to stay under his care front office staffdepending on which office you decide to go to the front staff can be nice  professional to notsowelcoming i know they deal with a lot of emergencies however its their job and their response to a situation sets the stage to how a patient is going to feel prior to seeing the nurse or doctor i have found that in all of the offices they are quite chatty and if you walk up to the counter after checking in they make you feel like youre interrupting i truly believe that the front office is the face of any organization and can make or break an experience nursing staffthe nursing staff is without question friendly upbeat professional courteous and creates a comfortable environment in an uncomfortable situation i couldnt praise or thank them enoughoverall i would highly recommend desert perinatal associates|great threading salon possibly the best one ive been to so far i have very sensitive skin and my skin tends to get very red and irrated even with threading prefer it over waxing etc told her and immediately told me what i needed baby powder prior to thread would give  stars if only more than one employee present however highly reccomend great service very satisfied|i came here for a work christmas party recently and i love the ambiance here it kind of reminds of honey salt which is also in summerlinwhile i think it is on the pricy side i was there for a christmas party so i didnt have to worry about paying  the service was very good they came over several times throughout our meal and checked on us and made sure we were enjoying our experience they also took our picture a couple of times when we asked which was nice of themi have to say i enjoyed their appetizers and small bites more than my actual meal i would love to come back and try more of them because they were hard to choose from because they all looked so goodwe decided to start off with the hummus mac and cheese and the dates i have to say the dates were my favorite out of all three they were served with red sauce which was a great pairing the mac and cheese was great for splitting since it was very heavy the hummus was good but my least favoritewe then also decided to order the deviled eggs omg they were probably the best denied eggs i have ever have and they looked so pretty when they were servedif i came back i would have to order the dates and the eggs againi then ordered the tomato basil soup so good and creamy it was also served with a tiny grilled cheese sandwich that was great for dipping i ordered a pasta dish but i dont recall the name by that time i was pretty full and probably didnt need to order this i took it home for my uncle to try i did however save room for dessert we tried the honey olive oil cake and the milk chocolate souffle the souffle was just ok to me but i really enjoyed the olive oil cake the olive oil made it very moist it was served with blood orange sherbet which felt kind of odd as a pairing but still tasted goodi enjoyed the dining experience i will be back to try more apps and dessert|very affordable   i love the corn tamales and the fried bananas  the ham and eggs is also well done  however try the pupusas   its a thick tortilla with beans and cheese or mixed with pork  i think this place has some of the better ones in vegas   the service is slow because its not too full and obviously trying to save on help but i think the food is fantastic and as this place grows so will its service|this is a great little spot that i finally tried after living so close to it for years i was pleasantly surprised as the ambiance is great as soon as you walk in the food is great especially since theres no real italian food in this area you cant go wrong with anything on the menu but definitely have one of their cocktails with dinner ive since been back just for a casual drink and appetizer at their bar|my friend and i happened to stumble in here by accident the other night and im sort of glad we did because i forgot how much i love tea their outside sample of white chocolate peppermint had me sold and remembering my mom gave me her perfect tea maker not to long ago my friend and i had to buy some christmas tea the manager in the santa hat was funny but also annoying when he was trying to sell us everything in the darn store i was ecstatic to find out i could use my starbucks card there which for some reason i had no idea that starbucks owns teavana later in the week my perfect tea maker stopped working so i brought it in and the nice kid working the register recycled my old one and gave me a new working one which i really appreciated i didnt really care if they could fixed the old one i just wanted one that worked either way i definitely have my tea addiction back and will return here after christmas and stock up on more tea|worm is not a fan of your bbq mac and cheese you should step it up  i awarded you  stars because i myself did not taste the bbq mac and cheese but i fully trust worm  he would not say it was good in theory if it was good in real life  worm is a stand up guy even with a tricky back|very good servicevery cleaanvery very expensivenot for people of colors tastebudsno taste no seasoning no spices no flavor fish however if you dont care for funky smelling fishy tasting seafood this is done very pure but bland then this is the spot for you  restaurant always empty hence the groupon probably cole slaw to die for but bring your own tatar sauce theres taste  like ranch dressing|food here was very good had the giant meatball fried chicken fingers and the fried shrimp all of the dishes came out smoking hot and fresh the wait staff was extremely attentive drink glasses rarely got empty great atmosphere for a date|mehsoft drinks cost  everywhere in the food court wtf for a sammy got the hawaiian it was ok not great mediocre and overpriced kind of put me in a bad mood combo for chips and a drink is  seriously ok charge  but it better be amazing its notoh well|yummy yummy gelato i think im  just loving that they make these little flowers when you get a cone here thats what sets them aprt from the other ice cream gelato places i will say the prices are pretty expensive but its really worth ithazelnut and pistachio are my faves|good food dessert section had varied items to try|this restaurant offers local craft beer inhouse prepared meats farmer fresh dishes and hardier chef crafted fair the atmosphere is roomy and comfortable and service was friendly and efficient on my last two visitswe started sharing a half order of the three cheddar two ale cheese and mac with truffled parm crust no denying this dish was tasty and layered with flavors and texture due to the delicate tasty crust bursting with truffle essencei came back to try the wild walleye in beer batter it came with a very tasty fresh slaw that was heavy with celery seeds and other flavors nicely seasoned tarter sauce and a mountain of hand cut fries i got a very generous amount of meaty mild fresh tasting fish in a beer laced batter i thought all the flavors were delicious but i think the batter was slightly off being donut like in texture and thats the reason im lowing the  stars to  stars because the batter was still good but not perfect i looked at photos from other peoples walleye and i do see i didnt get what they got i do note that i feel that this is a very good restaurant to eat at and on my visit possibly due to someone new cooking or a slight slip in the recipe i got something less than what they normally servei was absolutely blown away with what i ordered last time and hope to bring them back up to five stars next time|after attending hotel monacos opening soiree i was given an offer i couldnt refuse for an overnight stay so off to the monaco me and jonathan d went for our annual holidate we checked in promptly at pm and were given a room on the nd floor upon arrival in our room i noticed that there was quite a bit of noise coming from the surrounding buildings being on the nd floor and facing strawberry way it was unavoidable so i did something i hate to do  i called the front desk and asked for a different room the gentleman i spoke with was very nice and promised to call back still awaiting a call and itching to get going on our date we headed downstairs where i inquired about a different room in person the woman i spoke with was so helpful and assigned us a room on the opposite side of the building on a higher level after moving our bags we stopped at the complimentary happy hour for wine beer and cookies  what a way to start the night then it was off to a staycation around the city before returning home for a good nights sleep courtesy of the comfy kimpton bed  aside from the tiny elevators and noise level on the lower levels i give two thumbs up to this great new addition to the burgh|crave those crazy squares not breakfast cereal white castle burgers if you didnt grow up with this chain you dont get it yeah the meat is a superthin mystery but its a nostalgia thing theres nothing like the wc flavor summers in ohio with my cousins would always end with a trip here back home in texas my dad would crave them and have to settle for the frozenaisle version finally vegas got an outpost the prices are jacked up for the strip location but the taste is all  it really is a trip to finally be able to taste real white castle burgers again hot fresh crusted in onion bits and topped with a single pickle you gotta get them with cheese for the full effect add ketchup at your own riskservice is pretty organized the kitchen is open and everyone is working hard order numbers are both called out and posted on a screen somehow i got skipped but they remade my order and tossed in dessert too|stopped in for a drink  bar was disorganized and therefore we couldnt get the drinks we wanted they couldnt find the ingredients apparently last night the bar got destroyed yeah that was  hrs ago restock its not that hard good drinks if you can get them but it is loud|i stopped by here earlier today for lunch with my father  we had been in the previous bbq shop to grace this spot and enjoyed it so whenever i saw that a new one had opened up we headed over to brookline to give it a try  the inside of the restaurant wasnt that much different than in its previous incarnation  as soon as you walk in there is seating for about  or so people on the right with picnic plaid covering the tables and then there is a counter right in front of you  other than that this place has a cool feel to it as the walls have a distressed look and there are a number of older signs on the wall including a cocacola sign that looks like it was used for target practice at one point in timefor lunch i decided to order the special of the day which was the sam and ema brisket pulled pork and coleslaw sandwich and for my side i decided on the mac and cheese  my father ended up going with the pulled pork sandwich and at the last minute changed his side to the fries  after only about a  minute wait during which my father and i enjoyed watching the price is right on the only tv in the restaurant our food was brought out to us  my meal came out first and the first thing that i noticed was how huge it was  the sandwich was simply massive and i knew right away that it wasnt going to be easy to keep it on the bun  that proved to be the only downfall of the sandwich as well because both the brisket and pulled pork were tender moist and had a great smoky flavor to them  the cole slaw was a nice addition as well as it gave the sandwich some extra moisture but that also caused the sandwich to collapse about half way through eating it and i ended up finishing it with my fork  the sam  since the bun was fairly mushy and was not toasted at|ill start by pointing out the positives of our visit the margaritas packed a punch and were very tasty we started with queso as an appetizer the homemade tortilla chips are to die for and the dip was delicious for entrees we had the pork tacos chicken apple tacos slaw and mac n cheese  stars for the chicken tacos slaw and mac n cheese our waiter was very friendly and helpful now the negatives the hostess was super pissy with us the service was slow and scattered we enjoyed our waiter so perhaps the kitchen was to blame for that the pork in the pork tacos was flavorless and incredibly dry|stumbled upon hexx kitchen  bar when looking for a nice brunch spot during my stay in vegas that wasnt a buffet and yelp led me here located off the strip across from the bellagio fountains hexx focuses on fresh quality approachable american cuisine with extensive drink options oh and its attached to a candy store as well whats not to like about thati loved the atmosphere modern cozy homey vibe that made you feel like you were in someones house casually sitting down for a good meal as we settled in we pursued the brunch menu and i actually had trouble picking what i wanted because everything looked so good to me after some rounds of coffee i opted for the ham and cheese croissant which our server recommended and i was not displeased in my decision it was a huge sandwich with aged gooey cheddar a nice helping of black forest ham and a nice soft and warm croissant bun served with a side of their home fries seemed like the perfect way to start my morning as  i was completely satisfied with what i ate and now was ready to get my day started and although the candy kitchen seemed very tempting i had to restrain myself since i was still basking in my brunch pleasure and it seemed too early for that until next timegive this place a shot for great food views and atmosphere when you dont want to eat at a buffet|the nutella crepes were amazingly delicious definitely going back also the blt was yummy very clean place and the server was fast happy with great customer service  very happy with their service over all|great food and awesome customer service  as a fan of the other chicken and waffle spot that shall not be named here we made the trek out to rhemas to compare  and so glad we did  the red velvet waffle was beyond yummy and made the entire trip worth it  we tried the mac  cheese greens and fries  the mac  cheese is a must  i probably wont get the fries by themselves again but do have plans to try the symphony fries one daythe owners were extremely friendly and welcoming the wife took the time to walk us through the entire menu without hestitation and made great recommendations  we we will be back to try the rest of the menuthe location is tucked away and a bit hard to find the first time better signage from the street view may help|nicely displayed dishes but the taste is not as sophisticated as the presentation i had sturgeon the beat appetizer and the chocolate moose the sturgeon tasted like simple salmon and the chocolate moose was too watery the signature drink was ok but very strong the service was mixed we had a reservation at the entrance no one was waiting to seat us after a bit of hesitation we decided to go inside and see what we should do we almost were entering the kitchen area at the back of the restaurant when someone finally told us to sit somewhere it was a tuesday night and the restaurant was not busy at all but the rest of the service that night was good|i have to say i really like this place my boyfriend got me and my mom hooked on the chicken yakisoba with a side of their dynamite sauce just delicious and the right amount of spicy today we tried out their vegetable  shrimp tempura as well as a rainbow sushi roll their tempura batter is on point actually much more flavorful than a lot of sushi restaurants i also loved the sauce it came with which was a blend of dynamite sauce and a sort of sweet teriyaki blend just delish and a great compliment to the tempura mix i will most definitely order it again the rainbow roll was pretty good generous amount of fish which was very fresh i still prefer kazuki sushi but for a quick fix this most definitely satisfies the craving the cook really took his time prepping our to go meal which honestly i didnt mind at all i actually really appreciate that level of patience pride and service that was taken to ensure a good experience if youre going to be pressed for time definitely call and order ahead i will definitely be returning the only reason i didnt give  stars is due to the price point although with the quality of food and service i can overlook the price once in awhile|petit resto mexicain tout simple avec une super ambiance  nous avons command les tacos rosarito aux crevettes panes pas mal et au boeuf grill ribeye dur

freshly roasted coffee that is roasted right in house mothership coffee is a great place to stop if you are in the area and looking for some great coffee you wont be disappointed|my boyfriend and i had el fish taco bookmarked since we saw all of its great reviews and for our love of tacos we were excited when we finally came in we were expecting the typical taqueria but its actually a casual sitdown restaurant once you walk in they allow you to select your own seating then they come to you with the menus woah the menu is priceeeyyy the tacos are  each omg lol i mean they do have some interestingbizzare tacos you wont find really anywhere else but its still pretty pricey i opted for the surf  turf taco and since many people on yelp enjoy their costras i also ordered the al pastor shrimp costra whats a costra its like a melted grilled cheese taco with your choice of meat it was decent the two didnt fill me up so i also ordered the fish  chips taco i ordered tacos i thought were interesting my boyfriend got the chipotle shrimp burrito everything tasted good but they definitely are not worth the price tbh i would rather opt for a cheaper joint with good tacos if they drop their prices to typical prices we may come back but we both agreed its just too much for okay food|this is a tiny market but filled with lots of goodies when you walk in there is a coffee shop on your right on your left is a mini french bakerythe main item being macaroons there is a small cold case that has a nice variety of beer there is a deli case with prepared foods everything looked tasty there is a small freezer with a few types of icecream one was a local pittsburgh ice cream way to represent  there is a dairy case and then a section where you could grab premade sandwiches and salads  the prices are a bit high but the quality of their items make it worth it if i lived downtown this is definitely where i would shop|great vibes for sure went on a monday night and it wasnt too crowded really enjoyed my pretzel and cheese|i am a chipotle fanatic and am destined to try chipotles everywhere look not much to say about this place other than the fact yes the food was alright did not notice anything wrong with it but wow the staff is just not cutting it the store is pretty much a walk in order and leave type of place and its small so the fact they had  workers at one time is bizarre because my trip and my friends separate trip we both waited and our process took  minutes each like what also i asked for extra rice and i received regular amount of rice not a fan of that cashier was unexperienced and took way too long sorry as a chipotle believer i was let down get it together|really tasty authentic hot food you wont be disappointed with no real decor or ambience price is not really nominal for dinnervery friendly service give it a try|first time eating here  all you can eat for  is not a bad deal  we went after the dinner rush or so i thought on a weeknight but still had to wait a good  minutes for a table  service was less than average  the quality of meat was alright  serving size of rice could use an upgrade  what asian doesnt enjoy their rice  serving it in a very very small bowl makes one have to repeatedly ask the wait staff to bring out more  could never find the wait staff when i ran low on rice or drinks  however cant beat the price  i may come back|its a cute small place i dont really get much or do much here its a nice study spot for about the first  hours from opening but after that it gets to be pretty busy and becomes very difficult to be productive but its definitely better than some of the other coffee shops which get way too loud for my tastesi usually just get tea since im not a big coffee drinker the teas so far have been pretty good you can ask them for suggestions and theyre usually spot on the staff is very friendly and provide more service then i expected theyre pretty spot on and i enjoy talking to them before i get down to work when theyre not so busy they some times bring over little snacks for people to try and ask for opinions which is pretty cool theyre definitely my go to spot when i need out of the house and gotta study for a few hours|in vegas ramen scene omoide noodles  bowls falls short of the competition i just feel the ramen is ok at best nothing spectacular jaw dropping and memorable i ordered the tonkatsu ramen with my lunch special the broth for me just lacked flavor or any kind or depth my normal go to spots the tonkatsu ramen feel more heavier broth unlike one here is water down and lacked any kind of depth or distinct flavor the toppings get nice amount like any other ramen spot in vegas ramen it starts and ends with the broth unfortunately did not work for me next time i will try order shoyu broth the curry bowl that was five star experience it japanese style brown curry right off the back my favorite style curry it delivered on point i just wished ordered bigger bowl  i love the fact even for side dish for the lunch special not skimpy came to the portion size the curry has nice amount of chicken and vegetables in it the house salad that came with the lunch special was good i enjoyed the vinaigrette style dressing on it lunch special talk about steal of deal  there no way can go wrong in life bowl of noodles choice side and drink plus house salad i know plan on coming back again just for the lunch special and more curry bowl actionthe decor is pretty cool thinking for small restaurant off the strip in tiny strip shopping mall omoide had tons tons of personality right from the moment you walk in with the ramen bar set up if by yourself great spot get your noodles on the cool lights and the japanese advertisement with everything in japanese definitely nothing like you would think from the outside the service was five star they were awesome explaining everything being first timer and going over the lunch special cause talk about options not just lunch specials the regular menu has nice diversity|looking for a place for a quick bite to eat while driving through phoenix we were not overly hungry so this looked like a perfect place a couple of small pizzas would hit the spot the good attractive modern decor restaurant was welllaid out and had plenty of room for large or small parties staff was very friendly and answered questions even when it was the same question fully and completely nice layout of ingredients lots of variety for just about anything you would want on your pizza wife ordered a salad which she said was goodthe bad sorry to say this but the pizza even with a nice mix of toppings it was bland and lacked flavor even though i picked up the pizzas as soon as they came out of the oven by the time i got to the table they looked like they had been sitting out under a heat lamp for several hours maybe they did t cook it enough maybe the oven was offi dont know given the reviews on here i would be willing to give it another shot if i am in the area i would hope for better food|i have to admit i do like this place i had take out today for myself and it was damn good really quick way to order and waited only a couple of minutes for my pizza they ran out of boxes but they used two smaller ones and that worked out just fine i will be back|i really enjoyed my lunch at the new black dog  a fantastic build out in the old train depot downtown  inside is narrow with all wood and a few tvs  the bar runs almost the entire length inside so plenty of seats there with a few booths and high top tables  high ceilings and windows all around as well which makes the place feel a little more open than the narrow area suggests  love the atmospherei showed up about  am and there was plenty of seats available  though that filled up quickly  sitting at the bar i had no issues with the service  food came out before i knew it and piping hot  the bartender also new the beer list and we talked a bit about the cask offerings  this and the urbana location might be the only place in the area that does cask now  which is a shame  anyway ordered the burnt ends sandwich  topped with coleslaw and the carolina red vinegar based sauce  i am not a huge fan of coleslaw by itself but put it on a sandwich and that makes all the difference  the sauce had the perfect vinegary kick and the burnt ends are just damn good  along with a side of pit beans that were hot smoky and sweet  the burnt ends sell out pretty much everyday  however they are always ready at opening and again at pm taps with two cask offerings as i said above  i dont know if i have ever seen north coast red seal on cask and it was in good condition  with the rest of the tap selection running from founders to the bruery  along with blind pig one of the better beer bars in the area i have always thought the urbana location was very good if not excellent though maybe a little overrated  though the burnt ends are very much on point here  a great beer bar and really good bbq place in downtown champaign|not too bad of a dining experience  the service was good and helpful and the place nicely decorated with a peaceful ambiance  mostly because of that i couldnt bring myself to give them  stars  however the food was only ok  the chop salad had way too much red onions  and the chicken marsala need more spices for flavor  it was a nice surprise that by just checking in on yelp the restaurant offered you a free appetizer   however only valid in the bar and lounge area only  so with our party of  in the dining area the offer was not valid  too bad wouldve given an extra star for the nice gesture   most likely would not dine here again  other italian places in town way better in town square or at fashion show mall|been to public school twice  the service is great and food is exceptional  we will definitely go back|great place for all kinds of sweets the coffee is good too i will def be going back here to support this local business|i love the atmosphere here and the donuts  also the coffee omg i wish i lived closer|crispy great donuts staff eager to please free wifi  for styrofoam coffee cups and other unnecessary fittings|i ordered a shrimp po boy and it was pretty good the decor reminds me of louisiana and  the service is very good here they are all very attentive next time i will try the seafood by the pound|very nice establishment with friendly staff members had no clue what to expect my first time going for the d brow service luckily she was very knowledgable and informative before and after the procedure i would recommend this place to my closest family and friends very satisfied customer|i was craving for sushi and didnt really want to drive to the other side of town for sakana i didnt have to wait for seating i had the ayce ordered poke saba salmon albacore saba and uni sushi this place is quite a disappointment the proteins were thinly sliced and so it is the typical huge chunk of rice to little protein ratio i gotta say their uni was fresh though service was really slow considering that there are only  parties in the restauranti may or may not be back but i dont really recommend this place|great ticket prices and a coke freestyle machine help this theater set itself apart from others in the area the place was recently remodeled with better seats too its trying to be a premium theater like the galaxy at the cannery but its not on the same level the sound system isnt as good and the reclining seats are a lower quality than other premium theaters but the ticket prices are definitely better if you want the premium experience at a lower price this is the theater for you|cheap movie a bit of a distance from the strip but worth it for the drive i like that the seats are recliners and it is reserved seating i dont think it is as clean as other amcs since there were popcorn and other stuff on the floor i realized it is cheaper here versus other theaters in los angeles so that was kind of nice i dont usually venture to go watch a movie when im in vegas but i wanted to watch star wars so this was the perfect venue|bbq chicken pizza this is the second most popular dish according to the server so i figured why not im not sure how healthy it is but it tasted like a regular pizza or one you might get at cpk california pizza kitchen im not a huge fan of cpk or anything but maybe the flavors reminded me of it service was amazing|first time doing an ayce the variety is very good all the rolls were great the andy was our favorite fried rice a bit too greasy for my taste   service was spotty one server was on top of it the other not so much overall really good value and variety we will return|so grateful that theres a local portillos now ive been with people who arent from chicago and they thought the ordering process was weird but to me it was normal since i grew up with it portillos has it down to a science on how to get orders out as efficiently as possible regardless of how many customers are there the only thing i order is the italian beef with hot peppers on the side and it is exactly like the sandwich you would get at a portillos around chicago the only con to my review has to do with the physical location of the restaurant itself its in a really weird corner of tempe marketplace which is hard or maybe not possible to get to from the main parts of tempe marketplace without going on mcclintock or rio salado|my burger was pink all the way throughvery dangerous with ground beef against the law in new york state to serve an under cooked burger fries are seasoned fries not real fries i never salt my foodwhy should the cook presume i want a ton of salt on my friesdiscustinga burger joint that doesnt searve real friesforget it|i was lucky enough to attend a social function recently at the madison blind i had been in the graduate before but this was my first time at their rooftop barrestaurant  one of my favorite parts of the graduate is the overall ambience of the lobby and presumably the rooms i was super impressed with the cool design of the lobby of the madison blind as well as the fun plaid bathrooms and the bar with its subway tile and beautiful lighting  the actual restaurant seems a bit understated compared to everything else  its pretty simple and plain but perhaps they were going for something sleeker and cleaner compared to the rest of their super eclectic decorating  i did not eat a full meal at the madison blind however i tried a few appetizers and some wine  the food i did eat was very good and the servers were all incredibly friendly and fun  after taking a peek at their full menu i am excited to go back and try of course their cheese curds  im always on the lookout for the next best cheese curd in madison i also love that while the menu is fairly small they offer a number of different vegetarian options our event was in the evening so i did not get a chance to see the views from the rooftop nor did i venture out in the cold to really check it out but i can assure you i will be back when the weather is nicer i talked for awhile with the general manager  of the graduate and he invited me back with my family  saying that it is a very kid friendly place which is nice to to know though i dont know that i completely believe him  my kids seem a little too crazy for such this nice calm space  i am looking forward to going back during the day in the summer and getting the full experience|located at the grand bazaar shops this japanese food place is amazing ramen curry and sushi burritos whatever you would like to order its quick and oh so good i work at paris and ballys and need a quick asian fix so here is the place to be if you cant make it in time in spring mountain|little nook tucked away on the side of the strip next to ballys came here to eat on a recommendation from a nearby store worker spicy miso ramen was meh the pork chop fried rice was pretty bad the pork chops you could taste werent fresh and were soggy and then ramen broth was a little gummy almost prices were relatively affordable in comparison to the rest of the strips prices however i would give this place a two star if it werent for the incredible staff they were so friendly and some were actually japanese if that means anything and constantly checked up on us in the little back barseat area even though theyre mostly a takeout place they were all so kind and sweet and helped us decide what to order from the menu if most of the sushi burritos were wrapped in seaweedsoy paper instead of a tortilla i probably would have gotten those not bad for quick and cheap lunch though|new and renovated skyfall formally known as mix the decor is very retro kind of a james bond feel i dig it  the seating completely caters to the view with half circle sectionals the balcony has heaters to stay warm while you snap a few quick selfies with the gorgeous backdrop of the strip there is no more dance floor given i came on a monday night in december slowest season in vegas i still would like to see a dance floor i know they have djs certain days but if there is no dance floor then whats the point i think the decision to axe the dance floor was a fail i ordered the sliders comes with two sliders and french fries the sliders a cute from first glance tithe presentation was there they also taste good however the bun was a little to crispy that it was hard to bite into it once i was able to chomp down half the ingredients fell into my lap thankfully i had a napkin there it was just a little too messy taste good but messy all in all ill have to come back during the busy season and see if theyve made a dance floor or not|tonight we dined here after a friend recommended this restaurant we ordered the standard lamb kebab panner tikka and chicken curry with a couple of rotisfood quantity  is small compared to the price so if you have a average eating appetite then these servings are small you will need more which means the bill goes up  items are really pricy  lamb kebab were  for  small pieces of lamb chicken curry was  less then  ounce of curry  oh also there is no rice included this is a pricy menu the taste was ok nothing that would stand out maybe to new indian cuisine diner it maybe a great but for indians this is an outright average north indian flavor servicewas great that is why i give it three stars otherwise it would be lower there was only one employee on duty and he was the server  busser  matrede all in one he was prompt respectful and efficient overall i would rate this a pretty avg clean local north indian restaurant with similar menu items as all other north indian restaurants|really nice decor good california style mexican food large portions and good quality  the pork chile verde burrito is large very spicy with great flavor and tender meat the carne asada tacos are larger than street tacos and very filling make sure to try the original margarita| for a taco plate and chimichanga and one glass of wine nothing special in the menu same thing offered anywhere the decor was authentic but the poor wait staff  kitchen is up  flights of stairs i tipped extra just because i felt sorry for them|great atmosphere staff is excellent i recommend the enchiladas del mar they also have karaoke nights if you want to stick around after dinner|after attending the jingle bell silent auction and winning a gift card here i took my friend out for dinner before our movie and it was not bad but i had high expectations to try this place and it was a quite disappointing for  we both got fries burgers small soda fountain drinks and i also grabbed a bag of bones to take home to my pugs the food was very low quality my shroom burger since i dont eat beef and it sounded delicious  tasted ok but it wasnt worth  by itself  maybe if the fries came with it i technically also ordered the cheese fries just to try and the cheese was this weird melted american cheese with a bland taste to it nothing special to them and very boring i officially dont see what the hype about this place is will i come back sure but is it worth the money being spent who knows maybe i just went during a bad time or the staff is still new and learning but for  i was not satisfiedi also am concerned with their cashier system it took our cashier  minutes to figure out how to use my gift card and instead of asking someone else like her manager for help she just kept yelling at her screen and then finally showed us why she couldnt do her job correctly which made the entire  minutes just awkward we also were the only ones who had to get up to get their food and then this one employee walked around the entire place passing me  times before finally realizing it was me to give me the bag of bones i had ordered a while back such an awkward time but ill come back|the fast food playing field is changing drastically the era of fast food chains getting away with serving mediocre food cooked in greasy oil with impersonal service in a sterile environment designed to get you in and out is facing intense competition from the newer generation of fast food chains this new generation of fast food chains is being led by shake shack five guys and smash burger    after hiking in calico basin and the streets of downtown summerlin my brother and i were up for a posthike dinner in shake shack i had been looking forward to biting into a smokestack burger in recent times i had visited shake shack four times and  developed an appreciation for their smokeshack burger    just like downtown summerlin is the future of the regional shopping mall shake shack is the future of the fast food restaurant my experience describes dining in a futuristic fast food restaurant after ordering from the menu on the wall not over a counter the friendly cashier presented me with a beeper instead of waiting by a counter for other people or hearing order numbers go off the gentle buzz of a beeper went off when the food was ready the dining room is an environment that encouraged me to relax this is totally disparate from a sundry of the fast food restaurants walled with plate glass windows overlooking the highway where the psychological message has been to eat up and get back on the road in shake shack the interior feels more like a casual full service restaurant than a fast food restaurant from my table i overlooked a couple of close caption hd tv sets playing football and shriek if it was a warm day i could of sat outside in the patio overlooking the beautiful arroyo park in downtown summerlin whether i sat inside or outside there was an employee offering to dump my garbage and if i really wanted to relax instead of a coke with my crinkly fries i could have enjoyed a draft beer biting into a smokestack burger was more than enough to make me relax     shake shack has been consistent with quality in similar fashion to the past three visits the smoke shack burger elevated my taste buds that  angus beef between two soft buns were the delicious prime ingredients that complimented applewood bacon red peppers and that mysterious shake shack sauce the crinkly cut fries were good but not nathans greatness    it seems that las vegans including yours truly daniel s love shake shack but shake shack is doing a winco business strategy where they build a couple of restaurants that require  people to drive a distance to come to them currently the only other las vegas location is in new york  new york   speaking of new york  new york i want to clarify a major shake shack misconception there is a misconception that shake shack is the in n out burger of new york and they are all over the new york metropolitan area not true at all i grew up in new york and never heard of them throughout my young adulthood there was a few locations in the city only recently did they expand to the suffolk county suburbs of new york they are totally different from in n out shake shack goes for around  where in n out is about half the price shake shack offers several different items where in n out offers a few from growing up in new york i feel thar white castle would be comparable to in n out  on the other hand what is the antithesis of a misconception is that shake shack is fantastic with all the four star reviews including this one it is foreseeable to walk into this futuristic fast food restaurant and set eyes on the people love us on yelp  sticker|not a bad place for dinner some friends suggested this place for a double date on a friday night we were told it was about a  hour wait but im pretty sure we sat down quicker the bar kept us company while we waitedwe started out with the dutch bitterballen for appetizers it was definitely a change in our usual calamari choice my wife really enjoyed the curry ketchup and roasted garlic aioli it came with she mixed them together too the curry ketchup can definitely overpower it if you put a tad bit too muchmy wife ordered the belgian butter burger because the bone marrow butter intrigued her they werent joking when they said bone marrow butter she was confused that it was smack right on top of her burger she removed some of it and used it on the side instead she loved it but she likes stuff like bone marrow i ordered the sconnie burger i ordered medium well but not many places ever get it right this is one of those places the burger was decent the cheese curds skewered on top was average i actually ate the rest of my wifes burger at home and liked it betterwed come back here again probably not a friday night our friends enjoyed their dishes jambalaya and the seafood saute well definitely try the rest of the menu|my family and i got up at the crack of dawn on a sunday to beat the brunch crowd at cafe hollander we arrived right after opening and were one of only a few people in the restaurant i love the ambiance of the whole place  bikes in the air posters on the wall and lots of fun details all over the restaurant we sat in the section that looked like a german bar  not that ive ever actually been to a german bar but i assume it might look like this   i was happy to have a booth because my kids are more contained  i would love however in the summer to visit the section that appears to have large windows and walls that will create a cool openair dining spacei ordered the berry basil french toast i love ordering french toast for brunch because the stuff i make at home is just never quite right this french toast was just right it was delicious bread perfectly cooked with fresh berries basil and mascarpone i could have handled a little more mascarpone  it was basically a little bit of melted cheese on the top which added some additional flavor and texture but not much i admit i have eaten this exact same meal at the cafe hollander in tosa village and it was good both places next time i vow to try something newmy three kids each ordered one of the kids breakfast meals  waffles pancakes and french toast  the kids meals come on a rather large platter with the main course and a couple of sides like fruit and veggies i have to be honest  while totally affordable at  a plate my kids would have much rather had twice the amount of their actual breakfast than the extras  next time i will most likely order an adult portion of waffles pancakes or french toast and split it between them i appreciate cafe hollander trying to give my kids a well rounded meal but they really just wanted the main coursemy husband got the americana breakfast which is basically a variation of the same exact thing he gets everywhere and every time we go out for breakfast he really enjoyed it and said it was one of the better breakfasts hes had  which is saying a lot for a guy who eats eggs toast and meat every single time   i tried the breakfast potatoes that came with his meal and i personally wasnt a fan of the seasoning but he liked it overall i think cafe hollander is a great addition to the madison area its a beautiful space with good food and good service we will be back|i work in one of the local towers and find it very convenient to callin my order then just pick it up  food isnt inexpensive but usually very goodive tried several items from their menu  i especially liked the cuban sandwich  their philly was also really good it had a sweet kick to it|i have eaten here twice much better than cheeseburger in paradise ordering food is easy and simplistic it comes out hot and fresh they offer a condiment bar to put the typical veggies on i would eat here again|i will start with  stars but will probably be  stars after the next visit if is as good as our first visit was its new and as you would expect everything is fresh and crisp lay out is similar to most sports lounges plenty of tvs to watch your favorite team play  outside s seating is coming soon bring your family not just for the sport lounge crowd i got their hot wings i am usually disappointed as the hot wings are not as hot as i wish not so here their hot wings are hot just like i wanted them the plusthere is some extra sauce in the bottom i like that my wife got a veggie pizza she said it was very good plenty of cheese and the crust or pizza dough was especially good plenty more on the menu everyone should be able to find something they like the service was great the manager came out and greater us tell us what they were planning and invited us back great personal touch we will most certainly be back soon their challenge will be there are is several pizza places in the area getting in and out is easy but they are hard to seeforgot to saywelcome to the neighborhood|still grate food the new place is awesome i love it the service is a little rushed but they are so busy the food is the same as the old place witch i normally get the chimi witch is one of the best i think today i had the shrimp enchiladas they were ok to much sauce for but tasted good but a place to try if your in the area|the food was most excellent my first time here with some friends on a birthday we got sat in a corner five of us waitress took our orders and we got served our drinks and didnt come back until we got served our food i actually had to get up and go find an employee to get us more water i think we got full on ice chips and salsa by the time we got our food but its all good we got full all over again we didnt see our server again until we got our checks next time im gonna ask we sit in the middle of the restaurantagain food was excellent the service could use some improving pay attention its not a very big place|my brother and i went here after seeing the mixed review first the greeting there was a little bit of awkwardness when we first got there but someone came up after a couple minutes we were able to seat ourselves the waiter came along promptly and gave us menus he was super nice and personable we ordered and got our food all within  min the food was good not great the chicken was my favorite the filet was flavorless but it was cooked perfectly the garlic sauce on the side was so good the portion was smaller than anticipated again nothing was wonderful  but it was good the true magic of the establishment was the music videos hypnotizing the videos were so fun one looked like a trailer for a video gamewould i go back maybe the chicken was really good i wouldnt get the filet again the waiter was wonderful the food was decent the ambiance was fun due to the music videos maybe give it a go|have been here a few times and i love the fresh drinkstea options i also love several soups and so far my favorite salad is the cherry balsamic and the pesto chicken panini and cuban panini are great now the one gripe i have is the ordering process after placing my order for a family of five at the beginning i then have to remember everything i ordered and repeat to the people at the end of the line who gather all the food to place on trays very irritating especially when having a large order to repeat they need to come up with a better system|this is probably one of the best schezuan restaurants in las vegas or america  im unfortunately not able to share what its like in the motherland one can only wishwonton in chili oil  stars i love spicy food and usually order this because of the combination of wontons with a tad of spice this is the least spiciest version ive had however dare i say that this was one of the best wontons i have ever had the meat filling is legit its packed  and has amazing flavors i was able to taste the marinade inside the filling and it was juicy too the wonton skin was also perfectly cookednot too soggy boiled fish with green pepper sauce  stars i guess its jonathan gold approved but mr gold and i dont always agree ahem lotus of siam so i was just chillin wondering if wed be on the same page this time i have grown to love the spicy dishes with peppercorn but usually have ordered it in the reddish sauce at other restaurants this broth is so clear and delicious looking but it turns out i saw the article in time and the broth is not meant to be eaten the fish was cooked perfectly but i personally prefer this dish with other types of meats and also in the red saucestew it also isnt too spicy imho until you eat a peppercorn then good luck you better make sure that water is on its way chicken in garlic sauce  stars my first best and most fave version was in paris yeah so strange but this dish is the closest to the one i had the chicken is cooked perfectly and the flavor was on point the best in vegas so far fyi its a cold dish toothpick cumin lamb  starsmy favorite dish of the night the lamb chunks are nice sized meats it was cooked to perfection and the flavor is amazing i highly recommend it price is competitive with other schezuan restaurants service was on point and i will definitely be back to try more i saw an earlier review on cash onlythey take cc fyi|mvpita is a new restaurant that just opened in november mvp was affordable i got a two item chicken shawarma and shish kabob plate and my wife got a falafel pita pocket all for around  mine came with salad and mvp french fries  defiantly worth a visit if your craving a healthy meal packed full of flavor  the french fries and the steak shish kabob were the clear standouts for me  my wife said the falafel pita was not bad but nothing special  the steak kabob was good enough for me to want to come back|atmosphere food cocktails mocktails service pleasantly surprised  by the nice ambiance lots of windows and hanging lights of the place service was excellent aside from the very end when we had to ask for the check after a long waitdrinks both our guys ordered the old fashioned it was good but not great station does it bettermocktails us girls tried one of each the rb and the not in kansas anymore i like the rb slightly better however both were very sour neither of us finished the drinkappetizers we very much enjoyed the cheese board  which easily satisfied the  of us sharing it wish there was slightly more breadcrackers tho we also loved the corn break which comes with a flavored butter however the cornbread at porch is better if not cheaperveggie perspective food is generally veggie friendly with at least two sandwiches and two mains that were veggievegan friendly i incredibly enjoyed the seitan hoagie which was huge i took the other half home with tasty good quality seitan sausage and spread on a generous and buttered bun if you get a side ask for the house salad it is divine delicious endivefrisee with the most amazing light dressing beets and cheese my favorite part of the meal my husband enjoyed the steak  however said the meat could have been a better cut for the price it was perfectly cooked to what he asked fordessert we had the vegan apple crisp which is diced apples with granuolacrumble on top not great probably wouldnt order againpeople complain about the price it is pricey for what it is which i would say a fancier version of porch splitting the check for  people who had a drink each  appetizers an entree each and  dessert it was more than  a person without tip staff were very attentive during the majority of our meal and were lovely enough to realize it was my husbands birthday and dessert came out with a candle on top we absolutely appreciated that detail however we ended up waiting around for  minutes after dessert and having to flag someone down to get the waitress to split our check will probably return again for a date night but this probably wont be  a favorite hang out|i obviously found this place through yelp because i searched for new places around i had to look around but if youre familiar with the area around craig you prolly be able to easily find it i was greeted by a man and a kid at the counter so i would assume that this is family owned and told me that theyve only been open for  months now i myself have tried a lot of halal food especially in new york today i ordered the lamb chops combo for to go rice  lamb chops half a tomato yogurt salad and  pita bread for   tax  tip total of  i wasnt really impressed as the meat was dry over cooked on the grill i guess and it was bland it didnt come with any white sauce in it and the yogurt salad was just ok the pita bread didnt come with hummus and you would have to add  if you want one which i think was not a good idea pita bread comes with hummus and hummus comes with pita bread overall this combo is very expensive for the area that theyre catering for in comparison a lamb chop combo in nyc would only cost you  and the same box would give you overflowing rice and salad  lamb chops and falafel they still have a lot of room for improvement my suggestion is to lower the price or increase the amount of  serving also get a guy who really knows how to cook mediterranean food my lamb chop as well as the meat on the grillers were dry and bland |cms had a christmas gathering here the food was good and waitstaff attentive im going back to try other dishes|i decided to update my review of char after our initial visit ended up being a rough one back when they first opened in november  fortunately it looks like theyve gotten a lot of their issues worked out and things are running much more smoothly  once again we opted for three bruschettas  the apple mascarpone and fig spread is probably the best of their samplings  theyre okay but they come off more like cold crostini than they do bruschetta  since theyre all premade theyre all cold which should not be the case with wellmade bruschetta  im sure its easier to prepare them this way but i feel that their quality suffersas for the pizza which we actually got to eat hot this time ended up being a nice surprise  the crust is comparable to some of the more popular napoletanastyled places in downtown phoenix which actually says something  while most people like modifying their pies to the point of ruining them we prefer sticking with their specialty pizzas  their margherita is very well done while their farmers market unfortunately has way too many toppings to the point where its a total hodgepodge of ingredients  i would not order it againi really like that theyve adapted their ordering system to make things easier  while our first visit was absolute chaos their use of the number system that enables you to orderpay for your food and then wait for them to bring it out makes the experience run much more smoothly  we even had multiple people come check on us something that did not happen during our initial visit  well definitely be back in the future as theres a handful of other pizzas that are worth trying outi see it as a good little neighborhood place that will most likely become a favorite of people who live in the area|i was waiting for the opening of this place this is their second location and i am happy it is so close to home this is the first time ive tried tortilla fish and now i am hooked  our order included battered fish tacos a barbacoa beef taco shrimp quesadilla steak quesadilla rice and beans everything comes undressed so you can wild out at the salsa bar everything you could ever want on your taco or quesadilla the fish by itself is melt in your mouth the shrimp tastes fresh and not like salad shrimps the barbacoa is tender and juicy like a pot roast only thing is the tables are tight if the place is busy which it was and i assume it will always be they do have patio seating so thats a plus|came here before seeing star wars with my friends to grab some dinneri remember this location back since it was ruby tuesdays years ago and seeing how they changed the ambiance in the place and had really made it look good was my first thoughtfor food i had the nightly special of coconut curry soup that was really tasty and was recommended by my friend who got a cup before i got there i followed that by getting the salmon salad but i swapped the ahi tuna from the ahi salad the ahi salad had a bunch of fruits in it and i am one of the people who likes my fruit separate from my other foods the salad was really good and the crust on the ahi was great the fish itself wasnt the freshest but it wasnt bad either just dont be expecting high end sushi qualitythe service was great and our waitress did a great job handling splitting checks for the group and getting things out quickthe only negative i have is that the prices are a bit on the high end for the type of food but being on mill it is to be expectedi am probably going to add them in as a regular in the rotation of premovie dinner spots in the area going with  star for now as its good but middle of the pack as far as options go but really should be a |food was cold and bland service is supremely slow had to ask for our water three times before we got our first one way too expensive for what we got|great start very solid beers good tap list too|the service was great kitchen very slow took almost  to get food the manager and waitress took amazing care of us have patience worth it|im a little late to the review party on this one but better late than never this event was the very first time i ever visited spoon and now im dying to return things admittedly started a little slowly at this one with the yelp group seated in the main area we were moved to the private section later but until then there were a number of people sharing appetizers in a relatively small space around two tablesthat said the appetizers we tasted were absolutely wonderful the cheese plate we started with was quite nice and the the avocado salad bites  as well as the the meatballs with pita  were delicious but the real show stealers in my mind were the ahi tuna bites on crispy wontons so good i ate those tuna bites every single time they came to our tables throughout the night i literally have no idea how many of them i ate but it was a lotas others have mentioned we also sampled a gin  tonic with cranberries and a gin martini i was a big fan of the gin  tonic  i made that bad boy last  i also ordered a shandy cocktail just to try something not on the menu and to support spoon it was ok but next time its gin  tonics all the way for meall in all this was a great event spoons staff were so patient and were so happy to talk and answer questions throughout the night i was admittedly super happy when we were moved to the back room with multiple tables since we were all bumping into each other at first in our excitement and attempts to grab food and drink but overall this was a wonderful event  and if i have to spend an evening bumping into people id rather it be people on the wonderful elite team thanks so much for putting together another great event rachel|disinterested service at best despite a small lunch crowd felt like we were passed off between various servers who didnt really want to make the effortsalad was good and the sausages of the day were quite good mussels smelled great but we didnt have room to try everything we were  on our beer choices not their fault but it would be nice if they did halfpints so you could sample more taps|this is a really great local spot owned and ran by locals great outdoor space with corn hole fire pits kids area and even beach volleyball the food is really good and art the chef is great the service was really good and i will definitely being going back i ordered three different tacos steak chicken and fish the steak was my favorite art even brought me out a tasting of his marinade fantastic there are  salsas i liked the chipotle and tomatillo the chips have a  spice seasoning and are delicious i ate two bowls worth check it out|the nutcracker is a classic in any city and yelp giving away free tickets was pretty coolas someone who has had the luxury of seeing some great ballet the nutcracker in pittsburgh doesnt really do my artistic soul any justice  i will say that marie and the nutcracker on this night were quite good  however the lack of a live orchestra is truly wrong on so many levels  if you are someone with a strong classical music background you will need to just view this production as a spectacle  this isnt new york chicago or boston for sureonce you sit back and just take this as a free evening to get into the christmas spirit this is a fun way to get ready for the holidays the children dancers are really cute and it is fun to see the little kids dress up to go to the show  we also had pretty good seats for the ballet the left center of the orchestra  rows from the back gave us a view of most of the stageall in all i wouldnt pay much to see this production but it is an enjoyable evening out|after my friend posted on his social media that he went here  said it was better than tofu hut my boyfriend and i had to try it for starters lunch is  dinner i is  and dinner ii is i really liked the environment and the layout of the place the thing that i thought was really cool was the vent system there  its not your typical kbbq place where theres a huge hood thing on top of your grill the food was pretty decent we ended up really liking the marinated sliced rib eye but honestly i didnt think the price was worth it for the food at the end of our meal we were definitely full just not satisfied with how much we paid and the food if we had gone to gen we wouldve spent less money for more food and everything not sure if id want to come back but it was definitely a different experience|four stars for the most comfortable movie theater seats in town the decor is contemporary and upscalevery nicely done tickets are way too expensive though nice that it has a bar it lacks the charm of its original namesake feels more like an upscale multiplex rather than a cool art house theater i am all for change but i would have liked to have seen a little bit more character in honor of the historic theatre it replaced bottom line the super comfy seats  will bring me back every once in a while but it will no longer be my go to theater as it is just too expensive|if i had to pick my very favorite chain restaurant it would be pf changs  im aware that its not authentic but that doesnt mean its not deliciouswe stopped by after some shopping in the area on a snowy friday and were able to get a table pretty quickly  the hostess and server were both friendly  my husband enjoyed a glass of sake and i had a mai tai that turned out to be delicious  we split an order of lettuce wraps as an appetizer they dont custommake your sauce any more which is disappointing but they did happily provide us with chili paste and hot mustard to doctor it up ourselves  his changs spicy chicken extra spicy turned out great and provided the extra requested heat  my orange peel shrimp were as good as id remembered perhaps better because they have some fresh orange slices included as well  we also ordered a great wall of  chocolate  if you like  chocolate cake at all youll love this onepf changs consistently provides good chinese in a trendy but still casual atmosphere at a decent price and im always a fan|i love maxs but the food can be hit or miss sometimes the staples on their menu are always good and time tested favorites but beware that special menu there have been some epic duds on there that i wish i would have missed|the better option for pizza delivery in the north side do yourself a favor and dont ever go in for pickup|legends is that nice neighborhood restaurant that i probably forget about too often simple italian food at a good price its also byob which is a bonus|i frequently stay here while visiting in pittsburgh it is close to the convention center restaurants and bars the staff is friendly and always makes you feel welcome there is a cafe that serves breakfast and a modest dinner selection the rooms are comfortable and clean|decent pizza and hoagies tomato bisque soup is a good service reliable downtown joint with no complaints|i was in the mood for breakfast but it was the lunch hour  what better place to go than pamelas i had the the texmex omelette which came with potatoes and toast the food was good so was the service the restaurant isnt fancy but it is popular  good food at a great price one thing you should know its cash only|there are two entrances to this lot this is where we park when we come to the performing arts centerbelk theater to see a show only a one block walk away there are ticket tables once you get inside the theater where you can buy a parking ticket for  when you leave the lot either give the attendant both your tickets or if using the machine put your original one in first and then the one from the theater second with the yellow side down there was a bit of a log jam when everyone was leaving the lot but there were extra attendants on hand to direct traffic and take tickets in order to speed things up|we walked downtown and got dinner here i ordered enchiladas and while they tasted good i was disappointed by the size my girlfriend got some time of cajun pasta that tasted good and was much more appropriately sized|nutcracker reviewgreat performance not quite the same as seeing it every year growing up in nyc but pretty darn good amazing scenery i wanted to eat all the candy in the second act and quite a big cast of playersdancers they must have raided all the local dance schools for the cream of the crop so great to have something like this in charlotte belk theater was a perfect venue for them even though it was a very family oriented event it was still very classy and well done|its a small diner but it definitely wasnt cramped the menu had a pretty good selection of both breakfast and lunch items  i had the eggs benedict and they were delicious  the plate was covered in hollandaise saucethe staff was friendly my waitress made sure my water glass was always fullthe prices were reasonablethe one bad thing about my visit was that i ordered a milk and the waitress never brought it to me by the time i realized it i was already done eating so i didnt mention it they didnt charge me for it either|as a restaurant there is only one thing you should really order at murphys and that is the irish nachos waffle fries covered in cheese tomato olives jalapeo and sour cream its a heart attack waiting to happen so dont order it alone but it is still delicious especially with a beer or two or five|we came in after our last day of exams the night before we all went home for winter breakthis was my first time in murphys and ive got to say it was pretty sweet for a campus barits like an irishstyle pub lots of dark furniture and seating areas the inside is pretty big theres a few different rooms and even a downstairs that we didnt get a chance to check outwe shot a few games of pool and were able to have decent conversation due to the music being at an actually reasonable volume they had several drink specials i was able to get a harp for  and mcgillicudy shots were only  also ill have to come back when the guinness is on special if it ever isthe only thing i wasnt too happy about was the service it was quite slow it seemed like they were a little understaffed our bartender was good once he got around to us but perhaps the place was a little more crowded than usualeither way a good time and ill definitely be back|the burgers and fries here are actually very good less of a heart attack than joes and quite a bit more substantial than murphys i really like the bleu moon burger and the loaded fries are always a good idea|so this is my second review for this place i like this business it is close to me they have good deals on their higher end washesservices and it is hand wash the only thing that i have been noticing is the inconsistency of the actual work and washes each time i have two vehicles that i bring on a consistent basis sometimes i leave so satisfied and feeling good about the wash sometimes not so much not sure if there is a high turnover rate with them inexperience or if they just get lazy at times or maybe just overlooking some things this is the third time in the last couple months that they forget to add the scent and do a very poor job on the rims and air drying when i got back to work i already noticed water spots rims are still dirty very poor job and no smell at all in my car usually i am very picky with my pickup since it is black and you can see everything on it so i usually have them redo anything i am not satisfied with but it has happened several times now with my car that i end up feeling bad for paying for a complete works wash when i got an average wash at best my car is gray and not as noticeable so sometimes i do not notice until i get back home that the job was not very good again as of now i will keep coming back for the convenience and customer service very nice staff but please please keep an eye on the quality of the service i always see a guy that seems like he oks the service right before you pick it up maybe he needs to pay more attention to detail before they finish and return the vehicles its not good when the customer has to correct you and tell you how to do your job better its also not fun waiting an hour on average for your car to be done only to have to wait another  minutes after you ask them to redo things|let me ask you a few questionsdo you like alice cooperdo you like big dogs in your mouthdo you like rock and rolldo you like americawell then you came to the right place because yeah you bet your ass it has it alli got the big unit and it was bad ass they had a siren going off and me and my buddy were like wtf is going on

authentic mexican food my dad and i love meeting up here for some quality fatherdaughter time it has a divebar cozy feel which i love the service is always great and the food is always satisfying i am a creature of habit and always order the albondigas soup mexican meatball soup  rice inside and a small cheese crisp with green chilis and guacamole their housemade chips hot sauce and salsa are the bombcom i have been known to eat a whole bowl of chips and salsa to myself shh dont tell  if youre looking for a neighborhood favorite authentic mexican food joint this is your place|i was introduce to this place a few years ago by a friend of mine since then ive eaten there quite a few times and pizza is not the only thing they serve there pasta dishes are excellent too|i love going here for mexican food the food is always great and hot  service here is good too was there with the kids one evening and the server brought out a kids menu and crayons for them to draw with|excellent specials and great food  i had the steak with crab legs and it was cooked just how i ordered it  we had  people in our party so they gave us a private room which worked out swell  i recommend dining downstairs where there are comfy chairs and a fireplace  the brie and steak on crostini appetizer is to die for|this place used to be fantastic but since theyve changed ownership a few years ago its gone very downhill every waiter knew us by name and the old owner would always be friendly and accommodate our sometimes silly requests their dishes were so tasty and to me was the best italian place in the metro phoenix area but now im not sure my family can be a regular anymore too many changes on the menu for it to be the same place to those that want to give it a shot its not a very kid friendly place as its quite small on the interior make a reservation if possible the atmosphere is very intimate for a date night|i felt like i was actually in mexico when i was there the chips and salsa were great very fresh tasty and probably made there i had the smoked marlin tacos and my husband had the carne asada tacos both large portions and very good the margaritas could have used a little more tequila but not bad decent service fair prices|i love this restaurant  we have been there a couple times for take out  the lady working at the counter was super helpful on picking out dishes we would love  i would go back again for sure|really happy with todays breakfast ordered a mommas special not on the menu grits theyre delicious two eggs small hashbrown two pancakes and bacon and sausage also

devoured our meals before i remembered lol parking lot was packed but we didnt wait at all to be seated service was great everything was good shopped at the store afterwards and picked up a few things wish they had more sales kinda pricey adorable clothes for women and kids something for everyone my kinda place wish they would open one in california|much better than the one off cave creek road this location had plenty of bagels ready for sale somewhat crowded three employees and i was greeted right away monday they run a  bagel for  special|wings and pizza were both really good ordered take out at a really busy time during a football game and it was ready in  minutes and they were very polite id do it again|rude incompetent lazy staff sold me new weights that did not match would not switch them out when i came all the way back due their mistake not handled well not impressed|how is a store like this not open later than  less than a week before christmas what about the people who would like to come after workbig open sign on building little closed sign on window i guess i have to go through the hassle of parking and going inside a huge confusing mall to get my gifts|we have been coming to this location for years now and i must say that inside the store is clean and well organized there always seems to be enough staff on hand for our needsalso they were the first place in our area to carry the newest season of shopkins toys|nice little hidden gem  mostly kitchenwhere stores a few cute antique places discount clothing and a bookstore  they have a lot of s style quarter rides for little kids placed throughout and i give my daughter a handfull of quarters to spend when we go careful of the racehorse it shakes her to pieces and she loves it|this used to be one of my phoenix staples when i lived here  years ago or visited in recent years  after going today i dont know if this is going to be a must visit for me anymore at lunch you have the option for express lunch and order from the counter and serve yourself drinks or you can sit down and get the same deals  all the menu options  i hate taking a servers table so we elected for full service  it was busy but not crazy busy today for lunch  our server had a trainee but it seemed to take forever for everything  at the end he apologized for giving crappy service  he was very polite but just missed all the serving point  i had to get a refill on our iced teas on my own from the self service area  since we waited so long with empty cups i also had to bring my cold pizza back up to the counter they offered to recook it but i hate wasting food  they reheated it but they went a little aggressive and almost burned itthe lunch speacials are great since they give you a slice and multiple other options another slice  drink wings salads or garlic knots at a reasonable price  will i be back  ill give them another shot since i have really liked this place for years but i was really disappointed in todays experience|they have the best fast food pretzels and a good selection of flavors our favorites are the jalapeo pretzel and the cheddar stuffed pretzel bites sadly theyve changed the cheese dip over the years what used to be so good it was a must is now the cheap neon colored processed cheese its nasty kills a great pretzel and a waste of money|i only go for breakfast  always get the same thing because its soooo deliciousness i have never had anything like this or seen it anyplace else griddled bread pudding it a twist on french toast with griddled french pudding slices   maple syrup the syrup is what makes it though its not the super thick can barely pour out syrup its a lot more liquidly so it soaks into the toast perfectly  their bacon is super nummy it has a sugar maple taste to it that makes your mouth water while youre eating it i also get a single pancake  justbecause the pancakes are so delicious that i cant pass up eating just a little  i have brought home my left over slice of griddled french toast i wasnt sure how it would heat back up but it worked really well i warned it up a little in the microwave then finished it in a pan on the stove to keep it from getting soggy worked like a charm think i may need to go for breakfast in the morning|ya know this place is ok in a pinch if youre in the area and want a quick lunch as in in their buffett which is one of the only mexican food restaurants in the valley that still offers one  beef fajita meat has a good marinated flavor three stars because its not the best ive ever had far from the worst just somewhere in the middle definitely edibleim just a mexican food fanatic and certainly know the best places in the valley to go  this place doesnt make my top |i like the quality of the bagels but always check your order before walking out about  of my visits they mess up my order so if you are a to go person please check the bag i ordered a half dozen today and when i got home i found only five in my bag another visit they put the wrong cream cheese on my lunch bagel to go|came in for the endless soup and salad lunchno big surprises thereits soup and its saladbrandon at the bar did not offer to bring more of eitherfine enoughdidnt really needwant morecool enough bought me a beerfriendly and attentive service|i would give this between  stars because the property is lovely and decorated nicely for christmas lights everywhere high on the hillside the room is also nice and clean two full beds with a desksitting area small fridge and coffee pot with complimentary coffee tea and bottled water i got a great rate with the price match guarantee so it was worth it for the discount alone plus toiletries smelled amazing and rooms were very private and quietwhat i dont like they charge day for parking whether you self park or valet ugh i would have been pissed if they actually charged us but the check out bill did not include the parking fee because the property is open so i dont even know how they would know if we had a car parked there or not second thing the hallways are very heavily sprayed with deodorants and air fresheners so its does smell musty because they are enclosed but its almost so strong its sickening lastly no free wifi they charge between day for wifi ah no thanks we didnt eat at the property or utilize any amenities like the pool so i cant comment on those|came here for late lunch with my husband and son they served us pretty quick our servers were very nice and friendly the chef also came and greeted us and check to see if we were ok the food tasted ok not horrible at all for the price we paid will definitely go back|let your customers know to remove credit cards  anything with a swipe bar from pockets before mriit should be on the forms

experience but this was a huge buzz killwas there   pm|its no secret that pho is the best hangover food who doesnt crave it so when youre partying in las vegas its nice to be able to go a short distance for some pho on the strip theres the pho place in ti but its  and not that good this isnt too far from the strip so its pretty perfectly locatedi wouldnt say this is the best pho or anything like that but its pho and for about  a bowl sounds similar to prices at home in san francisco for me the place is clean and looks pretty modern in style lots of tables but there can be a wait during lunch time but we only waited about  minutes on a monday afternoon which isnt too bad by the way say the name pho kim long fast  see if you get what the name really is |the food was good but if you want to eat in a caferia this place is for you big bright gleaming lights just like a cafeteria or bingo hall   no atmosphere i sat down in the overly bright blinding booth and touched the booth seating with my arm and it was hollow and i fell through about one foot the waitress lauged and said she would take note of it   food  stars but atmosphere about  if i could give a negative i would|great pho place  i come here quite often when i am in las vegas  good portions at reasonable prices  service is hit or miss  sometimes we get a server who cant speak or understand english too well which leads to messed up orders  they are quick to fix it though| starspho so  is one of our two pho spots when we visit las vegas the restaurant is located in chinatown  not too far off the strip this particular pho restaurant is located inside a plaza with the asian supermarketpho tai nam gan sach  rare steak well done flank brisket tendon and tripe good amount of meat and soup inside my bowl broth wasnt as flavorful as it once used to beweekends are normally packed during peak times we were seated right away but it took a while for our food to come out|came for quick breakfast  food and service are moderately good  price is reasonable compared to main strip dinning  looks like family own business with farm house style decor  mainly local eating here so ambience is very casual and relax  small parking lot but sufficient parking spaces|their selection of gifts is great the women who work there are not as helpful as i would imagine a hallmark store to be usually when you are going in a gift store you are full of love and emotion and ready to find the perfect gift or cardfirst time i went in for a gift for my daughters teacher they showed me a wall of ornaments and said i think theres some teacher stuff on this wallpicked out a cute teacher ornament that was all scratched up and handed it to me and left me to hunt for more very short and cold and felt more like i was at a grocery store than a boutiquei went back the second time for a little childrens book and asked the ladies if they provide gift wrappingone girl said um well im not very good at itand looked at  other ladies and both of them awkwardly and silently stared at me the girl then said we have gift bagsi wasnt expecting them to just gift wrap my item because im crazy this is a hallmark store a gift store so its very strange that they dont provide this service not even for a charge and i guess what was worse was the awkward reaction from the employeeswell that being said i wont be returning  not wonderful experiences not my steeze|ive been a panera fan for many years its always pretty good there are plenty of selections  good bagels soups and sandwiches the staff are nice and helpful at this and all locationsim not sure what it is if my tastes have changed or the restaurant has but the food all of it just doesnt taste as good as i remember still sometimes you have a hankerin for a pastry soup or sandwiches so its a decent choice|brought a friend from out of town here to get pretzels where else are you going to get a good pretzel in the burg|joyces is the best homemadehandmadefreshso coollets support small business entrepreneurs  chech her outyou wont be disappointed |really good fish and chipsdecent serviceand some good beers on tap i also enjoyed the environment as well will definitely go here again next time im in pittsburgh|good place to go to grab a drink was pretty crowded with people having a good time getting ready for the steelers gameeven though it was busy here the service was really really good     the menu was just your regular pub food from burgers to appetizers i went with the chicken tacos they were ok not something i would recommend though beers on tap were mostly simple ones nothing to get excited about      overall this pub seems like it is an excellent place to go if your ready to start your partying|homey but very traditional sushi place that makes me feel i walked into a family restaurant in japanbyob the best sushi in pittsburgh but take that with a grain of salt  polite and lovely waitstaff usually dressed in traditional japanese robesi enjoyed their vegetarian sushi rolls as well as the fried tofu dinner i enjoy the edamame that comes with the dinner as a side dishmy husband always gets the sushi sampler dinner and says it tastes very fresh and is very fillingservice is efficient and wait is rarely very long we have been back here once since going  months ago look forward to coming again for my sushi fix good overall just not wowworthy|best greasy spoon diner breakfast in the north side the service is usually pretty awful but you go there to sit drink coffee eat breakfast and work off a hang over so whats the rush|cash only no delivery and the guy at the counter can be pretty surly pizza is pretty good though not good enough to deal with the previous mentioned items however|a really good place for breakfast and lunch but really limited hours  park in the big lot across the street instead of fighting with street parking|the theater had comfy seats and was small and not too crowded we didnt purchase any snacks or drinks ripoff as usual we could hear the movie next door some action movie every once in a while but it wasnt too bad|i went there around  pm the waiter was great and the food came out quickly and was good|decided to drop by instead of going to dorians  got twice the food for the same price   the food is fresh   service is friendly   its more of a to go place   no free refills|its a buffet and its  bucks  you can go either way here  really picky and eat okay or go for bust and pig out on all sorts of food  food is good and price is reasonable  waitress deserve tips they really have a lot of table messes to clean up after all the kids and families that eat here    dont be cheap  tip your wait staff |ill keep it simple this is an average bar im not too big on the atmosphere and the single bathroom can make for a long line but all you need to know is that their giant long island iced teas are to die for they are by far the best ive ever had ill be sure to stop back in for one many times in the future|wed heard great things about paisans and the pizza did not disappoint crispy thin crust which is always my favorite intense delicious red sauce full of herbs tomatoes bustling flavors ours was topped with sliced onions banana peppers sausage and pepperoni we went with the spicy cheese blend and it was velvety smooth and melded well with everything else it was truly delicious and we devoured every bite we also ordered the mozzarella sticks as an appetizer these did not compare well with the pizza the coating tasted burnt and yet the insides were slightly cold and not molten at all the marina sauce for dipping was delicious chunks of tomatoes and peppers loaded with oregano  very tastythe restaurant is much larger than you would expect while driving up it covers the majority of the ground floor there are myriad rooms lots of dark wood benches where we sat it definitely felt dark and enclosedthe service was fine they greeted us when we came in had us sit and the bar until a table was available picked us up from the bar and ushered us to our table took our order and delivered our food nothing wrong nothing extra just the minimum to get the job done wout doing anything wrongbesides the mozzarella sticks my only complaint was the prices it is very good pizza and you are paying for it we waited at the bar before being seated and noticed those same mozzarella sticks are half price there at more than  for stick id definitely prefer to sit in the bar area beers were also much more expensive than i expected but again i see they have a happy hour special which would have been much more reasonable for pizza and beer when we go again well definitely do that instead|delicious sandwiches lunch time there is a little wait but youd expect that from a great local sandwich shop i wish there was outside seating|people are really nice service is really slow  tons of people in the drive through happening place  an obvious friend of the staff is disrupting the smooth flow of the establishment  place is clean too  they did offer me a drink for the inconvenience of waiting so long so thats a big plus|simply one of the best places to get donuts have been coming here since i was a kid the best part is the donuts still taste the same all soft and fluffy just like a donut should be you wont be disappointed when you come here its a smaller place but worth the wait |we met with family at blue adobe recentlyi had the cruz kitchen plate chile relleno tenderloin and carne adovada and my wife had the carne adovadathe red chile on my cruz kitchen plate was delightfully spicy but not a challenge   the chile relleno was crisp on the outside but not soggy or overdone the tenderloin was wonderfulthe carne adovada was wonderfulmy wife enjoyed the prickly pear margarita with dinnerall in all a very solid restaurant to add to our new mexican cuisine rotation|dr izenberg is a full  stars doctor  how he runs his office and his staff is significantly less dr i  our family has been seeing dr izenberg since around   he is an excellent do  he listens to what you say and makes decisions based on what you say  he always prefers natural remedies and less detrimental treatments but he also knows they dont always work and never has a problem trying standard or new treatments staff his staff was always awesome until he moved over to university  then it dropped in quality and the wait times increased  it got so bad at one point that i changed doctors  i spent some time checking state boards licensing and ratings and selected one  internist with over  years experience he sucked and so  months later i selected another internist with over years experience  he was okay for a few years but still subpar and so i returned to izenberg  and long waiting times  velda rose when izenberg moved over to vr the staff was a nightmare at first but then things steadily improved  its now pretty decent but i still get annoyed periodically

cashiers are very friendlywould i frequent this cafe if i didnt work in the papago spectrum ummm probably not but they seem to do just fine with office worker flow during the day plus i really like asking my coworkers hey are you going to the bug today ha ha|convenient location with competitive prices for gas there are multiple stations so i havent really had any problems getting in and out in a

and i have dined at this location a number of times and we usually order the same thing each timecompanion orders the chicken sandwich jalapeno mac and cheese a brownie and a drinki usually order rib tips cole slaw and a drink we have never been disappointedcompanions chicken was moist and filled the entire bun the mac and cheese had perfectly cooked al dente noodles with loads of cheese on them the brownie was moist and perfectly chewy and chocolateyi order my rib tips without sauce as i prefer to taste the meat with just a little sauce in the background and they always perfectly oblige my wishes their cole slaw is hard to beat creamy and crunchy with excellent flavorstaff is always friendly and most helpful they take all credit cards including  amexat the risk of sounding prejudiced this is my go to place for bbq and i do eat there fairly regularly it is clean and relatively quiet at holiday time you can have them smoke your turkey for you at a very reasonable price my only wish is that they would have smoked lamb i once had a sandwich of it and thought i went to heaven but that was some time ago stars for cleanliness good food nice sized portions and wonderful customer service|we took a break from the christmas shopping craziness and had dinner at rio mirage tonight the food was delicious chips and salsa are complimentarythe chips were a little oily like they had been refried to reheat but the salsa is sooo goodhub had a fried burrito chimichanga enchilada style the steak inside was super tender and flavorful as usual i ordered more than i could eati ordered albondigas meatball soup mainly because i have made it but never eaten a restaurant version and i was cold it was great and would have filled me up all on its own savory meatballs carrots celery onions potatoes cabbage i think and rice floating in a thick chili broth comfort food for main course i had mahi mahi tacos with double beans since i dont like  rice much cubes of well seasoned fish grilled and served in soft fried corn tortillas soft but not dry with lots of perfectly ripe avacado chunks with a jicima pineapple salsa on the side i prefer a cabbage slaw with fish tacos but it was good the beans were black beans which i love evenly cooked and topped with cheese lusciousmy margarita was made from a mix but hey this is a low priced neighborhood restaurant they did get the lightly salted rim part spoton no room for dessertall of the service was great from greeting to drinks to packing up my leftoverserik is an awesome waiter give that man a raise|tried today for the first timebeen meaning to for a long timeill get straight to it i tried the chili cheese dogs and they were just oki actually liked the dogshad good flavor and a bit of snap the chili was similar to weinerschnitzel which i like the bun was okoveralla decent dog  not heaven but not hell either|for the price and location the rooms are okay a bit outdated the toilet was hard to flush and the air conditioner barely worked although it was quite spacious from my room on the th floor  you could hear the traffic from the highway and music from the club downstairs there isnt much to eat here  no room service and the cafe is pretty slow  front desk was nice as was the valet|it was very informative interesting and beautiful but we did the night tour and most of the lights that illuminate the signs were broken we were walking around in the dark with the flashlight of the tour guide please fix the lights i cant take pictures of the signs and its hard to hobble around in the dark shining a small flashlight on the signs does not help very much also the tour could be more succinct and less scripted the tour guide was very knowledgable but it dragged and it was monotonous if youre interested in las vegas history its good but you need to fix some aspects of the tour to make it more professional|my review is mainly based on what i went to the casino for holiday laser show arcade  ice creamthe holiday show was excellent and obviously kid friendly my daughter loved it i would recommend being there at least  before the show starts in order to get a good view the arcade was small but there were some good games and the girl that was working was very friendly i give her  stars we had ice cream at clementine janes which was reasonably priced the only reason i took one star off was due to the ventilation the smoke smell was hard to get used to granted its a casino but still it was overwhelming|good authentic mexican food huge servings and good flavor my only issue was the service our server was not very friendly and honestly seemed impatient with us when we placed our order the hostess was nice when we walked in but just the server was not nice i enjoyed my posole and enchilada oh and the free chips and salsa were very good too they also give you free bean dip we did get a free picture with our meal the girl was trying to sell us photos but when we opted out she gave us our free picture and also seemed annoyed oh well for the food in itself i would probably go back but wish the service was better|i had visited thai spice once about  years ago and really enjoyed the foodfor whatever reason we hadnt been back until saturday afternoon  thai spice is a large restaurant that is open and very clean  service is very polite and very quick we orderedpork egg rollsshrimp and chicken pad thaithai spice beef  the pork egg rolls were very good  they were not greasy  they were crisp and flavorful and the deep fried egg roll wrapper had almost a tempura flavor very light and delicious  the duck sauce that was served with them was good as well shrimp and chicken pad thaii always have to order pad thai at a new spotits usually a really good way to judge the rest of the dishes  this was almost perfect  flavorful just the right amount of spice and the noodles were cooked perfectly   the only issue  only  shrimp  when i order something called shrimp and chicken i want there to be more than  pieces of shrimp  since my husband and i split the entrees we each only got one  thai spice beef lean strips of beef marinated in royal thai sauce sauteed and served on top of rice crispy noodlesthis is thai spices signature dish and it is delicious  the meat is tender  the rice noodles are crisp and crunchy giving a pleasant texture and the sauceyum  thats about all i can say without drooling  the thai iced coffees are good too and a large to go coffee is enormous  thai spice well done  i cant wait to come out again to try more items|classy italian restaurant thatll knock your socks off    went on sunday  at  with my yelpy friend jamie p  she was nice enough to make us reservations and the place was packed so im glad she did that we had  adults and a baby in our party and the hostess threw a hissy fit because she said the reservation is for fournot five peopleso well have to wait  i was thinking cant we just pull up a high chair to the table  the answer was no  ended up being seated about pm and no food on the table until about  but thats the only puny little complaint that i have   got us a small  staggioni pizza a margarita a whiskey sidecar cocktail an appetizer of clams a house salad a chocolate cake two coffees and a ginger ale  the table and napkins are real white linen and the table is covered by white paper  crayola crayons were brought out for my boy which i thought was cool none of that cheapo rose art shit  i originally wanted the branzino but they were out  sad violin noises the clams were hot and fresh and the menu says it comes with  but i swear there were at least  dozen in my bowl  the menu says   manila clams evo lemon parsly and im pretty sure thats not how you spell parsley and shouldnt it be evoo if they are trying to say extra virgin olive oil  whatevsit was  and the clams were hot and sweet and wonderful  i only had one that was sandy but the rest were awesome  the  staggioni pizza had pizza sauce sausage pepperoni bell peppers onions mozzarella and olives  the small was  and worth every penny  i loved the puffy crust and im enjoying the leftovers today as we speak  the chocolate cake must be ordered ahead of time at the time you order your entrees and was a steal for   it is a rich soft centered valrohna chocolate cake adorned by a vanilla sauce and pistachios  valrohna is a type of rich chocolate heavy on the cocoa side  i absolutely loved this  its making my mouth water right now just thinking about it with olive garden being the only other italian food ive experienced this place blows it out of the water  it would be a great place to take a date or family members that come here from out of town  i liked it a lot  and i liked the good company even more wink wink|really do love this dry cleaners no matter how far i am away i will come here i get my comforters cleaned amazingly here the set up is just really quick ofcourse i cant forget about thos low rates highly reccommend|it was our first time on brenden theatres and the whole family enjoyed it we bought the  movie monday ticket online what a deal i must say the seats werent comfortable though but other than that it was worth it|polo towers is part of diamond resorts international and this is a timeshare facility  anyone coming here needs to know this up front  weve been members at polo since   the wife and mother inlaw are gamblers so i figured wed be headed to las vegas every year so why no a permanent residence  to me polo is on par with most of the hotels on the las vegas strip for the price  the rooms are well maintained the beds are fantastic and i love the hot hot high pressure showers  the only thing missing with polo towers are the inhouse restaurants and gambling machines one might find in the big hotels  however polo towers is situated in the las vegas strip and is once block from six major casinos  everything you need is within a minute walk  i will admit the pressure of timeshare selling is a pain in the behind  but as owners you have to know what your limits are what your needs are and stick to that  if stated up front your wishes will be respected  but  you can still expect the sells pitch|benihana is fun to go to for group events my tastes have changed over the years and plenty of restaurants are better but this is one of my mums alltime favorites so we went for her birthdaymost of the staff are helpful but indifferent is it cultural i love that theyve turned teppanyaki into a fun show but our cook wasnt really into it no worries because the food is still goodyou start with some soup that used to contain more mushrooms and onions the broth is still good though next onto the same salad theyve served forever iceberg lettuce meh with a tasty ginger dressingnext onto your appetizer zucchini onions shrimp  all good as are the dipping sauces then onto your main course my favorite is the chateaubriand you also get some tasty mushrooms cant eat it all makes for damn good leftoversyou end with some ice cream and are stuffed to the brimgood fun choice for a group event|everything was delicious and the service was great  it was very empty not sure what that was about|good choice to grab something quick and affordable came here starving from walking around the strip guacamole was freshly prepared for us from haas avocados ordered enchiladas pork shredded beef and chicken would recommend chicken while pork would rank lastoverall good food very good service and great prices|it was okay not many items on the menu they werent fresh either may be because we went little late for lunch buffet the food was dried up|we ordered food by phone said it would be ready in min we got there paid and still took mins turns out our food had been ready but the lazy cashier charged us and didnt give us our food|my first time in was for the free oil change on veterans day  the wait area is comfortable with coffee stand bottled water and tv  plenty of parking long wait can head across the street for lunchstaff was friendly  no real complaints although one can argue there is nothing to complain about with a free oil change|i cant give border grill a better than  star review because it is the little things that matter just as much as the big thingswe went on a livingsocial deal that for  for two we got guacamole an appetizer to share   entrees a dessert and  drinks  good deal right  the service was good and attentive in fact very good  the margaritas that came with the meal were small and we finished them quickly  not bad but nothing special  the chips and salsa were tasty but nothing much beyond what is found in every mexican restaurant in town  we had the ahi tuna appetizer and while there were spicy tastes the tuna itself seemed to get lost and had no recognizable tasteour entrees were good sized i had the tecate carnitas and she had the sauteed scallops and shrimp  both were good and certainly a cut above your average mexican place  the flour tortilla that came with my dish was really tasty  the carnitas were not as tasty and seemed a little blandi complained when we first sat down that it was cold  nothing changed  towards the end of our meal a manager came by to inquire about our satisfaction and i mentioned that sitting and being cold took away from my enjoyment of the meal  he did apologize with some story of doing some remodeling that the hotel controls the heat and that the room they put us in was more of an overflow room with lots of glass and doors  regardless i was cold and a place that has no control of the temp should renegotiate their lease  i feel that border grill is responsible for my comfort not mandalay bay hotel  why put people in this room when you know it is cold  that night it dropped into the s  i would have trouble hearing any excuse other than offering to move our table which was never offeredif i would have paid full price i would have left unhappier  while nice it was not superior and while the servers all did a great job there were enough little things that were only palatable because of the deal|beef kabob was tender and flavorful also enjoyed the falafel and rice the pitas were from a package but overall meal good|had a coupon for buy one get one apps and bryan was an amazing bartender and server  the food was cooked perfect it was am and still amazing  thanks bryan for a great night  ill be back asap|at one time this was my favorite it really started a slide about  months ago the food and service was always st class now the food is hit and miss the service is not professional as it used to be javier the owner used to be on top of things really sad|this place is one of the better ayce in vegasits always super busy especially at night so make a reservationthe service is always pretty solid i cant really think of any complaints therethe apps are super good seaweed salad poke gyoza everything super fresh and tasty miso soup is pretty solid the mussels are amazing not too much globby cheese and sauce the poke is also very fresh and not overloaded with onions like some other places do the cajun albacore here is still my favorite the perfect amount of spice nigiri cuts are always pretty thick the ecstacy roll and the lemon roll are my favorites they do half rolls here too which is awesome i love that you can also get more than one mango mochi for the all you can eat a lot of places dont do that and im obsessed with mango mochi|pretty average taco shop a little watered down in some locations to fit the taste of the gringos  in fairness though their market here is a little different than the market in california  even in vegas some of the robertos are just a little different in depth of flavorthey have somethings that on the menu in san diego hazard center store that they do not have here and i wish they did  for example the hash brown burrito and this amazing loaded carne asada quesadillawith that said still a fairly consistent solid choice|second time here  ordered the meal for two food was delicious but portions small dessert was included in this special but portion limited for two individuals very slow service|pretty cool museum  seven floors of works and artifacts from warhols life i attended a gallery tour by one of the museum guides which i found pretty informative and relaxed you start from the seventh floor and work your way down it was a shame that you couldnt take photos here i feel like they would get so much more free press and popularity if they let their visitors instagram some of the pretty neat exhibits each floor focuses on a different era of warhols careerlife you end at this dope gift shop where i could easily spend a couple hundred bucks because they sell some really neat booksprintstrinkets|french toast is amazing definitely worth the wait in line however ive had the same waiter the last two times who was less than inviting he spoke so loud and uninterested it felt like he was yelling at us despite the relatively poor service he didnt even come back to check on us its still the best breakfast ever i keep going back for more|friend and i came here for  brunch on a mondayand the line went out the door it is so popular and you cant make reservations in the morning but the food was worth the wait i had the lobster and shrimp eggs benedict and my friend and i split a short stack of the apples and cream pancakes the eggs benedict was amazing  the texture and flavors worked so well together also dipping the amazing bread into the sauce and egg yolks is definitely the move pancakes were out of this world too only thing is that the place is really hectic  not very organized which probably contributes to the long lines also its cash only no fear theres an atm right next door finally its like super greasy in there like they need better air ventilation or something the fact that they have an open kitchen means that i left feeling like there was oil on my hair face and clothing which is kind of gross|stopped by here for lunch one day and had the kaya burger with a side of sweet potato fries the burger was gigantic i couldnt physically eat it with my hands rather i had to dissect it with my fork and knife and it came with a fried egg avocado their kaya special sauce chihuahua cheese tomato bacon and pickles i ordered my burger medium rare and i found it cooked a little too much for my tastes the burger was alright  not mindblowing but pretty decent the fries were a disappointment i had read such rave reviews about the sweet potato fries but i found them a bit stale dry and bland ambience of the place was very nice  eclectic blend of modern furniture and artwork service was very mediocre|such a cute cafe this is the kind of place i wouldnt mind coming to one morning with a book sitting down with a cup of coffee and reading for hours while drinking my way through a couple more cups and a muffin or pastry just wish it was closer to campus|love this place so yummy not a lot of space for large groups but its a cute cafe to grab a bite or a yummy drink ive been here twice first time was while i was waiting for a train back to chicago second time was a quick brunch with some friends food was great both times their aroma salad is so yummy  usually not a fan of those kind of salads im in the basic kind not fancy with nuts etc but i enjoyed it a lot their mugs you get if youre drinking there are huge probably a better deal than a togo cup but not sure what the actual measure is either way if im ever in the area again ill probably stop here over any of the other cafes|of the area sushi places this would be second to stingray  we did not sit at the teppanyaki tables so i cant comment on that  happy hour menu is good with nice menu and drink choices  overall i would return  you should give it a try and see what you think|great tasting food and service but they must use preservatives or msg because everyone in our party of  had an upset stomach afterwards even though we all ordered something different  next time i will ask about preservatives in the food|their service is quick and easy they have a multitude of tea options and their pad thai is a huge serving i can never eat it all in one sitting|the sandwiches are legen wait for it dary all you have to do is ask a local and they will tell this is like a diner in new jersey no frills no bs just darn good food with iron city beer or ic lights dont go in here thinking its all about the service or linen tablecloths its sandwiches and local beer in the og strip district if you want a real treat go when the bars close and stumble into this bad boy just dont forget what you want to order because you will get stoned caned or water boarded love it|we stopped in for lunch midweek in middecember i dont know much about irish food but thought it might be fun to try a couple of irish brews the decor was interesting plush seats on one side of a table and wooden chairs on the other side or wooden benches on one side of a table and plush chairs on the other everything seemed a little dark and heavy with lots of redsour waitress was attentive and quick i ordered a couple of beers from the beer list unfortunately they were out of both of them our waitress recommended a substitution it was fine but not irishfor lunch i tried the poutine it came with thick cut fries cheese curds and shepherds pie filling the fries were asdescribed  very thick cut there were a lot of them and definitely tasted of potato they really could have used more salt pepper or the shepherds pie filling to give them some flavor the cheese curds were a little jarring i expected them to be warm and molten but they were cold bites surrounded by lots of potatoes the shepherds pie filling was delicious chunks of tasty root vegetables and a thick warm sauce i really wish there had been more of this to truly cover all of those thickcut friesim not going to rush back but id give it another try and definitely order something different maybe the regular shepards pie|i dont know if the concession stand has gotten any better but amc yas certainly upped their game to compete with the other theaters theyve updated the seats into the nice reclining leather ones and have added a bar they also handled the opening night of star wars amazingly im definitely more likely to come back here now|favorite mall in arizona wide variety of stores with great department store options great for fashion decorating and dining dillards has the best deals of any store at the mall very big and clean that is well organized for hitting different types of shopping|such a fun show a good mix of silly hilarious antics with really amazing acrobatics beware if you dont want to get involved in the show dont sit in the section near the stage they pulled a lot of people out of the audience to participate in the show i loved the small theater it seems like all of the seats had a good view and the performances were just incredible we honestly spent an hour after the show trying to decide which part was the most impressive|oh spearmint rhino you are an odd one i would comment on the dancers beauty here but the place was so dark it was hard enough to see my group and we were sitting next to each other i guess the closer to the stage you are the better youll be with seeing performers the service was alright girls were hustling and prices are overrated if i had to make suggestions the first would be to lighten the place up enough to see whos in front of me also some drink specials would probably encourage more spending from patrons and lastly i understand the nature of the trade in this establishment but girls you dont have to toss out lines that are easily identifiable as routine speeches i was over this place as soon as i walked in but hey its vegas and why not overall i had a fun time but if i had a choice to come back to spearmint rhino or venture to a different strip club in the future id opt for the latter|i stayed here with a group of  girls we got a one bedroom suite that came with a king bed and a lshaped couch we all had a place to sleep that wasnt the floor despite having quite a few of us it was comfortable here the price for the room was pretty cheap too in comparison to some other hotels on the strip it had  bathrooms with one shower only plenty of sink space however the lighting wasnt too bright it was dimish so photo ops werent great i didnt mind staying here but i was disappointed in the fridge it didnt work we even called the engineer twice within our twoday stay in addition the ice machine outside our door had no ice either what bad luck but overall i would probably stay here again for the price but its not my favorite hotel in vegas|we were seated right away upon arrival  we sat inside but near the windows so the view was wonderful  service was extremely nice especially by our server  she recommended the braised beef dish and it was fantastic  very tender and flavorful   also order steak dish which was good too  at the end of the meal i got a macchiato coffee and it was strong and good  perfect energy booster i needed and save me from craving fatty dessert  definitely recommend this place|it is my tradition to end every vegas trip with brunch at mon ami gabi  this restaurant provides for a classy ambiance and and unbeatable view of the strip and the belliago water fountains if you can get a table in the front area  their fresh baguettes are also quite a treat and my last visit was no exception  it is also my tradition to order the prime steak sandwich   for a sandwich is not cheap but it was always justified here  until this past visit  i will say i was quite disappointed  they were not the juicy medium rare fresh off the grill steak strips i got in the past  it tasted like a warm beef sandwich you could order at any hot deli  certainly not  worth and not what i expect from mon ami gabi  on the other hand my wife got the warm chicken and brie sandwich was was surprisingly tasty  the spread was just off the hook  an entirely disappointing experience was luckily spared by my wife selflessly trading half her sandwich for mine  i may still keep my mon ami gabi tradition but try something different on the menu next time|my friends and i were very excited to try this place and surprises that on opentable we were able to make a lunch reservation the day of we ordered the soup of the day cream of potato and onion soup to start off with i loved the cream of potato soup if you want something creamy and savory i definitely recommend it i also enjoyed the onion soup but i was not a huge fan of the baked cheese on top i ordered the eggs benedict which came with canadian bacon and a side of hash browns i found the hash brown to be really cold when it came out and the english muffin was extremely hard i couldnt cut it so i just ended up eating the top part it was just too burnt my friends orders were delicious though especially the chicken sandwich i will definitely order that if i were to come here again it also comes with a side of fries which were crispy and perfectly seasoned i also tried the grilled cheese and mushroom and chicken crepe they were delicious and perfectly cookedone downside is that after placing our order we decided we wanted to try the fries and ordered it from our waiter he failed to mention that the two of our dishes came with fries and we had no idea so we had  fries for  people and it was way too much we tried the creme brle for dessert and it was good creamy in the middle and crispy on top try to sit on the patio for a wonderful view of the strip and the fountains of bellagio|affordable and cool atmosphere with the egypt theme  its easy to fall under the spell of the place cool view from the rooms looking into thr main gallery  elevators r very slow  i think it has something to do with the fact that they go up on a slant   breakfast options rstarbucks or starbucks they have two so thats a bust  easily connected to other south strip spots excalibur including one more upscale mandalay bay ill stay here again  maybe one day ill figure out what a resort fee is  all hotels r in on this scam|i hadnt been to luxor in years but booked a trip there because it was a decent pricei didnt try any of the facilities pool fitness center shows or any of that i stayed in a pyramid room judging from the look i was in one of the older parts of the hotel the elevators felt very rundown when going up and downthe room was decent maybe im used to more amenities in the hotels on the strip  even from the non higher end hotels it got the job doneluxor is in walking distance to other hotels excalibur mandalay bay new york new york and mgm grand its a little bit of a trek from other parts of the strip but doable i could walk to the aria through the various hotels and walkways in about  minutescasinowise i liked luxor because their tables are cheaper than the higher end casinos before my trip i was offered upgrade options by email if theres a next time i might take the offer id go again|this is my first time staying at luxor hotel their check in line was short and quick  we stayed at the east tower separated from the pyramid   we heard that rooms in these towers are newer and better than those of the pyramid so we booked it  room was simple  clean and small  our valet server and bell hopper were super nice and helpful|went for brunch right before the end of their brunch service the food was a little hit and miss i had a pear danish that was one of the best pastries ive had but then my breakfast was just okay the eggs were cooked perfectly and the bacon came the way i had asked but i thought the potato croquettes were a little bland and mealy my fianc had mussels that he really enjoyed but the frites that came with them were cold and overlooked the service was excellent and the bellini was delightful there were high highs but a couple lows as well i would come back for sure when the kitchen is in full swing and not trying to shut down|a bit of a disappointing experience since we had high hopes for this well reviewed restaurant i would say the food across the board was  stars i would have been happy with the flavor and quality of the food if it were at a low cost chain restaurant but at a place that is sold as a high end establishment the food was really mediocre i had a bib salad that was fine but bland it was overdressed and still had little flavor my roasted chicken dish had better flavor but the chicken was overlooked and dry and i did have to salt the dish my fianc had the tuna tartar which he said was also bland and lacking salt and acid the real bummer was his rabbit entre which he actually did send back we both rarely send food back but for the prices we thought it was worth being honest about the very poor quality of his dish where olives made up points with us was in how they handled the complaint about the rabbit dish our server was friendly although seemed overworked and didnt come by many times to our table he asked how our entrees were and when we werent satisfied he involved the manager they insisted on bringing a new dish for my fianc and even remade my chicken so we could eat together they manager recommended the lamb and my fianc was happy with that dish they also did not charge us for the entree for my fianc at all the service deserves  stars and if our server had less tables it would have been  stars im sure if i lived in the area i might give them another try to see if the issues we had with the food were just because of an off night but since we visit las vegas infrequently im sure well want to try another restaurant on our next visit|this review is long overduewhile enroute to las vegas on a red eye flight i was reading an inflight magazine when i noticed an ad for this restaurant  the advertisement called them the first and only authentic german beer hall and restaurant to call las vegas nv home  not only thattheyre a replica of munichs famed hofbruhaus but in an enclosed building  there was also an ad that offered a free mug per customer of their oktoberfest beer just for stopping in  we were excited because we have never been to munichanyway we arrived at the restaurant at lunchtime and there was a line of people waiting to get in  the building is quite large and has high ceilings that makes you feel like youre under a huge tent with painted indoor gardens  you could almost hear peoples conversation echo about  we were seated at a large community table as an attentive and friendly server came by  we thought about ordering only a snack to take advantage of the free beer advertisement   our order consisted of  pretzels and  small free mugs of their oktoberfest beer  the beer was cold crisp and clean tasting  we were told that the beer is imported from the same batches as what is made and served at the hofbru tents  we considered upgrading to a l stein but we knew that we had dinner reservations set for later that evening jumbo pretzel which was huge and served warm there were two types of mustards and an obazter obatzda cheese  we were familiar with the mustards but the cheese spreaddip was deliciously different  apparently it is a bavarian cheese delicacya mixture of soft cheeses and butter jumbo pretzel with bavarian liver mousse and obazter obatzda cheese  the liver mousse was light and flavorful i know some of you might be saying ewww but it was really good  i wished that there was a larger portion but it wouldve been overkillwe enjoyed both baked pretzels as they were served warm soft and a bit chewy  the pretzels and beers were perfect together and we were satiated  but theni looked at their dinner menu and spied schweinshaxe aka roasted pork shank with crispy skin  omgi started planning our return because they serve this specialty after pm  alas our stay in lv was only for a couple of days and as they say our dance card was filled  so just to keep my tastebuds focused i borrowed the picture of that pork shank  i will return  maybe the oompah band will be playing|good for what it is i guess i realized this show is just not my style very old fashioned which is how they market it so my bad i guess there was one scene with two guys who had some incredible isolation choreography and skills this alone was probably worth the cheap ticket but i did yawn several times throughout if youre fascinated by old school showgirls then this is for you|meh the holiday buffet brunch for  is not worth your money the only thing they have that is appetizing is prime rib and snow crab legs but even then the prime rib is just mediocre|i like how everything is categorized into the various types of food americanasianitalianunfortunately the food was nothing special but not terrible at leastservice is okaydecent|highly recommended by my friends that frequent this place  was excited to try it and was disappointed  ordered the filet and it was chared and the waiter didnt explain how the steaks were made and was overly cooked  returned it and took forever but the waiter was nice and took it off the bill  the sides were amazing the sauted mushrooms and the cream spinach |we stopped here to check out the scene on a sunday afternoon dozens of pinball machines and a few stand up arcade games awaited us ready to swallow our quarters our reward blinking lights popping sounds and smiles on our faces  the games were closer together than would be ideal so im not giving  stars however it was a great way to be transported back to my childhood i felt like i was back in the wizard den arcade in the s again|terrific assortment of pastries and sweets had to stop in almost every evening for a second desert after dinner everything tasted just as good as it looked|this is where i have trouble rating an establishment because of that delicate balance between quality and value  desserts themselves were overall  star quality but the prices are definitely touristyi tried two scoops of gelato in a cup  coconut and pistachio  for something like   the pistachio was to die for  i mean they got the flavor right on and it even has chunks of real pistachio nuts infused in the ice cream  i love that  the coconut was okay but probably a little too sweet for me which means its way too sweet for the average joe  my friends each bought an individualsized dessert for  each  add on tax and its over   are the desserts beautifully crafted and delectable to eat  of course they are  is it worth  a pop  practically no  unless youre on vacation and spending mode which we were  but you can also have allyoucan eat at the wicked spoon for  and eat just  equally impressive dessert services and make your money back  or maybe ive just been jaded by my gluttony at the buffets someone please help me|the lunch buffet was  and i feel for the price it was a good value considering it was in the wynn hotelcasino and considering prices for restaurants on the strip  there was a huge spread of food and it was great  the service was ok albeit a bit slow  the waitress was friendly but we didnt see much of her throughout our meal|despite all of the harsh reviews on here lol we enjoyed our food very much  the ambiance was nice and our waiter was absolutely accommodating  when we wentit was crowded and mostly everyone dining were asians and if the food wasnt good or close to how it should taste you probably wouldnt see them there eating  i think some ppl may be disappointed because they are chasing the panda express taste red  wont deliver that  we ordered the xo string beans excellent xo flavor yangzhou fried rice lots of shrimp and good flavor hk style wonton egg noodle soup mapo tofu excellent flavor and pork  preserved egg congee  these were all finished between  adults and a child  it tasted just as good as you can get in rosemead or monterey park except of course at a much higher price but its a given when you dine inside the hotel  for now from the  dishes we had they get  stars  we will definitely be back again next time on our stay and try more|this was our first buffet in las vegas we got the buffet in buffets and this was our first stop we were there at  sunday afternoon hardly anybody in the line so we were seated right away the food was good i like their prime rib asian session and gelato overall i would like to give them a star|one of the better chines options on campus i like their beef with broccoli and chow fun when i feel sick or stressed an order of chow fun and wonton soup is my feelbetter food one thing i dont like but completely understand is that they give people different menus based on if you speak chinese or not|le burger was very good lots of flavor not a fan of how small of a portion you get for  but this is a french restaurant in vegas after all  double whammy there the complimentary bread certainly helps fill you up so you dont leave too hungry however i was most unimpressed with the mcdonaldsesque fries also we had a major service failure while the staff once we were seated were friendly and accommodating we had an issue upon arrival for a pm reservation on saturday evening i called at pm the second i landed at las to advise we were running just a few minutes behind schedule the hostess  i believe her name was amanda  said i see your name on opentable well make a note of it and as long as youre here to be seated by pm when the kitchen closes youll be fine we arrived at pm on the dot and were rudely told that we missed our reservation and the kitchen was closed while we waited five minutes for the hostess to check if we can be seated she returned to tell us a flat out no well i wasnt born yesterday im not a sucker and i can handle a vegas attitude at a trendyglitzy restaurant i asked for the manager now at pm he comes over listens to my frustration and says ah yes but it is now after pm are you kidding me dude we were here before pm and it took over  minutes to first get a rude no and then for you to come to the front suffice it to say he did invite us in to be seated at the bar funny thing we were actually out of there before the majority of the other people dining|friendly service good food at a great price a quick and easy meal that keeps everyone in the family happy the ice cream machine was a nice little bonus the location wasnt great in the middle of a strip mall with nothing to really offer before or after the meal|i loved this place im a huge ocean lover seeing all of the sea life was awesome in my opinion the price was worth it i worked at birch aquarium awhile back and i loved it there but id say the birch is definitely smaller than shark reef and there was only a  dollar difference between the aquariums so im not that upset about how much they charged to get in the alligator was awesome and everything was really informative and great i loved the layout i could sit there for ages just watching the fishies and sharks love love love|good foodamazing veiw excellent service i love a place with history and a story to telldefinitely should be on the things to do in phoniex you will drop some coin left us spinning|i am a fan this place is always fabulous the food is good and the burgers are some of the best in the valley especially for a chain restaurant the meet is good and the breakers are filling with the right ratio of all of the toppings the buns are the right size and there is no masking a mediocre burger with too much bread  everything is excellent the staff is extraordinarily friendly and always go out of their way to make sure any special requests are taken care of the kids love all the decorations and the video games on the table dont hurt either you can now pay at the table also which is very neat|this is my goto coffee spot in phoenix coffee and other drinks are good food is good pastries are dangerously large and good i am not sure if they make them in house but they are exceptional and they go fast there are vegan and gf options as well i love that there is plenty of seating and places to plug in and the wifi is free and you dont have to dance with a barista and prove your worth for the pw  its written on the wall my one and only complaint is that whenever i leave here after having spent any more than ten minutes in the building i smell kinda bad my clothes and bagsetc soak up the unique smell of the place which is a mixture of coffee and something else some ventilation might help not sure its a dumb thing to complain about considering coffee shops smell like coffee there are times that i avoid going here because i have somewhere to go after and i dont want to carry that scent with me all day i would suggest a scone or muffin for sweets a hummus bagel for eats and a good old fashioned latte for a buzz|one of my favorite drunk foods on campus the bbq chicken bacon ranch pizza is by far my favorite especially when they have the thicker sicilian style also really good is the honey mustard chicken the mac n cheese pizza is a favorite among many of my friends but to me its too buttery to really taste right the long line at  am is kind of rough but definitely worth it|i give it  stars based on chicken quality my wife would give it  i thought it was unusual that the place was packed and drivethru line a mile long for a place that only sells chicken strips they were damn good and special sauce was very good but menu is too limited for me to return unless i had to have chicken strips aloha|i wont worry about going into details about the location and such for les since its already been said by others i will say i definitely never would have ventured out to find it if it werent for the high reviewsi ordered the  pork bahn mi and it was good but not great the pork was really tender and the pickled vegetables added solid flavor the cilantro added another dimension to the flavor and the jalapeno added a bit of kick i didnt really enjoy the baguette im a big fan of soft bread and this baguette was crusty on the outside which i dont mind but a bit chewy in the middle overall the sandwich was pretty tasty but it was too much bread and not good enough bread for me to love for  it was at least a footlong sandwich though so the value is there sandwich taste price location |my favorite sushi restaurant on this side of town especially because its all you can eat we always order the screaming organum garlic tune sashimi and me so horny the service is always good and the tools come out extremely quick great quality sushi always fresh being from california i am very picky about my sushi and have never had any issues here i recommend this place to everyone that loves sushi and its totally worth the price plus they have a gear happy hour glasses of pinot noir for |this place has a fun and welcoming atmosphere the food is good too i had a fish dish that was fresh and tasty  ive been here a few times so it must be pretty good i love the outside seating as well as the bar area there is always activity around|great brunch spot located on the waterfront in scottsdale great outside patio and dining options for big groups and private parties great sam fox environment decent menu and drink selection i would recommend ordering a bellini or three and asking for the pesto and bread free great for the whole family group of friends or a happy hour|i know why you wait in line i thought like everyone else does that they should give us a pager while we wait and then just gamble away ok heres my theory why they make us wait waiting creates memories friendships with strangers and best of all hunger we have met the same stranger here twice in line and it was out of this world the people that come here are so outgoing i love this place why wait because you will be happy|breakfast  includes two eggs any style ham or bacon wheat or corn tortillas and southwest potatoes delicious way to start the morning the ambience of the miracle mile with the blue sky and clouds above make outdoor dining indoor dining so weather is not effective highly recommend ask for maria|food was pretty mediocre bonus points for free beer and wine  the fancy coke machines misleading sign for gelato over the froyo station would rather pony up the extra dough for a better quality buffet next time|nice smart layout staff friendly and the arcs concert was well organized at the door kept people moving cool venue for a show|incredible food horrible service both times by pretentious server jordan  he messed up order and blamed us that we misordered service  repeat order back  if large ego allows  also forgot to order items and never asked when we wanted things brought out  miso soup first oops forgot to order  support staff yvette was pleasant  attentive   days later service still sucks charged same card twice on split bill  get over yourself jordan|we arrived at rising sun deli around  on a weekday a waitress greeted us a we walked in and told us to take a seat wherever we liked we sat near the door i would not recommend this on a cold wisconsin day every time a customer came in or out a cold wind came with themwe started with the kalapao and beef jerky the jerky was sweet tangy chewy not dry and utterly delicious i could eat a plate of that the kalapao is a sweet bun filled with pork and hardboiled egg it was rustic looking but the sweet but and the savory filling was a winning combination i loved itfor our entrees and i had the pho and my dining companion had a duck soup the broth in the pho was spot on  beefy layered with flavor and complexity usually pho comes accompanied by a plate of condiments such as basil bean sprouts jalapenos and lime at rising suns deli they were already in the pho there was soy sauce fish sauce hoisin sauce and sriracha at the table to enhance the pho as desired even though i couldnt add my own proportions as desired i was extremely pleased with the pho my dining companion said the flavors of the duck soup were also spot on there was quite a bit of extra fat and gristle thoughone thing to keep in mind is that rising suns deli does not take creditcards so you will need to bring cashthere were many dishes on the menu i look forward to trying this probably isnt a place you would go if you are trying to impress a date but i can see myself going back over and over good food decent prices reasonable service|for a holeinthewall taco shop the  combo of  carne asada tacos with rice and beans was decent previous reviewers are correct in that the salsas are all absolutely delicious especially the verde the carne in the tacos is not very good quality and tasted about a half step up from ground beef to me i think why people like it is because it was very fatty meat the beans were awful very little taste at all and soupy consistency the rice was just as bad i drowned both these sides in salsa just to make them edible great that you can enjoy with a mexican coke no beer though parkings a bitch but made up for it with the ability to dine watching telenovelas|best margaritas and pollo fundio  absolutely the worst happy hour tacos ever  nice setting just dont order the tacos|agree with the indifferent service must be fun in the back room  also why is it so hard to get a few slices of ripe tomato|big mac no onions at am after star wars they delivered the perfect big mac meal fresh fast and hot great job for a late night  snack may the force be with you|we went to go get a free burger because thats what reward was showing on my app however because of their promotion we had to do the buy one get one  off unless we prepared before hand and selected to get the free burger when we went to red robin i dont like this because its forcing me to use what promotion they are running versus getting my reward i earned  my server acted like it was a unreasable request to pick my reward versus their promotion i feel like the automated paying at the table is moving away from good custoemr service as well red robin is one of my favorites to go to  i will continue to go there however i wish they would take a look at their processes my server was ok however ive had better my burger was excellent and always is thats why im a loyal customer|tamales are good but seems like they are starting to have more masa then meat also be prepared to get no customer service the ly lack those skills on every level patience is a must|i used to love this place a few years ago before they got really popular friday and saturday nights are the best if you want to be in a club atmosphere mid day any day of the week is good to just chill and smoke hookah the service can be bad if you are there on a busy night servers will neglect and forget you from my own recent experience this is why they get  stars|i saw debbie  the pahrump location she took the time to answer all of my questions i had to to change drs due to ins change i was very pleased with her and her staffhowever they sent an rx over to my pharmacy and they didnt receive it it has been  days of trying to get a hold of someone on the phone to get it filled i just want to talk to someone|at most my recent visit canyon ranch spaclub ran a promotion for  off spa services i booked a canyon ranch massage that gives access to the spa amenities as well  whats great about the spa is that there are in and out privileges throughout the day at the front check i checked into the spa an hour prior to my appointment i was then escorted to the womens lounge area and was given a pair of spa shoes  since it was my first time at this spa i got a quick tour of its facilities  the womens lounge area was quite large and clean  each guest has access to their own personal locker  the womens lounge area consisted of showers restrooms and sinks with vanities  they even provided toiletries and hair appliances that included a hair dryer and flat ironpast the womens lounge were a several rooms to relax such as a sauna steam room cool room jacuzzi and more that section of the spa looked a bit dated but it was clean  also throughout the womens lounge was fresh fruit and fruit infused waterthere is also a coed area that also serves as a waiting room for services  in the coed area theres a wave room and salt room  it would be great if they had more coed roomsonto the massage prior to my massage the masseuse asked me if there were certain areas that need to be worked on  signs of a good massage  minutes later i was in total relaxation and almost fell asleepoverall i had a great time at canyon ranch spa especially at  off if youre staying at the palazzo or venetian its worth checking out you can literally spend half the day here tip check canyon ranch spas facebook page for current promotions it saved me |great food favorite is orange blossom special ayce is great they have a frequent acye punch card we have come so much we used it comfortable been there many times in the past year love it|my wife had the sea bass  excellent  to  oz perfectly seared on a bed of spinch i had the shrimp lo mein very good lots of shrimp i think around   i requested extra hot and the server corrected my designation to something like spicy and it was great added hot mustard and red pepper sauce excellent my mouth is still burning  we left with two large  go boxesalso had the chicken lettuce wrap lots of chicken it was a great opening to a delicious dinner total cocktails and the above food plus tip was around   a little pricy but very high quality and excellent servicewe arrived around  on a sunday seated immediately by the time we left close to  there was a packed house and a  to  minute wait|its been a while since i visited manhattan pizza i used to frequent this place for their pizzas and wings ordered buffalo wings this time and they were finger licking good greasy crunchy and tasty not battered not undercooked and not undersized either some might argue that the owner is a little rough around the edges but i disagree language might be the issue here he went out of his way to understand my order over the phone and even included extra sauce for my wings without me asking|the daughter and i have visited this establishment about  times over the last  years  each visit was doing our annual pilgramige to sin city  as a little girl she would love to stand on the stairwell and dance to the irish music  now as a teenager she is too shy to dance with the irish music in front of everyone  but she truly loves going back to visit  the food is excellent the steaks are great and the salmon entree is to die for  several times i f let like i was in an irish pub back in ireland  you cant go wrong coming here|great food and a nice place but the service is really slow so if your not in a rush its a great place to eat|great spot for some beef or chicken teriyaki platters  the food is consistent and fresh  only concern is how the meats are chopped up very finely as opposed to most places that have larger chunks of meat  i enjoy the mixed yogis plate with chicken and beef and rice plus salad and orange  just started using the brown rice substitute as a healthy alternative  sometimes ill get the fried potstickers when im super hungry or craving them  nothing special about the potstickers as ive had authentic and better ones elsewhere  convenient location on the west side of town near tropicana and the   shopping center doesnt have much parking for the amount of businesses and restaurants  yogis is great after a long night out and youre craving some quick delicious teriyaki|good illussions  the bowling ball trick and finally with the giant statue were really cool  the one with the box where its cuts in quarters and he disappears and reappears seems to defy all explanationhe moves between tricks pretty quickly too so there r a lot of illuuuuusionsshow is very affordable and opening act with the masks is  very funny although i refused to be volunteereda few down notes  the kid volunteer was in a mind reading skit  the magical effect of mindreading on a six yr old is nullandvoid  he should have been in a plate spinning or disappearing trick or at the least a rabbit out of a hat trick  not surprisingly the kid looked bored and uninterested   one trick the close up magic trick took place in the back of the room forcing  of the theater to watch it on a tv screen  magic on a tv screen doesnt interest anyone  the straight jacket escape looked pretty pointless  he just wiggles out of it  whats the gag|ill be generous and say its a my team and i came here for our holiday lunch we arrived a little before noon and were seated immediately the menu wasnt extensive for lunch but it gave us enough options to all try something different i decided to go with the lasagna bolognese it was classic it really packed a rich bold flavor i would have liked it to be a bit warmer when it arrived to the table but it had all the stuff it needed to be a really good dish  my main issue was the service it was just meh ill chalk it up to our waiter being the only one on the floor during the lunch rush but it was definitely lacking that extra touch that i expected based on others reviews i may come back and give them a try for dinner just to see if i can add them to my list of italian favs but for now they are just aok|stopped here today after having a bad eczema breakout they allow you to make your appointment online to avoid waiting i did that which was convenient and did not have to wait long however when i got there i did have to wait a bit more than expected maybe about    minutes which i know isnt long but i was having a severe itch attack and those  minutes felt long when i was taken back the nurse was very kind which is always great the doctor i assume came in moments after he was not wearing a white coat and they did not introduce him as the doctor so i am not sure if he was a pa or doctor regardless  i found him to be a bit  uneducated i told him i was having a eczema flare out and that my doctor back home  i do not live in az told me to go to a minute clinic and get prescribed some antihistamine cream not steroid  when i told the next stop care doctorpa this he did not seem to know what i was talking about he told me he was not familiar with non steroidal creams for eczema i found this to be kinda strange considering he was the doctor and i was the patient he then went and searched on his computer and came back and said that he usually doesnt prescribed elidel a non steroid cream but he would for me this time anyhow i just found his manner to be a bit off and non professional however in the end i got my prescription for elidel and left  overall  it was a successful visit id say i got what i needed however i do not know if i would particularly go back |must try when in vegas this is located inside planet hollywood they are fast and efficient you can add sides into your sandwiches such as onions at no extra cost cheap and yummy open  |nice decor very obviously a kimpton which isnt a bad thing per se friendly service great gnocchi spaghetti and scallops wine was good and gelato and sorbets were tasty tiramasu was drenched in extra chocolate which would delight some diners but i am a purist|good but not great  service was not good at allwe had a family christmas outing with dinner and a show  the capital grille was the familys first choice as we had always had a good experience with past visits to cgwe were seated promptly upon arriving and then proceeded to wait  minutes for anyone to stop at the table  other tables were being sat and served and we sat and sat and sat  when we finally ordered drinks and they were served we let the server know that we had a  pm show to attend and that we needed to pick up the pace  no response and service lagged onto make a long story short the food was wonderful as usual but the service made the experience a poor one  we had zero time for coffee or dessert and barely made the showyou would think when someone makes a  pm reservation on a saturday evening the staff would realize that you have to be somewhere for a showa usually good goto place in town was very very disappointing|the format is the same as most every other brazilian steakhouse weve been to in the us there is a set price which includes the buffet and all of the meats drinks and desserts if you choose to have them are extrawe arrived fairly late on a saturday evening we had reservations and were seated immediately samba was busy but not crowded our waitress arrived shortly brought a basket of yucca puffs filled with cheese took our drink order explained how it works and then we headed toward the salad bar the salad bar has a good selection of both hot and cold items i thought the swiss brick and blue cheeses were all top notch there were regular and spicy almonds spinach mixed greens romaine were all available for making a cold salad marinated artichokes and hearts of palm made for some tasty and unusual ingredients there was a chickpea salad a curried potato salad and a pesto pasta salad with sundried tomatoes a couple of soups were available and well as an incredibly delicious lamb and blackbean stew which i devoured this wasnt the most extensive salad bard ive seen at a brazilian steakhouse but it contained a good mix of traditional american items with a good mix of brazilian items to please all tastes the hardest part about the salad bar is making sure you leave for all of the meats to comethe evening we were there the skewers of meats included a sausage mango chicken garlic chicken wings pork wparmesan cheese flank steak sirloin steak lamb and pineapple obviously not a meat but served like one the lamb sirloin and pork were all delicious they were brought around multiple times and you could have multiple servings each time if you so desired the flank steak was a little tough and was not my favorite until i got some chimichurri sauce from the salad bar wow this was great i should have gotten this from the beginning its a green sauce of parsley garlic olive oil oregano and vinegar it really matched the flank steak and made it singour beverages were also very good cachaca and rum were the primary liquors they were delicious large and priced as you would expect at finedining restaurantwe didnt save room for the desserts they are extra  in the    rangethis isnt a place i would go every week its just too much food and you are paying for it but i will definitely go back just make sure you are particularly hungry and hungry for a lot of meat|we made reservations for  on sunday night after a performance at mesa center for the arts  they were all set up and ready for us  we made it for happy hour beverages and enjoyed the chips and salsa  there seemed to be a little confusion about who was our server  shortly one of the guys came over to take orders  food came out fairly quickly and was simple  i had the blue seafood enchiladas which were delicious  blue corn tortillas filled with shrimp lobster and a white fish everyone enjoyed their meal  our server split our check four ways such made paying quick and easy  id recommend this restaurant for small or bigger groups  in fact its a cute place for a date night|whats not to like all you coffee beaners know how its like cappuccinos sandwiches munchies wifi the usual its getting a bit heavy on the laptopcablechargerstudentworker side its time someone opened a cool coworking space with caf in this market place|very trendy nightlife spot in old town  not a great spot for families especially toward the later dinner times but is a great place for groups to get some awesome sushi and drinks  priced about the same as the rest of old town so youll spend some money here but its worth it|love this place havent had a thing in here that wasnt delicious usually i order fried rice without soy sauce which is great tasting  only thing that doesnt make sense is i cant order a cup of hot  sour soup each portion is made to order but who is going to eat a gallon of hot  sour soup the water is filtered which is always a plus in the desert  i just ordered the singapore noodles they tasted a little salty and didnt really make an impression the noodles were cooked perfectly  it wasnt bad or good i liked it but wouldnt order it again|generally the only time we visit this location is when we want to see an imax movie i was surprised to see that they have added a bar where you can have a pre movie drink and also take a drink to go to enjoy the movie nice touch the reason for only  stars is because the theater was not cleaned well between movies and the bathroom trash was totally overflowing it sucks to find a seat and have someone elses garbage there i know its a busy time but those are two things that need to be done|i love the food at cafe rio its great portions and good prices as much as i love the food im giving this particular location  stars because customer service was awful i walked in to a busy joint but when you looked at the employees they werent friendly and they looked like they hated their jobs in fact one employee who worked on my tostada gave attitude to a fellow employee in front of me and other customers i felt bad for the cashier because my order was incomplete as the employee who gave attitude forgot to give me dressing with my meal and i asked the cashier who seemingly was afraid to ask because of the attitude of one of the fellow employees i was absolutely ashamed for this location because each employee didnt seem to smile or show any hospitality|well i ordered bacon and cheese fries but was then told that they were out of bacon no big deal i downgraded to the ordinary cheese fries which looked very promising but they tasted pretty terrible the cheese sauce was disgusting and i can still feel it just sitting in my stomach plotting to ruin my toilet here soon service was less than great our waitress forgot to give us menus and asked if we knew what we wanted even though we had no menus to look at she couldve sworn she gave us some she also had to come back and ask my friend what he wanted for a second time because she forgot bruh however she was always nice and seemed fairly competent perhaps just having a bad day or a derp moment as we all do from time to time overall i was not repelled by the service but rather the nasty cheese fries i usually enjoy the rest of the menu so im sure ill still come back just keep that cheese sauce heated and stirred regularly and above all else keep it away from my fries|great food it was hot the service was great make sure you have someone in your party to hold a seat before you orderif you are eating inthe place is usually packed|clean with contemporary and open feel friendly service typical american coffee shop with burgers sandwiches plates around  per person i tried the chicken noodle soup turkey club sandwich and burger which were all decent and tasty but not memorable the fries are thin shoestrings which are tasty and a generous portion is provided and they do accept silverton points as payment which is how we ended up here  stars|though i had been to this theater a couple times over the last five years the southside works cinema was my destination on friday night to see the star wars movie my husband and his coworker chose the theater based on proximity to their workplace and avoiding the much larger and likely much more insane theater at the nearby waterfrontthe theater was literally filled with lines of people anxiously lined up and waiting to see their assigned showing of the film the theater should have bought or rented line barriersropes to keep everyone contained and orderly in both the theater lines and even more so for the snack lines i waited in line for about  minutes to buy some water and candy and had to step one way or another almost constantly to avoid getting jostled by other people cutting throughoutside of these massive record breaking crowd opportunities the theater is descent the chairs werent very comfortable in my opinion but i really had no complaints other than that|service is sub par we werent greeted upon entry which is almost always a preview of how your service will be like although our server was friendly he was not very attentive i looked around at the other tables and it did not appear that servers were checking on their tables unless its a scottsdale thing where people like to be left alone three stars is for the food i want to be fair and the food is pretty good not great but worth a try we ordered beef lo mein which had the most tender pieces of beef perfectly medium rare however the entire dish had the burnt wok taste kind of like what it tastes like when the grill needs to be cleaned the honey walnut shrimp was served on a bed of rice clearly the food here is served for individuals rather than family style we shared everything family style anyway lastly we ordered the meatloaf not sure how this fits into asian fusion and it was just okay|despite this apple store always being packed ive been greeted promptly on each visit  the staff mostly younger employees are knowledgeable and helpful about the products they are selling i was able to get in and purchase a new macbook in literally  min  i dont like to be pushed or feel like im being sold and they understand this|a really quant bakery in downtown champaign that does cupcakes very well the red velvet cupcakes with cream cheese frosting really are special i came here for my th birthday because all i wanted was a great red velvet cupcake and they did not disappoint|we stopped in to see how the tasty chocolates are made yesterday however the lines were shut down understandable since it was sunday we could still see the machines and was video snippets about how they make the chocolate enjoyed the sample of chocolate choice of white milk or dark we shopped in the mm store next door and explored the adjacent cactus garden for free finally we stopped and snapped a photo with our family next to the giant chocolate cactus|typical bar food atmosphere cant complain it was free food really enjoyed the sporty atmosphere and i love the location ate here my first time in in this town definitely a memorable visit the food was ok but its just a fun place to visit when youre in town|ive now stayed at this place for two separate nights the first time was perfect as i was only looking for a place to stay the night i didnt care to checkout the breakfast because i didnt want to get up that early the second time i stayed there was a little less enjoyable the room was located on the back side of the hotel and i could hear the highway throughout the night also around  am i could hear some people in the parking lot talking although this only lasted for about  minutes so for the price this place is good and ill definitely stay here again|my first time went for lunch on a saturday with  friends we ordered an the tejas trio app very good there was s happy hour menu on the table so i ordered what i thought was a  draft beer but it wasnt happy hour yet so i was billed  no fun i asked for spinach in my mac n cheese they accommodated w no extra charge that was nice my gf asked why there was no cornbread i guess they used to serve this free like chips n salsa at a mexican joint server told us that the cornbread was replaced w free chips and salsa which we never received when we pointed that out the server tried to song and dance around it rather than apologize and move on my husband enjoyed his entree the fajitas but was disappointed at the volume and the fact that he was up sold without being told the server had asked if he wanted steak shrimp or chicken or two of the  its extra to have a combo its not close enough that we will go back|i lived in southern highland so on my weekend off my family and i always stop by and grub some drinks i loved the place clean and staff seem very friendly but the service can takes an hour is a long wait i loved starbucks and been every places so far this place is not fast enough|stopped for breakfast on the way to tonto national forest  coffee and service were both excellent  i had the cowgirl though im an urban cowboy at heart which was fried chicken with sausage gravy and green pork chili with two eggs potatoes and toast  yes this is a real dish  the sausage gravy was a little rich for my liking  the green pork chili however was out of this world good  staff was so friendly making for a nice time|we brought a group of  in this past weekend it was a fun time and the logistics of it all went smooth but the lanes kept breaking down at one point they switched one group to an entirely different lane and then the other lanes kept going down as well we probably wont come back to sports connection next time for our group bowling the staff was great but the lanes need some serious tlc when youre paying per hour its frustrating to continually loose time waiting for the lanes to get fixed again great staff just poor machinery on the lanes|une boulangerie qui offre beaucoup de choix de pains et de ptisseries mais peu de baguettes ou de sandwichs diffrents par contre jai got le pain entier qui est trs bon mais pas donn en effet les prix sont un peu levs toutes les ptisseries faisaient envie mais aucune ntait vgtalienne je nai donc pas pu tester malheureusement|dont you just love discovering tiny restaurants that dont look like much but turn out to be amazing  that is what an experience at restaurant iris an el salvadorian restaurant is like  when you first enter it looks very plain but as we all know looks can be deceivingits a small operation  there arent that many seats in the restaurant and there were only about two people working when we came by one in the kitchen and one waiting the tables  that being said though they did a good job at getting the orders out in a reasonable time frame and dealing with other customers as they came into the restaurantif its your first time trying salvadorian food then you should try pupusas which are amazing here  these can best be described as thick corn tortillas stuffed with filling  youre also supposed to add curtido and tomato sauce on top of the pupusa to dress it  curtido is a cabbage salad almost like cole slaw  we ordered a bunch of different pupusas which included chicken pork and cheese and just cheese  my personal favourite was the pork and cheese  we also got a pitcher of horchata which is a milk drink that contains spices like cinnamon  this particular horchata was also quite nutty and very refreshingfor dessert we split a three milk cake and some kind of pineapple dessert which i cant remember the name of  i enjoyed the three milk cake quite a bit but i do wish that it had a little more of the three milk sauce  the other dessert consisted of a pineapple filling in some kind of cake  i must admit that this was the low point for me as i found it to be a little too dry  that being said the meal as a whole was awesomepricewise it is very inexpensive  i was blown away by how cheap my meal was  after tip i paid a little less than  which considering the quality and quantity of the food was a steal|this is the famous montreal smoked meat place i have lived in montreal my entire life but i have never made it out to schwartzs until recently because of this i was well familiar with smoked meat before this experienceschwartzs is a very basic restaurant in terms of atmosphere nothing but a bar and a bunch of tables while this might deter some people i feel this is part of the charmone thing that caught me by surprise is that there doesnt seem to be any combos i wanted a smoked meat sandwich fries and a soft drink so i had to buy each item separately after tax and tip this comes to about the smoked meat is quite good although it is of the drier variety which is not my favourite the fries were fine as wellin the end this is a very basic smoked meat experience the food is good but i think it is more expensive than this meal should be|ddc is extremely popular and i can understand whythey have a large selection of microbrew beers which rotate regularly this place is often full but its not too hard to find a tablethe atmosphere is quite dark and loud but its a very relaxed placemy only complaint is that their selection usually tends to be heavy on the stout and ipa side which can be frustrating if you are a fan of these beers one advantage though is their flights where you can select three different beers to try rather than getting a pint of a single typeif you are a fan of microbreweries ddc is definitely a place to try|best sushi on the west island the owners dustin and sara take great pride in serving fresh well made dishes|this is a very popular and live karaoke bar the private rooms make it so much better because its only you and your friends and you can pick whatever songs you want to sing they have a wide array of choices and the seats and atmosphere in the room is so comfortable the food is okay over priced and not the best quality in my opinion when we go here we always make it dinner and karaoke night have dinner elsewhere and then come for karaoke here make a reservation like i said its a very popular place and if you have a big party it will just be easier i like how they dont mind splitting the check a million ways which i know can get complicated seems like they are used to it they charge by the minute so of your on a budget set a reminder on your phone or something a minute or two before the time you want to leave|i grabbed a quick order of humus and grape leaves to go good and fast with friendly staff ill be back|weve been coming here for  years its not always the promptest of service but its tasty reasonably priced italian food my family loves the meatball pizza and eggplant parmesan|red oak is always delicious whether i get a salad smoothie juice or sandwich i have never been disappointed im only ever sad when i try and go on sundays for brunch the juices are to die for the the service is always quick and they are very kind here|this is a great place especially for a romantic dinner with a loved one quiet atmosphere helpful staff and delicious food made this restaurant the newest addition in my list of places i want to go back to slight cons the waiters were slightly distracted at times which wasnt very professional in my opinion and the tables were a bit close to one another which can get uncomfortable especially if your fellow diners are loud or unpleasant in any wayaltogether though i heartily recommend this place|in this place lack of ambiance is a plus theyre not presumptuous but the fish is fresh and ive liked every roll ive ever ordered here especially love the lovely dsc|the beer selection is the obvious reason this place is great the prices food and service most times has left this restaurant less to be desired i hope it gets better because i still continue to make my way to the yardhouse|its a casino caffeine staple location used to be a wine bar back in the lvh days but now they serve morning and evening beverage purposes in one setting though which one you opt for at what time is apparently flexible here in vegasas other reviews mention a drink and pastry will set you back  but my iced chai was just right and my bear claw was beautiful so i guess i dont blame them prices arent so absurdly high that youll compare it to highway robbery and some people find the fact that they brew starbucks coffee comforting probably the same people who kept the onsite pizza hut in businessdinein area is small but adequate with ample peoplewatching overlooking the casino floor convenient location at main intersection of towers just off the check in area|lyrics  al green  how can you mend a broken hearti can think of other places when to have my lunchwas everything a yelper could want to doi could always eat vietnamesei was never told about their nam nuonghow can you mend a broken ricehow can i try the pork and eggrolls now tell mehow can you stop that fish sauce from flowingwhat makes my world go roundcom tam thuan kieu i would say is best known for their broken rice entree  i usually go for that before i even think about browsing the menu  secondly i think their nam nuong is probably one of my favorites in town charbroiled vietnamese sausage strips lettuces fried noodles and bean sprouts  the texture of the cured salty meat and smokiness is accompanied by the crunchy texture of the fried noodles bean sprouts and lettuce  along with this delectable dish is the sauce which is orange in color with a peanut and what i can only describe as somewhat like a red pepper aioli and red chili mixture  i could be wrong but its definitely the star of the night for me  for my entree i went with a broken rice dish of course which came with the vietnamese meat sausage shredded pork skin eggrolls pork chops bean curd skin with shrimp and shrimp paste  yes indeed it was a loaded dish  i would say my favorites were the eggrolls and the pork chops  eggrolls here are tad bit different from what im used to  the ingredients within is familiar but the shell itself is what i describe as a crustacean like look with an extra crunchy stickiness to it since it has the tendency to stick to your teeth slightly as you bite into it  overall com tam thuan kieu has been around since the start of mekong plaza so theyre definitely doing something right  service can be a hit or miss here but nothing you can complain about  enjoy|not bad not mind blowing i got an ice cream sandwich with vanilla ice cream and white chocolate chip macadamia nut cookies it was about  after tax it definitely did not last the mile drive home to the other side of the capitol so im not sure how delivery would work with that sort of item overall it was a little more than id want to spend on something i could make at home easily on the other hand it might be good drunk food when bar hoping on state|sunday night prime christmas party season  this place should have been packed  an absolute hidden gem any time of the year but a great option at christmas with their great value great choice and great serviceim so grateful that the uye christmas dinner introduced the hubby and i to this great restaurant  we loved everything  comfortable setting with a clean fresh yet cosy interior  the staff were efficient relaxed and fun  the menu was fantastic  when i first asked my husband if he wanted to come along he hesitated  most restaurants put on a stripped down christmas menu and often replace their signature dishes for turkey and stuffing  when we checked the blonde holiday menu we were really excited by the wide variety of options which stayed true to their regular menu  but for a great price of  for  courses  other restaurants should learn from blonde  use the christmas menu as a way to introduce diners to the best you have to offer  not as an excuse to pass off mass produced roasts at an inflated price but back to our meal  it was hard to choose but we started with the black pudding on a spelt salad and the spinach filo parcels  i know my hubby loves anything with black pudding but we were both surprised by how much he loved the healthier portions of his starter  the spelt and especially the dollop of eggplant cream  id never get him to try anything like that at home  my filo parcels were delectable  loads of spinach inside crispy on the outside and on a bed of a light caponatalike sauce that i practically licked off the plate  a big portion of potato salad made this starter feel more like a meal  i would easily have been satisfied with just that but im glad there was more to comeour venison and oxcheek mains were both well cooked presented and well balanced with the side vegetables  only a small niggle with the ox cheek  i was immersed in the soft tender meat  which didnt need a knife as it just fell apart when i was suddenly brought back to reality by a bitter blast as i bit down on a whole pink peppercorn  i use whole peppercorns in my sauces but i strain them out before returning the stock to the pan for the final thickening  not a major issue as once i realised they were there it was easy to pick them outdessert was a very rich moist flourless chocolate cake drowned in a salted caramel sauce  this sauce was just to my taste  not super sweet with a strong caramel flavour similar to the top of a creme brulee another plate lickingly good sauceonly other niggle was the winebeer selection  not many whites by the glass and the beers were all lagers light ales  i would have loved a dark or amber option especially when venison and ox were on the menuoverall a great night out with great company and a new restaurant to add to our hidden gem list  blonde we will be back|i like it a nice friendly pub on south clerk street with a typical but tasty selection of food and drink i particularly enjoy the breakfast theres a good breakfast deal with toast and tea or coffee which goes down a treat particularly when ive woken up too late to get breakfast at the student halls not an uncommon occurrence ive also been once for dinner and theres a nice selection of dishes all the things youd expect like fish and chips etcstaff members are friendly and helpful prices are good and the atmosphere is usually relaxed|nice place more quiet than the bowling in fountainparkit also has a pool table air hockey table and morethe good nice staff  per game promotion between pm and pm but as it is a special please check in advance renting of shoes adds another so we each had two games and shoes for  bargainthe bad so many things went wrong with the bowling computer ok things happen but maybe once we at least had  issues several times somebody only had  throw instead of twoalso the arm that picks up the pins and puts them back for the second throw knocked pins over several times we were on on lane  especially frustrating if someone almost throws a spare and then there is no last pinalso only  seats per lane which is way too fewbecause of the wonderful price when the special is on i am still giving it  stars although i would give  if it was possible but i would be not happy if i had paid full|great thai on the north side and byob  be careful with their  hot scale it is horribly inconsistent i like hot and go with a  every time im there and every time it is a different  ranging from no heat to melt your face wish they had the crispy duck salad that was at their downtown location|premade juices mixed at the bar i expected to watch them make a fresh juice with the  extractors at the bar but i am told that they are made fresh daily during morning prep understandably the menu is a little pricy chorizo and eggs fresh veggie juices and fruit smoothies breakfast sandwich avocado eggs benedict shrimp ceviche breakfast wrap and bloody mary cocktails are delicious the front desk service from the managergreeter is a little oblivious and pretentious but guess thats expected at the posh spa pinky fingers up daniela is an excellent server and bartender please see her if youd like a tasty drink|huge large variety eatery upstairs come with lots of energy and money youll want more than you came in for|came here to grub with my girlfriend everything is average quality dont order anything seered from here its just propane on fish ruins the taste completely the slices of superwhite were extremely thin and had none of the butteryness the only thing i semi enjoyed was the sashime included with aycejust take the jalapenos of and replace with daikon that spice too overwhelming with glob of siracha|i always liked cheese cake factory but never loved it  the food is good and reasonably priced and service usually very good  but for some reason i dont comprehend why its always busy esp on a sunday night like last night with over  people waiting while all the tables were still full as we left  i had the bbq pork sandwich with sweet potato fries  there was a bit too much sauce but the cole slaw helped tame the od of sassy richness  overall i give my meal last night thumbs up  any cheesecake for dessert is a must with a multitude of selections to choose from  peace|i dont think we can handle any more ayce buffets but the idea of unlimited oysters and seafood options outweighed the potential minuses of ayce ooohhhh aching belly this time for some reason i just feel compelled to eat the buffet price in quantity  that means ooohhhh ok first the minuses seating is cafeteriastyle i mean metal chairs and laminatetables it definitely has an indian casino feel some buffet items were obviously not that fresh or great but since we ate almost  seafood and meat the meats we ate were of good quality fresh tender and not obviously subprime cuts prime rib good  have definitely had worse in prime rib restaurants leg of lamb which you dont often see was goodoysters  nice but we made sure we saw the guy put them out and got them fresh from him crab  its the usual buffet crab but the hot crab was hot and cold was cold asian ginger crab was pretty good asian mussels  not good mussel and clams in broth  good shrimps its what they have  thai slave shrimpdesserts  normally do not eat these but what the heck on the vegas buffet scale of gnarly desserts they have a nice combination of lighter choices like gelato sorbet and i think  real coconut milk gelato very good they have good meringues good small cakes like carrot cake and childpleasing candy coated rainbow marshmallows if you are a total pig you will like this buffet i think its probably priced exactly right for being offstrip having some pretty good folk back in the kitchen who definitely seem to care about their quality and expressing creativity desserts salads within the format and very nice serversyes the booze is free  vendange wine various beers hard cider and the best thing in buffet tap root beer  think death valley and it is good if you factor in you can get trashed and eat crab legs shrimp meat etc then yeah a good trip off the strip do not gamble in the casino|ill be honest  if the pizza wasnt so dang on good i probably would never frequent the place again  most times i think they could care less whether youre there or not  the owner can come off as a bit cranky but i think its all part of her warm disposition or ive just worn her down with my continuous patronage and shes finally decided that she cant get rid of me no matter how much she ignores me  i think shes finally learned my name after only going there every friday for about a year now  i suspect they have a problem keeping employees who arent family because on those rare times when they are fully staffed the atmosphere is pleasant  so im going to say they are overworked and exhausted  but man if you like a pizza crust that has great flavor with a bit of a chew and toppings that leave a little greasy residue like pizza used to be before gluten  dairy  meat and pretty much flavor free become all the rage then this is the place to get it just dont expect them to be happy youre there giving them your hard earned money  heck  i guess they think theyve earned it cause they work hard too|very good we ordered a cookie dough sundae it was awesome we tried to split it between three people and still had a lot left it was great but big enough to share with a lot of people|what a great find this place is located in the hot trending uptown area of charlottethe walk up the staircase to the second floor balcony reminded me of the french quarter in new orleans it was about  pm on a tuesday and the place was packed i liked the dimly lit and dark wood ambience a well stocked bar decent wine and sake listwe sat and dined at the bar the menu is very gastro pub eclectic with things from sushi to a korean take on wings to ramen with goat cheese balls to ahi tacos to pork belly with watermelon tacos the thing is everything is really goodit was now about  pm and the place was getting even busier and the music playing from the dj was getting a little louder and better i kept thinking how much i was enjoying this place and the food and if i lived in charlotte i would be here quite oftentime for another drink|my fianc and i dined here tonight to celebrate his birthday first the food was delicious however the service was not when we walked in there was no hostess at the podium  so the very nice and attentive bartender went to the podium to greet us and acknowledged my fiancs birthday then the hostess finally came back and showed us to the table the ambiance was very nice we had a nice table next to the window overlooking the bellagio fountains when our server finally came he seemed very rushed and was very short with us the appetizers were not listed on the menu so we asked him what appetizers we had to choose from and he seemed irritated that he had to explain after choosing our appetizers we also ordered our entrees before he could walk away my fianc had the beet salad to start with and i had the spring salad with blood orange dressing both were tasty then we both had the short rib agnotoli which was delicious however if you plan on getting stuffed this is not the place to do so since the portions are small once we finished our entrees after quite some time the waiter finally came back and we ordered some dessert we waited about  minutes for our dessert ive never waited that long for dessert in my entire life when it was time to pay we gave the waiter our card after he ran the card and had our bill in hand he walked right past us without giving us our card back after about  minutes he finally came back smh weve had better service at the cheesecake factory although the food was delicious we just dont see ourselves returning to the restaurant in the future due to the bad service|they have many vegetarian options  the price is ok for vegetarian not like mr chows charge very expensive on veggie dishes|i see a lot of potential for this place during the summer months  unfortunately we came in november so everything was gloomy and not as green  even so there was a lot of nice areas where we could sit and relax  not to mention there were so many wonderful paths for biking running and hiking  what a great park in a great city|best avocado rolls in town not a pound of rice like other places avocados always looking fresh no browning here i give it four stars because the service is soooooo slow there were only  tables besides ours so i couldnt see the reason for the slow speed the food is good enough and prices are reasonable so its worth it|great salads and sandwiches and everyone in our party was happy with their food quiet atmosphere for conversation our server karen was prompt and attentive without being obtrusive|happened to buy discounted tickets  per person general admission tickets  however we got bumped to vip seating  there were  opener comedian followed by  other comedian   burlesque dancer   comedy is somewhat funny  burlesque show was below average|i have been coming here sense i was a child they have the best cheese steak sub in all of charlotte when someone asks me where can i get a good cheese steak without hesitation i tell them house of pizza  pizza is very good as well  i just cant get myself to order anything but the cheese steak  i always have them add a little pizza sause to mine just a suggestion  youll be glad you went there|i love this place weve been twice in the last month and have enjoyed it both times its hard to find a local dig where you get awesome food without spending  on a burger this place solves that with awesome burgers bellow  build your own you can even get bison which im a big fan of youve got to try the jalapeno bacon enough said the service has been great but expect a  minute wait at a minimum good food attracts a big crowd and this is no expectation great house beer great fries great everything|bit fancy asian food restaurant crowded at lunch time but waitress was quick in response and friendly singapore street noodles really taste like noodles with strong soy sauce flavour but its good as a whole not a large portion but prices are okay|this is a great tj maxx very clean and friendly staff the furniture stock is amazing a lot better than ive seen at other locations its lacking in the stationary department but other than that everything is pretty well stocked|flavor used to be good now its losing its taste might be switching to freezer made stuff not sure|we went to bonfyre for brunch because we had a citytin coaster for  off to use before the end of the year had only been here once before for drinks  the brunch was great decent prices delicious food all around  my boyfriend got the stuffed french toast with drunken bananas rum flambeed pecans and caramel  he loved it and said it wasnt cloyingly sweet but just the right mix of savorysugary  came with a side of bacon for   a steal really my daughter got a bacon cheeseburger a massive burger which was stunning skewered with a trio of pickles served on a whole grain bun and with a side of zucchini fries which she loved  my rotisserie chicken with eggs bacon and side salad was also scrumptious their chicken is perfectly done makes sense as its their specialty but im usually not a huge fan of white meat chicken while this was flavorful and and juicy  all in all we were impressed with the prices the service was pretty good and well try to detour out here another time for dinner  minus one star for the loud tvs everywhere took awhile for coffeewater refills and a fruit fly here and there probably because our table was just to the left of the bar|love this place the deserts are absolutely beautiful and very delicious they are a little too sweet for me but i always have a few bites and save the rest for a later snack its the perfect place to grab and espresso or champagne and a dessert to start the evening i have never tasted their wedding cakes but they are some of the most beautiful i have ever seen i love looking at their instagram as well|i go to the medical school attached to this hospital cafeteria so i eat here purely for functional purposes when you have less than an hour between class and your afternoon activity you dont really have time to go out and have a proper lunch that said the food here could definitely be worse after trying most everything here ive settled on either the burger station or the casserole station both are decent and the casserole station varies its daily entree at a very very affordable price  i can often get lunch for just  also i really like the fact that theyre very accommodating with dietary variations both for those with aesthetic as well as medical needs dont worry  you wont hate yourself for eating here i do it all the time and i havent gone insane yet|the view is plain awesome  the food is really good  the salsa is actually spicy  it does tend to get busy and when it gets busy it also gets on the loud side so if you want to have a quiet conversation timing is everything|our designer carrie was extremely helpful and overall good in helping our plan come to life overall i would recommend nonns to someone else who is looking for help with a ktichen design|they food is good but it was the small details that could have made the place great for example my jamon serrano could have been better had it actually been serrano ham and not simply a thick cut of aged prosciutto also the roasted peppers and anchovies were good but could have been better had they not both been canned again the food was good but i expected more for the prices and the hype around the restaurant|not to bad couple things i could point out but all around decent place to eat like a dennys|fries and burger were average nothing special and flashy just typical diner food service was nice and the place had a lot of people there so obviously people like their food |they need to take some lessons from chik fil a right next door on how to keep things moving through a drive thru at peak times this was one of the longest waits in a drive thru ive ever had im starving come on at least they got my order right|one of the only places so far that i have waited over  minutes outside and inside in the winter to eat at i guess the wait is worth it to try something different i think it goes with the hype and the atmosphere the food is good i would go back and recommend trying it at least once|the food is good the service is satisfactory but the waiter could have been more personable in my opinion the garlic naan i recommend and the chicken tikka masala is very good w the basmati rice|i have to agree with a lot of the reviews  most of what emilianos has to offer is unremarkable  however  the service is very fast and very friendly the chips and salsa are free  and tableside guac is at least fresh and cheaper than whatever godawful price avocados are selling for these days and if you remember that this is texmex not authentic mexican food go to reynas in the strip then you will find a decent inexpensive lunch or dinnerim happy with my experiences at emilianos and typically make it my goto option for lunch when im at the southside works|let me preface this by saying that im as much of a fan of reis corporate culture as i am of their products sometimes i feel the prices are unnecessarily high however i can also say that there are some products that i just wouldnt buy anywhere else i particularly love the selection of beachhiking hats camping gear and shoessandals the sales staff are always very friendly and knowledgeable also i suggest joining the member program as the dollars you spend are directly related to the amount of dividends you get back ive heard good things about their bicycle repair department but have never used the service and one of these days id love to let my son try the climbing wall|great wings i had the hot garlic ones the fries were kind of greasy and soggy or i would have given this a five star pretty chill place to watch the game|ambiance  too noisy and loud crowd sitting next to uslike really loudof course this is not restaurants faultbut its a part of our experiencefood  the food was goodbut i wont say that it was out of the world for that price in pittsburgh the food should be memorable it was  of us and everyone liked the foodservice  the service was decent and quicki may not prefer to go again because of limited food options and nothing on the menu that i would not get anywhere and may be at a better pricebut most importantlythey did not have anything to surprise and keep me coming|i like this place ive had a dress and some shirts cleaned here they took a stain out of a silk tile that another dry cleaning place could not remove after  or  tries my only issue is that whenever i am there the attendant is either on the phone and i have to wait to be waited on or i am stuck between a speaker phone conversation with the attendant and whoever is talking and myself despite the lack of customer focus they do a good job removing some tough stains|two lunch items a goat curry and a jerk chicken the former was fairly straightforward the latter had a distinctive flavor different than other jerk recipes its not too hot for those unacquainted with caribbean food to try id definitely order it again id recommend it more for dinner than lunch the husband and wife combo who run the place are very nice|we went to the la hacienda prior to seeing the christmas lights at the princess we ordered appetizers and glad we all  ordered our own since each appetizer was extremely small  of us ordered the quesadilla con carne asada it was tasty but did not look like a  quesadilla but rather like very small tacos my husband got the queso fundido which not traditional either but came in a iron pan of melted cheese  with flour tortilla on the side everyone liked what they had everything was very tasty so no complaints there and good service the margaritas were very good and nice size butthe bill for  very small appetizers and  drinks was  ive been to plenty of mexican restaurants that are just as good for a fraction of the price i guess you are paying to be at the resort|i am a local so going to a tourist spot did not really excite me but i was pleasantly surprised it is expensive compared to many local mexican places but the ambience cannot be beat we had the guacamole and homemade chips the guac is prepared at the table and was delicious  for this as an appetizer and there was more than enough for  of us i had the steak fajitas and they were tasty but the  price tag will prevent me from going back the tourists do not mind paying this the appetizers like the quesadilla is good and i would order that and a sale next time i went a week ago and the property is decorated for christmas it is beautiful today the usa today named it one of the ten best decorated hotels in the usa this is a nice treat but that is it i will stay with my favorite nandos valet parking only and ohif you want to self park at this time of year it is ready|pretty good place overall food was good but portions are quite small for the cost the appearance of the place is nice and the service was good especially the complementary vary parking|my nails came out amazing they took time to make the shape i wanted even though im super picky they still gave great service will be back soon no wait time even without appointment clean environment|the cosmopolitan is one of the higher end chic styled casinos on the strip its part of the aria buildings table minimums are high as well as anything else you would do here customer service is professional and courteous the place is very clean however i found myself at times getting lost and finding directions is more difficult than other casinos in my opinion but even with all that said its very hard not to like this place there really is little to complain about overall the cosmopolitan is one of the nicer casinos on the strip it may not have the aura and awe of some other prestige casinos but it is still worth visiting|the drive through pharmacy takes too long cars just sit if its not a quick drop off or pick up and there is any issues or questions then they should tell the customer to come inside the way it is now defeats the purpose of the drive through|my girlfriend and i did this on  in order to receive gifts this is a guide for how to survive the presentation and sales pressure and negotiate the best dealwhat we got  tickets absinthe value  each  tickets high roller at linq value  each total value about  how we were offered stayed at linq we were approached by a lady who offered us free tickets to events we told them we wanted to see absinthe and that we also wanted to go on high roller they told us we could get two tickets for both events if we went and saw a presentation and let a sales person talk to us what we did to get out of there fastsome of these ideas i got from research i did on google so it is not all original but it worked for me your agreement specifies how much time you signed up for our agreement said  minutes so if they give you an agreement that says you are signing for more than  minutes dont accept it unless your rewards package is bigger than oursbe exceedingly clear with the salesperson that you are not willing to stay beyond the  minutes allotted if you wish to be generous which we did you can offer to stay  minutes starting at the time the presentation begins but the lower the time you agree to the more bargaining power you have their goal is to keep you there for  hours dont give them too much wiggle room clarify with the salesperson and the staff what gifts you will receive and that gifts are not conditional on making any purchase give the salesperson periodic updates on how much time is left from the budget in our case  minutes give them  minute warnings  minute warnings when your time is up stand up and tell them that you would like to conclude the meeting  tell the salesperson from the beginning that you will be courteous to them and expect the same treatment assure them that they will have your full and undivided attention for the time allotted  about saying no dont be afraid to say no they are asking you to put down k based on a  hour conversation tell them that you need to do more research and ask for a card but be  firm that you will not make the sale today  dont be rude to the salesperson unless they are rude to you their job is probably hell treat them like a human being but be firm with them the most important tip is set your expectations with regards to time hopefully this is helpful and thank you to the original tripadvisor post that helped me navigate the interviewi am giving it stars because i got a good deal with regards to time invested and our representative cindy was a kind person yes there was high pressure but this is expected cindy was always professional and courteousfinally  i am going to leave it up to you guys to decide if the product is for you just do your research beforehand  now you know how to make it out of the interview and get your giftsdaniel|i dont shop here frequently but i had a good experience today  while checking out the cashier asked if i found everything i was looking for  i hadnt so i told her i was looking for a cheese slicer and i couldnt seem to find one  the staff took their time to take me over and look for one  they didnt have what i was looking for but i appreciated the effort|this place is by the house and ive driven by it  times so we finally decided to try it pros family owned shop with good service decent prices cons pizza was good but not great like grimaldis the crust was light and airy but lacked flavor toppings were good i really wanted to love this place but ill try it again and see if its better next time will be back|food is decent but customer service from the girl that works the cashier is horrible everytime i go in there she is rude and looks pissed off i noticed a difference in how she greets and interacts with others depending on race andor gender she charged me a fee to swipe my debit card also which i dont ever remember having to do before though its probably the cleanliness out of all locations i try to avoid coming to this location solely because of service|ordered the samurai pad tievegetable tempuraand yellow curry  all three are very good  this is a solid place  if we lived in the delivery area we would order food often|for decembers international supper club we headed off to caribbean spice to give them a tryits a small place with a simple menu on the wall but we were a party of  and there still was plenty of seating room for othersafter checking out the menu i went with a small jerk chicken it came with beans  rice cabbage  carrots  thigh and drumstick the flavoring of the jerk chicken was amazing perfectly blended spices the only complaint i could have is that there wasnt enough chicken to enjoy all those flavors the thigh and drumstick where are on the tiny side the rice and beans where plain in flavor but cooked perfectly and the sauted cabbage and carrots lacked in flavor as well the jerk chicken was the star of that plateservice was friendly and good im going to have to come back and try them for lunch|aok is a good description for black medicine the place looks really nice has a nice atmosphere good staff and lots of seating these are all positives however ive been disappointed by the drinks ive bought on all occasions the eternal problem that i experience at cafs in edinburgh the hot chocolate tends to be lukewarm its just not good enough coffees are fine nothing special portion sizes are quite small compared to other cafs in the areathere is a nice selection of sweet things and treats so i do recommend trying these overall this is somewhere you should try for yourself and decide whether you like it i probably wont be rushing back again|went here to propose to my gf  this is a classy lounge place where cocktails are around  a pop  however happy hour makes it worthwhile since they are  and they have ladies night on wednesday afair  our waitress was attentive and friendly and the cocktails were strong  and of course the view of vegas was awesome to see  my humble advice is to go during happy hour since its hard to beat sipping on a  cocktail averaged price whilst you look out at vegas at night|dw bistro i always have a great time when i come i have always wanted to do their sunday brunch so that is in the makingthe wait time is always reasonable and they are very apologetic but who can blame them dw is the best their drinks and bar tenders are delightful and i am not lying when i say everything on their menu is fantastic my favorite is their jerk chicken and their turkey burger always quality great prices and phenomenal food their chopped salad is also so amazing its like deconstructed with the most perfect elements and portions their drink selection however is incredible i love their mimosas and weird mixed drink varietieshowever on sundays everyone is so rude and its like a fire hazard i had called around  am to take my sister to brunch and they said no problem then i was faced with a confusing ass line then told to go to the front door where i was greeted by a super rude guy in a captain america outfit who told me they werent taking anymore guests for the next  hours why couldnt they tell me that on the phone so rude|got last minute cheap hotel from orbitz website  hotel check in line was super long wait time was  minutes   the room is simple spacious and clean  there was no coffee maker unless you are a diamond member  our neighbor blast music all night and we could hear everything on the other side  for some odd reason there were  many questionable looking guests staying at this hotel this week  so glad we are staying only for  night|cool atmosphere  i really enjoyed the music they played and the bartenders were friendly|love the food the noodles are great but i feel strange coming in and eating here because we are not asian we get treated differently and im sure that happens many places and cultures are different so it might seem a lil strange when someone else from a different ethnic group comes in the time we came in to eat we waited and sat down first a group of asian guys came in after us and were greeted and served small dishes before the meal they were more helpful with them than us we got water and then they left us alone till they brought out our food after we sat there eating everyone was just staring and i got very uncomfortable so i told my husband lets go i probably will not dine in here again but the food was great so maybe to go is easier for non asian people|i came for christmas lunch with a bunch of guys from work to the roseleaf its quite a charming little place somewhere in between and old man pub and a quaint tea shop i could imagine coming here for afternoon tea with my mum but equally some food and ale with a friend and of course the sell cocktails in teapots the overall vibe here is a bit less hipster though and a bit more bakeoff we had a threecourse lunch which priced at  a head seemed pretty reasonable i had a celeraic soup with walnuts the traditional christmas turkey as main course and christmas pudding the descriptions on the menu made it sound like it might be quite refined cooking but thankfully it was good hearty homemade food the portions were substantial something that was welcome amongst our group it wasnt super refined cooking but it was good it was served on retro china plates and the whole experience felt like you were going to your grans house and she just served you a big satisfying plate of christmas dinner its hard not to smile at that id definitely be up trying brunch here or a meal when i want a good honest feedthey also have a selection of retro games at the back michael jackson top trumps anyone|surf n turf and hory fook are awesome pokmon roll was really bad you dont want to catch em all|great place to sit back and have a desert with friends the staff is incredibly friendly and the menu will have something to please anyone while their speciality is chocolate based deserts they also have savoury crepes if youre looking for more of a meal than a desertin my opinion the best value is the crepes the fondue is also a good choice for sharinggive juliette  chocolat a try it will likely become one of your favourites|always liked the spaghetti and marinara sauce havent tried the pizza yet but overall it seemed like a nicely run place food was very good friendly staff kinda in the middle of all the business plaza but nice and quiet|will be back to this local cantonese traditional fav opens pm to am great foods and tons great special low price items we will be back for big dinner|this place was so yummy loved the jalapeno poppers with shrimp  the oysters i ordered the coconut shrimp cocktail but it was kind of bland had to add a ton of hot sauce to get flavor they give you all of the coconut tho including the shaved coconut inside  coconut milk place is pricey tho|i like this place  its not fancy or exotic but their burritos are satisfying and tasty  they also have a selection of mexican i assume sodas which is a nice touch|we visited francescas al lago on a cold wisconsin friday night im not a big pasta eater so i dont usually think of italian food but we wanted someplace close and it had opening on opentable so we decided to try it im so glad we didwe were seated promptly there were a number of patronsbut it was not crowded by any means its a nice airy and open environment they have a number of prints on the walls but they had put holiday ribbons on each of them which i did find vaguely puzzling im all for decorating for christmas but it made it impossible to see the printswe were served water and bread with parmesan immediately theres olive oil at the table to mix it with our waiter arrived shortly to take our drink order and help with menu items im a carpaccio fan so we ordered that and our drinks while we perused the menuby the time we had decided what we wanted for entrees the carpaccio had already arrived that was a theme here incredibly fast service in addition to the waiters there were runners who were bringing out your food and refilling the water and bread as soon as it was empty i was impressed i was also impressed by the carpaccio thinly sliced raw sirloin with hearts of palm celery capers tomatoes mushrooms cheese shavings lemon  olive oil this may have been the best carpaccio i have ever had not only was it delicious but i also felt there was a great portion for the price francescas has a different special each evening and on friday it was the fishfry i loved it whitefish calamari shrimp and scallops all deep fat fried and served with frenchfries the fries were crispy and thin just the way i like them they could have used a little more seasoning but were still very good the dish came with a tiny bowl of coleslaw im not a fan of mayonnaise so i generally dont enjoy coleslaw but this was vinegar based and was again the best coleslaw ive ever had i just wish there had been more of it one thing i did find disconcerting was the presentation of this dish it was served on a flatpaddle that would be fine except the fries kept falling off the sides still i was very pleased i thought the flavors and textures were all amazing and again it felt like a very reasonable price my dining companion had gnocchi which was also very goodthe service and the food both surpassed my expectations i was very pleased with francescas i cant wait to try it again|the biggest pupusas ive ever seen great flavors and loads of cheese plenty of cabbage just wish they had a salsa besides the traditional vinegar sauce the menu is huge only other thing i tried were the plantain empenadas which were sweet and delicious  awesome location as well|after lunch we couldnt help ourselves and had to go to cupcrazed cakery in baxter village they were on one of my favorite shows from the foodnetwork cupcake wars and they won the shop was so cute if i were to ever open a bakery id definitely do something like thiswe chose the coconut macaroon cupcake gluten free creme brle and vanilla we also tried a chocolate cake pop and a peanut butter cookie cup filled with chocolate fudge ganache it was a sugary afternoon but definitely worth itlater that night wei tried the coconut macaroon cupcake and holy moly the frosting the cake the coconut the filling all of it was amazing it didnt last longweve also had their triple salted caramel cupcake which was good but a bit too salty the key lime pie was perfect and their frosting has the best consistency and sweetness if you are gluten free they have some pretty darn good gf cupcakesthe atmosphere is adorable they have fun and colorful furniture and its great for friends|my review on this place is based only on the food  the food is ok just ok needs more flavor and more heat thats what im looking in a texmex restaurant or mexican restaurant or cantina  but service is great  beer is great  place super clean |it was good but not the way i expected i had carne asada fries from cali and they were amazing like out of the world amazing the meat was good it tasted like it was made by ecuadorians i say that because ive had that taste before im half ecuadorian and puerto rican its not bad just not what i wantedit had a little sweet taste to it tooservice was good location is good the horchata was delicious overall it was good like i saidnot what i thought it would be the again it cali so yeaheither way still very good|this place is pretty good i had the beef pad thai and it was ok not a lot of flavor but i loved the peanuts they put on it i also got the wonton soup probably by far my favorite wonton soup ive had if they could add some flavor to the pad thai i would change my rating ill be back to try it again maybe to add some peanut sauce to it|i love the idea with a public market in pittsburgh but most other cities that have a public market have decades of experience reputation notorietythe ambiance of the new market circa  when it was at smallman street was remarkable the vendors were packed the place pulsated with life and it was difficult to make a path along the walkway a lot of the time its current location on penn avenue couldnt be more different its out of the way from the strips main drag and is often deserted sadly ive visited a few times on a saturday and half of the vendors dont even bother setting up as another yelper described tumbleweedssupporting local business is important to me but it seems like the location and the bleak ambiance isnt helping any of the vendors there theres talk of a second public market move in the last two or three years  i hope its for the better|was in vegas for the weekend from san diego and saw this place after looking through groupon  for  worth of food originally from maryland so i know my blue crabscrab cakes this place is as good as it gets for a taste of the chesapeake bay im so glad we stopped in for lunch before our flight back and even ordered an extra crab cake sandwich to take with me since i cant get blue crab cakes yes it matters what kind of crab it is in socal aj greeted us immediately upon entry he was super friendly and knew we were in a hurry so helped us out with suggestions even though i knew what i was getting my gf and i split a crab pretzel so good i almost didnt have room for my crab cake after but i managed to power through even the fresh made potato chips seasoned with crab spice were on point i would have loved to had time to pick a few steamed blue crabs but just wasnt able to prices were a little steep but where else can you get fresh east coast seafood it was worth every penny the decor was totally maryland which i loved i knocked a star off because they support the ravens boooo go redskins and because they had a south carolina seasoning on the tables instead of old bay bad form crab corner but aj did provide me with a can of the ob upon request so not a total bust this will definitely be getting a return visit whenever im back in vegas nice little taste of home before xmas to remind me of my family thanks aj and crab corner go terps httr go os caps|lots of gluten free options even battered fish tacos  noteworthy central american christiancatholic decor including votive candles crucifixes and wrought iron accents black bean soup was as i remember the flavor tasted in guatemala dont miss the white sangria|the food is decent the service is decent they are very kind and outgoing but they mess up a lot they always fix it very apologetically but they mess up more often than not here the margaritas are on point strong and flavorful the chips and salsa are so yummy and cant beat the free price with yelp check in also the flan is delicious im a fan of the big daddy burrito as well as the fiesta nachos|ordered min to closing and guy on the line was very polite even delivered to the cibola vista resort where we were staying and even knew to ask for what building we were atpizza was great glad i made the decision over dominos and pizza hut dough tasted fresh and ingredients were awesome i didnt have menu in front of me and person the phone recommended mega meat because i asked for something meaty|i  usually come here about every few weeks for a dozen bagels when i came this morning this lady with blonde hair and glasses was rudei was pretty loud and clear when i was picking out my bagels she kept saying i cant here you she never offered us napkins or freezer bags i  guess i wont be coming right even they open there is this one older lady thats really sweet ill be coming in when shes there on top of everything else she kept on rushing me there was no one in there and i was the only customer|casual atmosphere tasty drinks and really good burgers i dont eat red meat and they had lots of good options for veggie chicken and fish burgers i went with their vegan burger which i thought was really good my fianc had a burger that had a hamburger patty and a steak i firm remember what they called it and he loved it the fries were also really tasty if youre in the cosmopolitan its a great option|eating here now with my girlfriend for the first time the food and service was good but the choice of music is not appropriate foul language and the n word used excessively this is a mexican place and you are playing inappropriate getto music i dont think we will be returning just because i can not bring girlfriend and esp my family back so sad because the food was good|we were i vows by one of the club promoters for our friends bachelorette party for an open bar hour and decided to stay afterwards to soak up the atmosphere and dance a bit because come on who says no to free drinks our promoter was extremely nice and more then a gentlemen the only problem we had was that the strobe lights came on at about midnight and i kid you not you couldnt keep your eyes open they were so bright and sporadic i would go back again to check out the day club scene because the outdoor area is beautiful but i dont see myself going back at night|one of the best coffee shops in charlotte the wait can be a little long but it is worth it the staff are always cheerful they care about their coffee and do a very good job at it the location is very good of the light rail which is very handy in the th street market with other brilliant vendors and so close to uptown njc makes their own syrups and vanilla sugar which is impressive they use counter culture coffee which is top notch my favorite drink is a latte the crema on the espresso is good and the milk is velvety smooth and has fine bubbles it is excellent the latte art on top is impressive too|trying to find great fresh fish in scottsdale is like trying to find a snowball in scottsdale in august and eddie vs didnt disappointment my expectations nor my dates it was just okay not anywhere near a great piece of fish the drinks were fine and the bar scene lively hence why a  star and not a  i give up trying to find great sea food in scottsdaleonly gianfrancos fish is the best|i love this place i give it  stars i used to go to ichiza back in the days but it just went downhill and i was waiting for a decent japanese tapas place i totally forgot about this place and im glad i went again we ordered tuna tataki it wasnt great nor was it bad can i pass on this the next time i come here i sure can the garlic squid was an omg moment for me  the squid was melt in your mouth and the garlic sauce was delicious the asparagus was good with the squid perfect combo it was so good i had to order another one  word of advise save the garlic sauce so you can dip it with other stuff hehe we also ordered the asparagus pork it looked great but i didnt try it but at least i took a picture of it the cajun chicken was okay it didnt distinguish from any other popcorn chicken i have had in other places i thought it lacked a bit of seasoning but what makes it cajun is the sauce the sauce wasnt a deal breaker either we also ordered the soft shell crab its soft shell crab that you can get in most japanese restaurants it was good fried crab mmm jalapeo poppers were delicious not spicy at all and it has bacon bits on it again great but not awesome we ordered a variety of skewers which didnt disappoint we ordered gizzard pork cheek pork brisket and chicken wings least favorite was the chicken wings on the skewer not much meat on it  we also ordered the takoyaki its wheat flour ball with octopus nom nom be careful when you bite into it its piping hot and you really dont want to explain to other people that your mouth got burned by giant scorching balls lol we also ordered the ikura and salmon bowl and mini udon both were good and the udon broth was good after eating all that food it makes your tummy nice and warm but wait what better way to top an evening off ice cream so we ordered the maccha waffle with vanilla ice cream im not sure where i made room for this but it was delicious it reminded me of honey toast except honey toast on crack lol highly recommend to get this i cant wait to come back and whats better they are open late|steel cut oatmeal is really good for breakfast and if u r staying at luxor its the closest healthy breakfast u can findeggs are  each  i had two sunside up to compliment the oatmeal one downnote  every time ive gone their for breakfast the wait for food is really long|love this place  always fresh and delish  the lunch sandwiches are pretty tasty too  only caution would be to not buy the popcorn they sell in the shop from a vendor  the bag was small  crazy expensive probably organic or whatever  and only a few kernels popped  we have popcorn for dinner at least once a week so we were extremely disappointed with this batch  had to pull of the faithful oriville kernels to get full|weve been coming to this restaurant since they opened at this location the food is excellent and ambiance at night is good weve never been disappointed with any dish however the last few times we have been very disappointed with the service we like to dine and not have servings come out too quickly thats not the issue the problem is the staff was extremely inattentive we waited a long time to be asked for our drink order same with getting our drinks same with the food order and delivery to top that off the dirty dishes just sat on our table a very long time the kicker was they werent that busy the first time i just chalked it up to a bad night but its happened  more times joe is a very hands on owner please be more east coast with service|not a lot of options for vegetariansi understand it may be obvious given the name of the restaurant but i always like to have optionswe were able to get a table for two here on a busy saturday night they are near the theater district so that was a big plus they have a back room that has additional seating that we were placed on not impressed that they first seated is on the table closest to the door that the waiter would have to pass close by every time and though there were plenty of other free tables we had to ask to be moved back room is also smoky from the kitchenas a vegetarian i had the grilled bread delicious with yummy butter with sea salt and the brussel sprouts shredded to unrecognizable and very saltyoverall not a very memorable dinner for the price will not be returning|i really like this place and i come here regularly since i work downtown  the food is very good and the sushi is very fresh at one time the man i presumed to be the owner recognized me each time i visited lately i havent seen him and something is off today they were busy and the staff was really hustling  there were  cooks and the sushi chef and the cashier the cashier was really working hard but couldnt keep up with the dirty tables  when my dish was ready there was nowhere to sit at a clean table the staff is working hard this is a management issue i hope they pull it together|came here to watch a friends band the venue was pretty good and the staff wasnt bad they ran out of meat for the nachos at like pm and didnt tell me until it came out the beer selection was good and reasonably priced the nachos were super cheap tasting and i wouldnt recommend them on the other hand i tried a friends burger and friea and those were both quite good the sett looks nice and is super relaxed i wouldnt seek it out but i wont have any complaints coming here in the future for events|ratings based on  primary aspects food ambience and servicefood is not exceptionalits good italian food made with fresh ingedientsif its just for food i will give a  i ordered the restaurant week special  course meal and my wife ordered from the menu zucchiniambiancevery small place and everyone is loudso not good or badit is what it isi like thatmy wife doesnt that muchservicenow here is where i believe things make a lot of differencewhen serving dessertthey replaced the item on the prefixed menu with something else and didnt bother to tell us in advancethey assumed that we wont noticewhen we asked the server apologized and told us that how chef wants itwe didnt create a fuss about itbut selling by cheating your customer wont take you anywherewill avoidil burloni is a much better italian place in the same vicinity|im never a huge fan of casinos  probably because i dont gamble and find them to be a waste of time  however my grandma loves them  and she was visiting so i took her to hochunkbut i must say that this was a decent place  smoke free  although yes you can still smell the smoke in the carpet  and not too big that you get lost  i wouldnt come here on my own but would take my grandma again|i come to russos regularly for lunch and mostly order the lunch special w meatball  jalapeo i love the atmosphere and friendly customer service it makes the experience even bettertheir pizza is the best pizza i have had so far the crust is nice and golden brown most of the time sometimes it is a little burnt and they put the right amount of sauce cheese and they give you a pretty good amount of toppings i love it their slices are huge a couple of times i got a medium to small sized pizza one slice was the equivalent of two pieces of pizza i was so happy when i saw the size of their pizzai highly recommend their pizzaother then the pizza their other menu items are pretty average havent tried everything i enjoyed their ceaser salad the grilled chicken had that smokey taste it was deliciousoverall im a russos pizza fan im seriously addicted out of  in my book|it was a good show not what i expected some tricks were pretty amazing like shadow tricks and the teleportation tricks were pretty nice and i appreciate the technical difficulty behind such tricks jan rouven was funny and entertaining and even though you could tell the crowd was not very energetic he dealed with it and was still able to put on a fun interesting showabout half the time was dancing which you kind of expect because they have to set up the illusions the dancers were really talented and it was as interesting as the illusions show i just wished there was more magic and illusionsshow was around an hour and a half and was located at tropicana casino and resort we got the tickets on the day of for about  and it was near the middlefront of the auditorium|after a long day of work i decided take my family out for dinner we decided to visit this location because even though there is a bjs closer to my home this location offers better service our servers name was heather and she ensured we received quality customer service the restaurant was clean and our food was delivered promptly i will continue to choose this location over summerlins as long as i continue to received outstanding customer service|they have really good comfort food here the inside is a little dark and off putting when you enter the fish stew and fried chicken and both winners|un chouette caf mais sans plus lendroit est sympathique mais il y a peu de places de plus si on peut rest aussi longtemps que lon vit pour bouquiner ou bosser il ne faut pas compter sur la connexion internet plus que vacillante les cafs sont toutefois bien servi et les employs sympathiques tout comme lambiance qui y rgne|i have been to vapiano numerous times for dinner and enjoy the food tremendously  it is fast food style  you order at the counter  with quality food   of the time the cooks are exceptional with a bad apple once in a while hence four out of five stars i highly recommend stopping by|ive been coming here for a year or two mostly for car washes and the occasional smog check im not sure if its because of my car but the guys who work here do an amazing job you get a great value for the price paid i fall in love with my car again every time i leave here many thanks|i stopped in after taking a final exam for their buy  tacos get  free hooked deali got a carne asada a pastor and a chorizo taco out of all these i would say the pastor was the best the steak was decent but not as flavorful as the pastor and the chorizo was tasty but in my opinion very very salty and greasyi make my own guacamole at home but ran out of chips so i tried to order an extra side of chips at maize i thought the cashier understood what i wanted but instead she gave me extra cups of salsa and i didnt realize it until i got home oopsthe tacos were still pretty good and id say maize is still one of the best spots for mexican food at uiuc|lovely place thats close tasty and reasonably priced  not to mention how easy it is to order off the yelp app|very friendly and professional an upfront estimate would have been beneficial and a thorough inspection of the product prior to installation would have helped|good food we were driving through madison and i was craving middle eastern food trusting my fellow yelpers we headed to banzo i had the falafel platter and loved it the hummus was outstanding so was the fried eggplant really outstanding i was a little disappointed with the rice though it was a little dry but overall a good platter my son ordered the f bomb and enjoyed his pita sandwich my husband got the beef in pita and i am not sure if he enjoyed it as much as i thought or if he was humoring me and my falafel craviing anyway it was a good place to stop lucky madison but the restaurant was underheated and cold i get it that banzo was built on food trucks but people who are coming to dine in want a little more comfort|i just had my  escape in for an oil change and tire rotation vicki raines was my service associate and was pleasant helpful informative and handled everything in a timely manner two days later the low tire pressure warning came on so i returned thinking maybe something was not completed from the tire rotation but it was a screw in the tire i arrived at  pm  almost closing but rulon beazer took it right back and had it fixed it at no charge both those advisors and experiences rate  stars i took one star off because i also am having a problem with the sync system which the other service department told me they would have to keep the car all day to look at both of those service associates were not as friendly or helpful however i am taking the car back based on the two positive service experiences so am hoping the third time will be positive|very clean good customer service great food nice family place enjoyed a nice breakfast with my mom|yummy hot dogs dont let the shady looking location steer you away from the yummyness of this food i usually dont eat hot dogs but these are the best ive had great that they are open late for a to go midnight snack|been here before and really enjoyed the food the uniscallop linguini is off the hook the squid ink pasta is also great thought japaneseitalian fusion was weird but it really works its a little pricey but well worth it i will be back |i came here on a monday  unfortunately they were out of lettuce and tomatoes so the chicken salad i ordered was a bit on the sweet side  my husband ordered the barbecue chicken wrap and enjoyed it immensely even though he is not a wrap kind of guy  the place was empty  small in a cute way  but very clean and inviting  id come again if i was in the area|for all you can eat this place is ok but expensive for the quality they have a big menu and offer a kitchen menu as wellfor all you can eat the food quality is higher than average the service was relatively quick as well and friendlier than most all you can eat sushii ordered a ramen on the side but instead of using ramen noodles they used udon which was a big disappointment if i were you i wouldnt waste my time with anything but the sushi because for the most part it is an inaccurate approximation of japanese foodall you can eat is good for groups but every time i go i am disappointed and i would strongly recommend you go to a real sushi bar rather than an all you can eat place like this you will be paying more for less food but the quality will be much much better|latereview i came here after hearing so much about it from a couple of friends and i was in the mood for mediterranean so i decided to come check them outit was such a hassle trying to find the place i even walked in to a different restaurant thanks google maps fail haha but after finding the restaurant i decided to go right ini ordered the chicken curry and a side of hummus and pita chipschicken curry   the flavor was ok i wasnt a big fan of it but i wasnt unimpressed either the flavor although ok felt like it was lacking something that extra oomph that would make me want to come back and try something else on their menu on the bright side the asian in mr enjoyed the saffron rice more than the main entree itself so ill give them that rice was fluffy and not soggy the rice was the saving grace of this dishhummus and pita chips  no matter where i go and try different forms of hummus i will always be critical because i have been spoiled by a fellow coworker and friends hummus yes i understand that tahini is part of the ingredient but i am very partial to garbanzo beans i want to taste the garbanzo and tahini working together not just straight out tahini and yes i am an avid salt user but the pita chips had to give me pause as it was a little bit too much salt for meif the craving for mediterranean hits me again this will not be the first thing that pops in to my mind but if im in the area doing errands i will definitely give them a try again|my family and i went here for the first time food was okay but it was a nice environment and awesome service would try again|great on many levelsfood qualityportion sizepricecustomer appreciation by staffim usually leary of fan favorite bbq joints as mostly they r overcooked meat smoothered under gallons of sauce  not at rollin smoke  here they present perfectly cookedsmoked meats that are moist and delicious  their homemade sauce which u can add on the side was delicious and sweetanother plus  no waitersself seating and clean upnice atmosphere inside  the only downnote is location  its located under the highway  another note of inprovement is that the bread the meal comes with under the entree should be toastedthe brisket was good i just wished they didnt chop it up  ribs best everenjoy|reliable have most of the flavors youre craving made w good ingredients  takes  to  min to make a pie but they have some ready to go for people in a hurry like me  best flavors thai chicken and bbq chicken  wish their prices werent so high but it is the airport  friendly staff|i enjoyed my meal here as well as the unique drinks i would suggest this place to anyone looking for something different and fresh ill be back|i came straight to yelp after seeing the tso this past weekend the reason i wanted to see how the recent reviews stack up is because i took some friends to tso for the first time i have seen them before and i think the show has lost some of its magic first and foremost i love tso and if you dont know that its a hard rock show in advance then you should have done more homework before going for those of you bashing the musicians  well i can tell you that you are dead wrong  you simply dont like the genre and thats blurring your opinion tso has excellent musicians and singers and they are all quite talented in their field so the last time i saw tso prior to this year was probably  years ago something is definitely off from the last time and certainly far from the first time i saw them about a decade ago part of the problem is that their most popular album was a christmas album and i think they must feel pigeonholed given the huge success for that album i havent been keeping up with tsos latest work but i can see where some people would be put off by this years show it starts off with a black sabbath vibe i swear theyre using the same pyro stage show that motley crue used during their vegas residency last year and the mood is pretty dark in fact the beginning doesnt feel christmaslike at all with the fire and weird imagery on the screen i saw the confusion on many peoples faces around me then when they do insert the wellknown christmas songs it gets better  but then they go back to a dungeons and dragons type theme and that further drives the show a little off kilter to me tso is a band that is trying to expand its horizons but their initial success is making it hard for them to stretchout and try new songs and imagery i dont think they want to keep playing the christmas stuff over and over  but unfortunately thats what most people expect i agree with some of the other reviews that the whole storytelling aspect has become cheesy not sure what the solution is but i get the negative reviews for sure personally i love hard rock and the stage show is pretty damn impressive but i also love christmas and would prefer the show from  years ago than what i witnessed this past weekend|yummmmmmm dishcity and dimsum are among the two most awesome dim sum houses in las vegas dont miss the dim sum cart experience pm everyday kj dim sum at rio and amazing ping pang pong at gold coast casino across the street are the bomb|we came for dinner went to the bar while waiting for our table and enjoyed the bar so much we canceled the table  the vibe at this place is awesome great music fun decor friendly staff good food started with the butcher block which was very good i had the tomato soup and it was amazing hubs had the potato soup and liked it too we split the nine iron panini and it was just okay servers brought us someone elses food three times which became a little tiring  overall we really liked this place|this place was incredibly busy that is my disclaimer we sat in the bar area but were quickly told to move from one side of the room to the other if we wanted the full menu thats fair a lot of restaurants are like that we moved seating ourselves at a table within the area she described then we waited and waited some more i am a bartender myself and so i understand how hard it is to be under staffed for the number of customers but we didnt see anyone for  minutes right at the point that we were going to find another place to eat a frantic server approached us she impatiently hurried our drink order out of us and returned with menus it is a brewery and the beer was pretty good i got the amber it had the perfect amount of hoppiness for my taste i ordered the steak  shrimp meal shocked at seeing it only priced at  i wasnt expecting much since the initial experience and the price were not indicators of cuisine brilliance i was wrong though the steak was  ounces and cooked exactly how i asked without too much butter glaze which cheap steaks are notorious for the butterfly shrimp were delicious it was exactly what i wanted out of the meal the server continued to be too busy to serve us but it wasnt her fault it was a sunday night in vegas and they were not staffed well overall i probably wouldnt go back as there are so many incredible alternatives|my girls and i come to vegas about  times a year and we often stay at elara and book a suite we usually split the suite with about  girls total i know i know it sounds like a lot of people for one room however it brings the price down for us since we usually just come back to shower get ready and sleep theres a king sized bed l shape couch with a pull out queen bed and a small sofa bed besides this theres also a kitchen equipped with dishes utensils a stove microwave and a full sized fridge perfect for pregaming and bringing food back we never have to worry about keeping our food fresh or our drinks here its so convenient as for the bathrooms theres one jacuzzi hot tub which we hardly use but it is nice if you want to soak your feet from wearing your heels all night long theres also two sinks a shower and a toilet the best part is the lighting though the bathroom lighting is great for all the girls who want to take selfies and get ready its the absolute perfect lighting too add to the convenience downstairs is the miracle mile shops which means theres plenty of food to eat and shops for you to pick up any items you forgot they also have earls sandwiches open  hours so you never have to worry about starving you can walk right downstairs and get food any time of the day|youll like the tacos if youre drunkotherwise theyre just alright|we decided to take the drive down to this restaurant on sunday afternoon i was very impressed  the front entrance was a bit cluttered near the registers and the drink area the general manager was up front assisting guests and welcoming them   i started my meal with a delicious salad everything tasted real fresh  next i moved on to the grill you can order as many steaks as you want they cook them to order  the mashed potatoes were delicious but tasted a bit cold  i wanted ham to be cut off the bone for me but there was nobody in the front counter the roast chicken was delicious  service was good too  i was constantly given free refills and old plates were taken off my table  the dessert bar had so many choices  we really had a good time here and will definitely return  we even purchased a take out box and filled it with all sorts of goodies|this place always treats me well im not too happy with the brand of batteries they sell interstate it failed at  months and of course the replacement warranty is only for  months  the manager worked worth me a bit though on the replacement battery but it still set me back  unfortunately they only carey interstate batteries and the nicer ones interstate makes  i come here for all of my automotive needs and this is the first time things have not worked out well the workers and manager go the extra mile to take care of their customers my desire would be to never purchase another interstate battery in the future|i love papa murhpys pizza i have been eating papa murphys  times a month for the last  years i like most of the staff there but several times i go to use a coupon and its expired and this one lady wont accept it  even though they always have the same coupons all the time its a little frustrating because the other locations on cactus and union hills always take them even if they are expired|the chocolate souffle crepe is excellent and unforgettable but for  its slightly pricey the coconut and oreo gelato is creamy at  each scoop great and cheery service  experience it seems to have a q all the time|ive been here for lunch a few times so far i love the atmosphere of this place very chic they have different menus depending on the time of day so expect a slightly fancier menu if you come here for dinner the lunch menu is less expensive  and includes a variety of mostly sandwiches off of the lunch menu ive had the chicken honey mustard wrap and the ruben they were out of rye bread so i got white they were ok nothing to rave about i would probably try something different next time some people with me ordered burgers and they looked awesome for sides i got fries the fries were actually pretty good tasted fresh cut which i love ive also had the tomato soup and it was served with a goat cheese filled crouton which was an awesome touch but the soup was served cold not sure if it was sitting out long or was suppose to be chilled   the true reason why im giving this a  star is because of the service every time ive been here the service has been very slow not refilling our water glasses forgetting silverware or taking ages for our food to come i dont mind waiting but when i order a basic burger or sandwich i expect it to not take longer than  minutes|food was great service was a bit slow considering they werent that busy and they were fully staffed they need a better bar selection the restaurant was clean|overpriced but exactly what i needed its really a hangover cure haven i had never heard of such a place they had advertised nausea  medication but did not provide it  i got the works and it was suppose to include more than i got the concept was new to me and the staff was friendly|i live in sun city grand so this is a convenient spot  prices are reasonable and ive never had a bad meal as some others have described  just returned from a birthday dinner therewe were a table of   were seated promptly received menus and had our drink order taken  the server followed up promptly and answered a few questions about how items were prepared  what was included with different entrees  meals arrived quickly enough and food was hot but not scaldingnot left under heating lamps but served promptly  bread butter water were all refilled as needed  the server was there but not intrusive  the place was packed when we arrived but thats to be expected the week of christmas  everyone seemed to be having a good time and enjoying themselves  we  were happy with the evening   different entrees|nice staff food is only average burgers are safe bet and wings are good but small the bar is well stocked and trivia night is fun|this place is one of the best ranges in vegas like all places though it has pros and conspros the biggest gun selection in vegas i have lived here for almost a decade and have gone to almost every range in town by far none even come close this place also has a lot of exotic weapons such as barrett light   per shot but so worth it ma deuce  cal machine gun   a little less worth it but still cool and of course the mini gun   but totally worth it cons weapon maintenance is lacking which is surprising for a place run by vets many weapons visibly havent been cleaned in weeks and some are in such bad shape that they jam every other shot another con is the customer experience the place exploded in popularity over the last few years and unfortunate byproduct of that is that the overall attitude of the rsos range safety officers seems to be increasingly hurry up and shoot so we can get the next group in also  most rsos are nice but there are a few that are extremely conceited and treat anybody whos not an ex spec op as an incompetent buffoon that gets annoying last con is the price unless you are willing to drop  and get a large package the experience will last just a few minutes best value is actually picking and choosing individual weapons you end up spending about the same  but get to shoot what you want and can get double ammooverall the place is a lot of fun come in with the right expectations and a lot of cash and you wont be disappointed dont forget to request a hmmwv humvee pickup especially when it is not excessively hot outside the ride really adds to the experience|this is the best airport restaurant ive ever been to the food service and ambience allow you to forget where you are which when in an airport during the holidays is nothing short of a miracle i had fruit with greek yogurt and granola it is served deconstructed and everything was fresh and in season it was actually a healthy breakfast with flavor in an airport i also ordered a side of bacon which was clearly made to order it was hot crisp yet tender and melted in my mouth the coffee is excellent too they brew it by the cup so your refills are always fresh my server was friendly and knowledgeable the next time i am at clt i will definitely stop here|got a tritip steak and unlimited salad bar the steak was ok it was somewhat overcooked ordered medium rare but the seasoning was quite good  the flavor was there but not quite cooked to my liking steak aside the service was phenomenal our server was on point visiting us whenever she saw a low drink or an empty plate on the table the salad bar was also quite good probably my favorite part there were tons of options wings tacos pretty much any vegetable and the ranch was damn good i think next time ill just go for the salad bar at  all you can eat you cant beat that|restaurant trs achaland par des locaux sandwich normes et grand choix de breakfast lunch  tomato soup excellente burger vege dlicieux grill cheese soso car beaucoup de pain versus la garniture de fromage  ambiance cool et trs sympa  pas de freemont street|bleeh|i recommend coming here for breakfast or lunch because the line for dinner is a nightmare  hours but if you are going for dinner you make a reservation at the front and they call you about an hour later to come in  not to get seated but to wait in the actual line which is another hour or so if you are a hangry person this aint your place i can understand the hype of this place since it has literally every type of cuisine you can think of but only a few are actually tasty mostly the seafood trust me when i say you can forego a lot of the meals here remember we cant spare to waste any stomach space on mediocre food especially on a  buffet ya gotta get your moneys worth and get the good quality onesthe following foods are from the holiday season brunchgetpokelobster worth the hype get them boiledseaweed saladtofushrimp has this good curry flavorseafood paellasteak and eggsgreen tea gelatofreshly squeezed orange juiceyou can skip out onsushidimsum pancakespastriescookieslobster bisquetruffle scallop potatoi probably wont come back here but glad i checked this off my buffet list also my sister said wicked spoon is better so im going to go there on my next vegas trip|i think this buffet is overrated came here during edc weekend and it was  per person it was not worth the price anyhow i think wicked spoon is probably worth more bang for your buck |i come here often for lunch the food is very good but the girls who work the cash register seem rude and like theyre always in bad moods when i go which makes me feel awkward their hummus is great and if you order a kabob plate its a lot of food which is nice|i always enjoy the meals here and the service is good the location for this place is off the beaten path but they seem to keep the place going regardless|i previously wrote a less than stellar review but am very impressed by how my purchase ended  after an unfriendly first experience i decided to give see another shot  lauren who helped me was a doll and i got a very genuine apology from the gentleman who had previously offended me  i now have my new glasses and would recommend see|first of all this is my second time here and i wasnt impressed the first time  this time we went for heavy appetizers and drinks before seeing the new star wars movienow im a fan  they streamlined down the menu and upscaled the liquor selection  the bartender knew how to make a proper wet martini and she was bloody gorgeous which doesnt hurt either  the antipasti plate was full to the brim and delicious the mussels were cooked perfectly and there was a guy with a guitar playing in the bar who was great accompaniment to the meali opened aliante as a dealer back in  and it has a special place in my heart  i try to go there as often as i can and now i have a favorite watering hole there in which to drink and munchif youre going to the movies and want a great little place for a drink and food before andor after this is a good place for you|i really want to love this place but am let down every time i go there the execution just isnt there for the food there are a couple of items that are ok but not good enough to go back that often|we go to nandos frequently and i love it  their salsa is great and if you like hot ask your server for it we typically split the chicken fajitas and there is plenty for two  the patio is nice and spacious|best place on fremont to see a band  the security isnt all over everybody there was seating along the bar and side wall you can get right up to the stage the only draw back is people smoking cigarettes everywhere|compared to the houston zoolights a little disappointed it still is a beautiful showing of lights just dont expect to see many animals  i saw the camels that you can pay to ride the backs of two bald eagles and a komodo dragon much of park was roped offorder tickets online for  discount they dont have seniorstudent or aaa discount if you want to avoid all the children go later in the nightprobably a one and done kind of event good event for kids since it doesnt take a long time to see everything  i would give it three and a half stars but rounded up|stopped in for dinner after seeing a show and had the best beerbattered fish  chips i ever ate  the only reason for not giving a star review is the price was a bit too high for a fish  chips dinner regardless how awesome they were  and i was a little disappointed that they were out of stone ipa|i thought id check out gr so i came for happy hour since im not a meat eater truffle chips with garlic aioli were very good but the fries were tiny  id rather have full size fries and less of them than teenie tiny pieces  the atmosphere is friendly i like it|excellent burgers  lines are ridiculous but its worth the wait i wish they had more dessert options b the shake is yummy but i wasnt fan of the top half the pudding part overall it was worth the hype and everyone should try it at least once|i have ate a lot of burgers in my life but i have to take my hat off to mr ramsay we ate there twice while in vegas and both times the burgers were amazing the flavors are unique and the seasoning helps you remember why gordon is so good at what he does i love this placethe one star that is missing is for the poor service from our waitress she was too busy talking with one of the male waiters instead of taking care of the customer|stumbled into this verizon store on lunch break and ended up with a great deal and great service i was christmas shopping for my kids for new phones and tablets nikea greeted me as soon as i came through the door she was very helpful and made sure i was a happy customer when before i left she also had the assistance from terrence whom was very knowledgeable and informative about the promotions going on they were both great and i would return to this store for all my future needs|solid vietnamese food with some chinese options and a large veganvegetarian selection  functional atmosphere and quick friendly service  prices are okay not fantastic  worth a visit if youre in the mood for vietnamese cooking|i would have given four stars but they lost a star at the end the food was very delicious as always i had the pineapple curry with shrimp my girlfriend had the wild curry my suggestion is when ordering your heat level remember to take into account if your curry is sweet or not this effects the end result the food is good and the service was above par the only thing is when we got the remainder of the food to go they wrapped our curry and rice together in a to go bowel instead of separate this gave me a rice curry soup when i got home not a good practice in my opinion|good atmosphere and good food but its fairly run of the mill not as fantastic as everyone says it its moving away from its hole in the wall status that i prefer|update the last two times i have been here and ordered my meal to go i have unfortunately found hair in my food both times i really love the food but finding hair in your food really ruins it hummus xpress i love you but please be more careful when preparing and serving your food|very good price for an allyoucaneat meal the meat dishes have relatively good variety especially recommend for the spicy curry chicken other than that the desserts can be better but i guess for this price you cant expect too much|clean nice hotel with fast checkin and super good wifi walls are a bit thin so you might end up needing ear plugs to sleep all in all great hotel i would recommend for sure|after taking our order we waited for more than  minutes the food is fine delicious beef and pork the chicken wings are so so|ugh|the food was really good the korean flavour really stood out the beef was so tender but the pork was the best dish the sauce was what made it so great the service was not the best it was quite slow|the meat was very soft and tender all of our family members enjoyed it so much when the meat sizzled as it was cooking it sounded like music to our ears i believe this time it was the best music of all the kimchi was well flavored and i enjoyed the pickled radish overall the meat is delicious to be eaten in any way and the side dishes and salad is fresh and yummy|we ordered a meat lover set menu it is really delicious and enough food for two persons table is clean and i also liked the side menu which is really good for my taste|it was like eating a very delicious dinner the service was great and the workers there are very kind but the meat is the best although some of them might be a little too spicy it was great the side dishes were so good especially the kimchi it is well flavored our children enjoyed it and overall it was a very good and memorable meal|food was really good great ambiance seems pretty fancy hot dishes were great and we loved the tempura sushi rolls took longer to come out and werent the greatest my family has ever had but good service was not the greatest it wasnt busy but we were kept waiting several times probably wouldnt come back but it was good and might recommend to it to a friend|we went using a groupon deal so we didnt order any food the theater wasnt crowded but all the waiters were a little distracting|i love this theatre however i am trying to find times for the show sisters on  for myself and a few friends so we can all coordinate and there is no info for this date except star wars ive tried calling  numbers that arent automated as the automated only goes to  also but those phone numbers just have busy signals as though they are off the hook i need this info so my friends and i can make our necessary arrangements very frustrating  |savoy il is not the first place i think of when im searching for excellent craft beer however triptych fits the bill unique and tasty craft brews in a genuine small town environment the brewers man the bar here frequently and are happy to talk beer or anything local the beers are unique and varied with a nice selection rotating regularly there are numerous beers aging in cask in the tasting room and often  or two are tapped the tasting room has plenty of room for board games cards or just lounging and since they do not serve their own food they allow you to bring in any outside food|i used to like get go only because of the fuel perk discount but now i have a small car and dont fill up as much now i like get gos for the deli and fresh produce as well as the fuel perks and all the convenance items and you get the same quality products from the giant eagle supermarkets the get go is close to the gap trail and satisfies both bathroom break and rehydrating needs plus theres fresh produce like bananas apples nuts and sandwiches oh and protein bars  and energy drinks  get go has done a nice job of keeping with the trends and changing market theres indoor and outdoor seating so you dont have to rush and can take a moment to check your yelp activity p only one downfall get go like its bigger brother stocks mostly ge items other brands suffer example snidersturners or coulteryahn dairy however they make up for this discrepancy by offering a quality product one thing you dont get from other convenient stores but you do get at get go is calorie counts i know right  but check it out  below the fountain drinks and slushies and milkshakes is the calories in oz very nice get go recommend|love the people and the food  gyros are great frits are perfect every time hot and salty really good comfort food and the best greek fast food in town|good food and fantastic service the employees are very accommodating and patient and the food is fresh and healthy the prices are fair but the portions are a little small  for  pieces of coconut shrimp is a little ridiculous but i will say its the best coconut shrimp ive ever had opt for the ahi tuna salad the salad portions seem bigger than the rice portions and they only have brown rice|the place is decorated so nice here its located on a beautiful street that has paved streets and lots of shopping i am so happy i tried this place i had potatoes and sausage and i started with a salmon on toast so goodwhen i go back to edinburgh i will definitely be back|been here a few times very convenient location to my home love their tortas however the fact that they come with ruffle chips is a little strange on some of the larger tortas you could probably get away with splitting the meal or bringing it home with you salsa is spicier than many other americanized mexican food restaurants which is an added plus  at the end of the meal they give you a dum dum lollipop only gripe would be the fact that their margaritas are non alcoholic they should really splurge on getting that liquor license|awesome cocktails was impressed with the prohibition atmosphere and would recommend to anyone looking to grab a drink off the strip|this is my fourth time seeing a cirque du soleil show inperson ive seen several on tv and initially i thought it would be my last  the first couple of performances were a bit underwhelming plus they all seem to be the same acts just with different themes  if youve seen one cds show then youve seen them all  there is always a juggling act aerial act etc but by the end of the show it truly felt like an amazing experiencea few things to mention  this is not the typical cds show  there is more dancing and theatrics and fewer stunts  the circus aspect is missing this was a nice departure to me because i think the shows have a routine to them that can be predictable but if you are looking for a traditional cds show youll be disappointed  i went during the slow season and got ticket for  a piece  we also go there early and were moved up to better seats without having to pay extrai dont want to ruin some of the surprises for anyone but there were a couple of numbers that really were exciting and i think they did a good job of reflecting who mj was as a performer  i was surprised by some of the songs they chose to include and others such as thriller werent really a surprise but it was still fun to watchid see it again|we go here a lot i love akahana in baxter village we always start out with their house salad with their ginger dressing its great for big groups and we like to have birthdays here they have a great atmosphere and lots of seating you can sit in the formal dining area the bar or on the patio we love their lettuce wraps and they always have buy one get one on the sushi rolls i dont really like their spicy tuna rolls there and that makes me sad becuase thats my favorite kind i recommend the charlotte roll and the bagel roll their noodle stir fry is really good too they are not pricy at all either|so heres the deal i love scoop i frequent there sometimes twice a day the price amazing the drinks bomb af the service questionable heres a super sweet vegan dude that i always chat with that works days thats super cool but everyone else is hella sassy and usually slow i will never stop going just because of service but mr scoop if youre reading this please keep the following in mindblasting an anime movie and hip hop gives me an anxiety attack i dont mind one or the other but when they are both blaring at like  megawatts and the phone is ringing i have to pop a xanax or two just to wait for my super yummy boba tea the chalk board wall is pretty much disgusting i love you|so were here the spa was amazing great massages we did a min massage with the scalp massage included it was great then we lounged around in the jacuzzi checked out the sauna and steam room  my mom and i came as a little get away vacation from vegas they didnt give an upgrade or any discount for being a local and the hotel is completely empty so why not an upgrade anywayyy we went on the hunt for dinner in the shoppes yea that was a bust everything is closed down taped off etc the mexican restaurant thats closest was closed for a private party  so after walking for a while we came back to the hotel lounge the waiter was nice and the food was awesome not too bad wish the shoppes in the village had more going on   the room is nice and cozy the tv looks terrible though and movies on demand cost  geeeesh   the lounge was  stars  the spa was awesome only one mimosa though haha everything else was eh  probably going to mesquite for our next getaway vacation|having spent the night before at a downtown hotel after a concert we were looking for a place for breakfast okay maybe not breakfast exactly  wed closed down a pub at  and were calling the desk at  to verify checkout time but i digressso around noon on a sunday we stopped in at coachs i love its feel of a local joint that may have been around for  years the service was terrific from the hostess the waitress generally everyone we observedfor a small sports bar which has certainly not been around for  years the food is phenomenal i have a weak spot for lobster bisque and theirs is outstanding good and thick with the usual small chunks as well as what had to be an intact seventeen pound slabfish tacos  the young lady ordered these i had one many hours later and it was cold but it was deliciousin what universe would you expect to find hatch chile mac  cheese in a sports bar very filling and so so tasty i took about half of it home and yes its good cold toobloody marys were perfect heinekens were frostynote to self add coachs to list of favorite downtown establishments|my girl said lets go to ruby tuesdays and i was like huh i mean who wants or craves ruby tuesday well we go and it was nothing to tell your friends about and it reminded me why i forgot all about the place food was soso prices were average decor was okay and service was good lots of better choices so if ruby tuesday went out of biz or didnt exist i wouldnt care one bit ruby tuesdaymeh|food was tasty  i tried this desert with cheese and rosemary water    they have bottle drinks    one or  pitas are free with your order|this is a great place to get delicious inexpensive pizzas they even have a stamp card electronic system so you can get a free pizza after purchasing a few i wouldnt rely on just one pizza for feeding two people as the pizzas are small its like subway but for pizzas yes they bake them the wait didnt seem horriblely long even with a couple of people ahead of me|i love going to the cinema edinburgh has its fair share of lovely independent cinemas  the cameo the dominion the filmhouse some of the most memorable cinema going experiences have happened theresome films however benefit from the big screen and the big sound of a multiplex and for most weekends going to vue is realistically more convenient it ended up being my choice for seeing the latest star wars on opening day for a blockbuster like star wars this felt like the right place rather than than the somewhat more sophisticated feel of the filmhouse there are the usual downfalls of these types of big chain cinemas a good  minutes of adverts being one of them their food and drinks are ridiculously over priced and over sized i will confess to being partial to a little popcorn probably out of habit but they refuse to give me anything less than a bucket please  consider selling a small popcorn also i really dont need reminded that a large popcorn and large drink is only p more i know i dont want one if you are going to go to vue or a multiplex this is a good choice ocean terminal has free and super easy parking its quieter than cineworld and i think feels a bit more relaxed as a result there are a good selection of restaurants nearby pizza express wagamamas etc so its good option for a weekend dinner and movie|we ordered for pick up pretty late at night the food was ready quickly and tasted good i had the chicken lo mein and girlfriend had shrimp fried rice the taste could have been a little better but it was still good for the price|went for lunch with a friend and her nephew had a coupon from keno  tashai think thats her name either way she seen my shirt and realized were both from same burb in cleveland she was awesome  food was on point    id go again when i feel like being a fatty  get the pulled pork and spare ribs |some gals from work have been here before and wanted all of us to go here for our last lunch before our winter work break im always up for something new i wanted to try a few different items so i ordered the  item combo with a crunchy chicken taco and shredded beef enchilada the wait staff was great  star just because one order was incorrect and it took a few extra minutes to pay our bills at the end but otherwise awesomethe free chips salsa and bean dip were tasty not hot but had good flavor chips were warm and fresh now on to the meal the chicken taco was full of meat the chicken was flavorful and tender the taco shell was not greasy but the red sauce on it tasted like marinara sauce it threw off the taste of the whole thing and it tasted like i was eating at an italian restaurant a couple of the other girls got tacos as well and found it to be strange i ate some of the shredded beef from the enchilada and it was overly salty the food over all was edible but if your looking for good mexican food or mexican food period i say skip this place prices were pretty equal to most mexican restaurants we ordered ahead of time so we had plenty of time to get there eat and get back to work in an houri doubt id return to jalisco since there are plenty of better mexican restaurants in the area|bought a groupon for  people anytime with gopro video we checked it out on a friday night and thought it was interesting that you have to go through the club to get to the ziplining check in on the nd floor of the rio casino they do have a text messaging system set up but we didnt face any wait at all  we just took the elevators up to the st floor they snapped a few photos  for  and then we hopped on it was a fast but exhilarating ride since the only thing thats keeping you from falling is a shared lap belt the view up there was pretty awesome and the dj was great so if i was back in my ish days and if it wasnt  degrees outside i wouldve loved to stay up there i dont think ill go on it again and wouldnt recommend it for regular price but it was a pretty fun random adventure|i love this restaurant we came group of  people and had a good time good food and service was awesome|our server was paul i think and for some reason i felt he was rushing us to order i had the pulled pork sandwich from their weekly specials it was good just a little too sweet pulled pork had no flavor and it seemed like it was boiled t|after making a stop on the third floor at il tetto we went to emporio to get something to eat before the pens game never saw a restaurant concept built around the humble meatball obviously the ownerchef had to have had other successful places in order to get the financing or to implement the idea for this place you can get  meatballs in a panini  in a hoagie or  on a plate other options include types of cheese and the type of saucesfriendly servers  good selection of craft beers|the meatballs are amazing which is good because thats all they sell but they have so many different options for meat sauces and if you want the meatball alone or on a bun etc there are also wonderful soup and salad options as well as a great draft list you can also go upstairs while you are waiting on this level but the drinks are pricey overall the food is delicious and i would go back again|they showed up on time didnt try to add a bunch of fees did the work and charged me what they quoted  good experience and the carpets are clean|hastag breakfast is surprisingly mcd like just with waffles instead of buns west coast wafflewich is delightful just right for those who like small morning bites maple bacon waffle has bacon made into the waffle thats another pleasant surprise strawberry sunrise and banana berry is both very good healthy smoothie|what a cute brunch spot  it looked like a pretty house in here and the outdoor seating is beautiful as welli had their super southern breakfast bowl which came with some eggs tons of goat cheese grits yum blackeyed peas salsa cheese and bacon  it was delicious  oh and i absolutely loved how we all got our own individual biscuits with jam to start off with  gotta love biscuitsthe only con is what a lot of other yelpers mentionedservice is really slow  it took a good  minutes to get our food after we ordered|after a long road trip back home i went to dinner at tupelo honey cafe in charlotte its a cute little place on south boulevard i shouldnt say little because its rather big it has an adorable outdoor area to sit a regular dining area and a bar area i want to go there for breakfast one of these sundays and sit outsidewe started with a jumbo crab cake over jalapeo aioli greens and baby tomatoes the meal also came with a homemade buttermilk biscuit which was out of this world it was buttery flakey and gradually melted in your mouthi ordered the tomato cider glazed atlantic salmon with a side of sweet potato fries and a salad the salmon was reallllly good but the sweet potato fries were coldwe sat in the bar area and our waiter wasnt very friendly and the service was very slow|we love this place all of the ingredients are really fresh and delicious the unique salsa bar is a nice touch as well|latereview came in during pm with a couple people to try them outaround that time they were packed if thats how lunch rush is on a sunday i would hate to see it on a saturday but good for them came in and had the followingtacos asada al pastor   tacos were not my pick because i normally get lingua cabeza tripas so not my first choice but i enjoyed it i appreciated the hand made tortillas fluffy and not hard just the right amount of salsa that they put on for you im picky since i would rather control the amount myself but still good the onions werent over poweringmichelada   perfect amount of tajin and hot sauce not too spicy but not weak either elotes  nothing memorable just your corn mayo cheese and spices but still yummy to eat corn was surprisingly sweettorta  this was actually done pretty good the bread they chose and the size complimented the amount of meat they put in it normally youll get a soggy bread with very little meat and way too much filler but not this one all in all i would come back again nothing that makes it stand out for me to go all the way to dtlv from henderson but if i was in the area ill definitely give them a try im just very partial to taco y taco thats all|had dinner there heres the breakdownappetizer samsa basically a samosa only with beef and onion delicious adinner item  kavsar beef this got many mentions on here the good news is that the smaller pieces of meat were tasty and the rice with them was good too the bad news is that the big pieces were very tough cdinner item  palov like a pot roast over fried ricefairly straightforward tasty but unremarkable bdessert baklava terrificnot overly sweet and a nice sized serving aso its a bit of a mixed bag the dinner entrees were a bit disappointing but the appetizer and dessert were good enough for me to boost them up to four stars plus having an uzbek restaurant in town is nice|as always the food was fantastic exactly what youd expect from mellow mushroom the service however was nonexistent after our food was brought to our table the next time we saw our server was when we were flagging him down to get our checkour glasses had been empty for the majority of our meal not impressed particularly since there were only two other tables of customers in the entire place i hate to think what it would be like during peak hours or on a game day|its okay but too expensive for what you get i prefer other kabob places with lower prices but they are located at town square which i guess is why they charge so much|i love the peppermint hot chocolate but tonight i waited  minutes in the drive thru to pull up to the window and be told they were out of key ingredients for the drink i wanted i was very disappointed also i wish that i could get my drink in peace without all the awkward what are you doing tonight where do you work cool bro small chat they lean so far out the window sometime i feel like they are in my car with me|between  and  starsordering was a mess for a party of  but once we could retreat to the tables out front the food was pretty greatstandouts were lamb burger soup of the day potato leek wbacon and caprese salad nice homemade ranch dressing on the greens tuna salad was good not great latte was half the size of the mug owner came out to greet us which was a nice addition|this was the sixth time i have eaten here the service is always spot on  risotto and fresh pasta are always superb some of the best tiramisu around dane county lunch or dinner you will not be disappointed|in a hurry this place is perfect for getting pizza togo i had the spinach chicken pizza  and garlic knot  my favorite part was the garlic knot so soft and fluffy the pizza is huge i couldnt finish it though it was good but a little too oily and salty for my taste i will definitely be back for the garlic knots though they also sell them  for |great prices good sushi and a quiet comfy atmosphere would definitely come again fresh yummy new choices and a friendly staff makes this a win win on a date night|divey just how we like it taco tuesday is different but goodburgers are pretty darn good sweet potato fries are outstanding and the beer is mighty cold|wow dumplings in parkex thats great they were not that bad either i loved the lamb just like china but the curry chicken was a little strange for me i gave it a try but felt it did not taste chinese enough still  stars as everything else was great and i will be back|we had the seasoned fries with cheddar and mozzarella cheese very tasty and dinner was a slice each of pepperoni pizza we were having dinner on the late side so we opted not to fill up too much not too crazy about the soda cans with no refills great service with quick food delivery|finally got to try oss after they have been on my list for over a year they had samples of their sausages at the isthmus beer and cheese fest last year and the banh mi sausage was great so when i came into their place on regent i decided to try something different i decided on the doner kebab as i was there for lunch on a work day so didnt want anything too spicy i also noticed they had a special on buffalo cheese curds i have read many times how good the curds were but add in a buffalo sauce sprinkled with blue cheese how could anyone say no to that the curds were  star crispy but light breading high quality cheese great dipping sauce it probably took me only  minutes to devour all of them in what i am sure is a portion size made for  what can i say i am an overachiever the sausage was a little disappointing the chili mayo and cucumber sauce were fantastic but there was a little too much slaw on there which made it hard to get to the actual sausage  the onions were also really overpowering once some of it was removed it was a lot better experience for me the service was great one of the guys at the counter asked me how i had heard of the place and walked me through the entire menu he was very attentive and really wanted to know how my experience was this place was really close to getting  stars and probably would have had i just gone for the banh mi again i will definitely be back regent street has found another gem|we came here for a birthday celebration dinner as a family of four the staff was pleasant and attentive the cocktails i especially liked khaleesi tasted good the view was absolutely beautiful but the foodwell lets just say id go back for a drink and to enjoy the view but not for the food|everything was good waitress betsy efficient and sweet food hubs loved it i thought everything was good service prompt we orderedapps steamed mussels perfection dozen happy hour oysters on the half shell greatlobster mac  cheese ridiculously rich and creamy and thick and heavy and a huge portion beware its enough for  people easilydinner chiopinno not crazy about the fennel teragon sauce not much fish no pasta or rice brothbasedvery lightfish  chips fries were thin and crispy and hot and fish was beerbattered and tasty desserts benniets sent them back didnt like them at all they smelled like pizza dough and they were completely airfilled and hollow inside the chocolate sauce was like that sickeningly sweet cheap hersheys syrup you add to milk to make it chocolate milk just grosscreme brle very goodgalato two scoops one salted caramel and one pistachio kinda weird combo but you cant go wrong with galato|lovely kimchi ramen nice and spicy i think people are being too severe rating this place i myself is a ramen fan and ramen comes from different regions in japan this is why some places have a specific taste so it is a very personal taste and there isnt the best ramen place they are all different this place is a bit fusion since kimchi is korean but they excelled at the presentation and taste of it bravo|nice place to skate having grown up in the northeast portion of the country skating in the desert can be  an interesting concept i wanted to take my nephew and get some ice skating in while on vacation and thats when i found az ice peoria az ice has two rinks  the south rink is olympic sized and the north rink is just slightly smaller  az ice is a great place to have a tournament or be a spectator  there is viewing in bleacher style seating and the facility is comfortable and clean throughout  however the ice at times isnt in the best condition a couple of times around the rink and you soon find out what ice to stay away fromthe location was easy to find slightly difficult to get into the first time  az ice may not be  rockefeller center however  it does the job for us phoenicians|the autumn greens salad tasted average drowned in apple vinaigrette saucethe pizza quality tasted average compared to pieology choose the genovese over the gianna pizza are  inches and are cut in four if you cant eat much i would recommend sharing a pizza with someone youll probably get full from  slices|i was impressed the doctor saw me within a few minutes of my scheduled time i was met by a nurse at the door shown to an examining room and  doctors showed up quickly the second one was  a medical student he had a badge with  a u of a emblem on it but they were both involved and professional they listened answered my questions and then a rd doctor showed up the one who i was scheduled to see he reviewed their work quickly answered my questions and gave me some options i was out of there within  minutes|it was pretty good good salsa selection|legit dumplings with relatively good service prices are also okay and dumplings are served in time|free  hr tours led by a passionate car enthusiast i was surprised about the amount of folks a few from out of the country that were on the car tour on a weekday morning the place is clean and open and they have lots of gorgeous cars to look at if you go on the tour you can go into the factory but can see everything that youd encounter on the tour by just doing a selftour at the end of the tour you do get to sign your name with sharpies provided which was kinda fun i learned a lot some cool souvenirs good spot to go if youre a car enthusiast or like nerdy factory tours for me but if youre limited on your time in las vegas then do more typical vegas activities back on the strip |ive been here a couple times now and ive liked everything i triedboth times i got the two sides and a protein meal i cant remember one of the sides from the first visit but the other was the quinoa wcorn which i loved one of my friends who i came here wthe last time ordered this and i pretended like i never had it before just so i could have a bite  the protein i had was the chicken which was kind of plain i guess thats the point here though but it was tender and wellseasoned the second time i came i got the brussel sprouts sweet potato and tofu the tofu is grilled which is how i like it the two sides were flavorful the sweet pots were particularly good they were cooked all the way through but werent mushy my group also ordered the avocado hummus which was delicious it was creamy  the pita was really good both times i came here i remember not thinking they give you a lot of food for what you pay for however i was full but not disgustingly bloated each time so i do think they give you more food than what it looks like on your plate the first time i came here this place was out the door packed you order at the counter and the food is brought to your table but the last time it wasnt too bad the food comes fairly quickly  the servers are friendly|i really enjoy indian buffets so i go to a lot of them but this one was somewhat inadequate granted all the ones ive been to have been on the east coast so this might be great for madisonwisconsin i got my usual mango lassi to accompany my meal and it came with whipped cream and maraschino cherries and what seemed to be grenadine why would you do that not only does the mango not taste like real mango the lassi came out way sweeter than any ive had and probably sweeter than any proper lassi youd find in india in a similar vein the food was ok but it was missing the potency so signature of indian spice that fragrance thats supposed to envelop you when at indian restaurants where is the meaty grilledness in the tandoori chicken where is that earthy cumin in your samosa everything just tasted kind ofimpotent i cant tell if its because theyre trying to pander to midwestern tastes or if theyre skimping on the spices for business reasons but i left the place without the taste of pungency that i was really hoping to load up on when i go to indian buffetsps  after reading a few reviews from some indian customers that also mentioned that they could improve their flavor i feel like less of a crazy person it seems that theyre spiced just ok for midwestern palates but could be missing something if youre looking for really traditional indian food|my boyfriend and i visited nandini for the lunch buffet this place was delicious and had great veggie options the garlic naan is to die for truly amazing my rating is as high as it is because of the naan the owner was very nice constantly checking in on us that could be both a pro or a con depending on what you like and clearing plates the second we finished our food however my boyfriend had severe stomach issues following our experience there as ive noticed is the issue with many indian places there really was a lack of labeling that makes it hard for anyone with dietary restrictions or someone that isnt familiar with indian cuisine to try all the delicious food it was also rather empty which got a little uncomfortable at some pointsi will be back to try the dinner and will update my review accordingly|i love this place ive always gotten the mango berry salad but ive tried a couple sandwiches all are totally delicous hot and fresh you can taste every ingredient and how fresh it really is the only reason im giving this place four stars is because the ordering process is kind of a hassle and takes a while there are like  people asking you what you ordered and what soup and salad and sandwich you want and then you have to repeat what you got again to the person at the cash register other than that everyone here is always super happy and nice and the food is delish|omg how have i gone my whole life without this place went on saturday  about pm this restaurant is on the southeast corner of stephanie and warm springs  follow the entrances for sunset station for the easiest entry  you order right at the counter and they make your food right in front of you  order your sammiches and salads first and then scoot on down to the soup area to order yummy soups  i love their modern trendy decor and the place is so bright and clean the staff were so cheery and helpful i like that they do not accept tips as it should be for counter service   got us two of their try two combos two fountain drinks and a berry creme brulee  i got the bbq chicken salad and the california turkey sandwich  hubs got the tomato soup and the ultimate grilled cheese  both meals came with a slice of baguette and a chocolatecovered strawberry bbq chicken salad comes with housechopped mixed greens housemade ranch dressing chicken bbq sauce red onions grape tomatoes fire roasted corn black olives black beans  tortilla strips  i love that the salad came already dressed and the lettuce to toppings ratio was perfect the california turkey sandwich comes with turkey avocado tomatoes sprouts cucumbers mixed greens muenster cheese  housemade sundried tomato herb spread  i asked for honey mustard instead of the tomato herb spread and they were happy to oblige  i love that they have sprouts because i havent seen many places that have them the creme brulee did not have a rich and decadent taste at allit was more like a vanilla pudding  i think next time ill try the chocolate one  their drink fountains have a ton of choices and they have about  syrups in different flavors to spice up your drink  there were some cute recipes printed right on the cups  i want to try everything on the menu|im grading on a curve here but for a restaurant this expensive the most expensive italian restaurant ive ever seen i just wasnt all that impressed  first the good  a diverse menu of italian dishes meant to be enjoyed over at least three courses  a nicely appointed room with a great view of the strip  caesars palace and the bellagio across the street somewhat marred on the night we dined by the massive fatal car crash just down the street but thats hardly giadas fault  and giada really knows how to pack the flavor into her dishes  my bacon wrapped dates crab crostini and tricolore salad all screamed their respective flavorsbut there were some aspects i didnt care for  first the food is rich rich rich even for italian  even though i only had two appetizers and a salad i felt bloated on the way out and i can usually pack it away  second the relentless emphasis on giadas name  our waiter only mentioned her about two or three dozen times  the plates menu and even the towels in the bathroom were emblazoned with giada  ive never seen anything like it at any other celebrity chef restaurant and ive been to a bunch of them  third and i really dont know how to explain this but the atmosphere just didnt feel comfortable to me  the dining room is a little bit crowded and a bit of a maze to get through  the menu is a slightly difficult to figure out and the waiter wasnt that much help the answer to every question about the menu was a story about how giada loves this or that dish  and the presentation of every dish was kind of wow  look at me  in short everything was just a little bit overwhelming and i guess my mental image of italian food is of comfort food in a homey environment so it just felt a little off to me|this boutique hotel was in a great location rooms were clean and nice decor there was a complimentary breakfast which exceeded my expectation two eggs nice thick sourdough toast potatoes  slices of bacon and a very large assortment of fruit and choice of juice or coffee all was delicious|chocolate lovers dream come true simple as that chocolate everything and hell make sure if your an adult you get your chocolate fix in the form of liquid alcohol infused chocolate drinks easily one of the coolest and most unique bars in vegas and def worth trying a few as there all very tasty this is one of my fav places to visit in vegas since it open|got in around  pm  happy hour was nice surprise food is nice but sushi little bit expensive and taste little bit plain or maybe it is just las vegas roll didnt taste the way i like it and got used too soup was good  all together nice place with good service and atmosphere will come back and recommend|when i asked where this place was located i was pleased to learn it was located right across from the courtyard hotel on penn ave il tetto is on the third floor part of a three restaurant complex there is a small elevator located on the first floor that you use to reach the roof top upstairs you will find a open airy bar at the time i went december the glass roof was closed but still allowed natural light inthe bar is long with plenty of seats also they have a number of large tables that seat  or more the have a diverse varied craft beer menu i went with the alpine double hoppines which was outstanding give this place a chance|its one of the only places i like for burritos they have lots of ingredients and choices i think it is a bit expensive but one small burrito fills me up fine i would recommend it even though not many people know about it or like it that much|first i have to say i am so glad i am not a food truck owner why the competition alone would just stress me out i know that if you have a great product people will buy it but the food truck scene in charlotte has explodedbleu barn was parked outside of three spirits saturday night i had already eaten dinner times two but as many know food trucks are my kryptonite meal number three here we come chicken tacos caprese style chicken with tomatoes balsamic and shaved asiago very juicy im not a big corn tortilla fan but they were still delicious even better was the roasted beet salad red and golden with an asian glaze ive heard great things about their burgers so ive already planned out what im eating next time i bump into these guysgals|the pizza was delicious the sausage had such hearty flavors disappointed about not receiving sauces and side items when being charged for them though hmm|love going to wasted grain saw metal head for the first time great security staff|everything was good except the chicken im fairly certain the chicken was not thoroughly cooked slightly disappointed only good thing was the discount from bitesquad|i failed at taking a picture of my market salad sorry yall but it was realllly good i ate it too quickly the spiced pumpkin seeds were the winner here the farro was good the currants were delicious but the pumpkin seeds were legit i wish they had massaged the kale good thing i like tough kale the golden beets are sweeter than red beets so they provided a nice compliment to the bitter kale and the salty pumpkin seeds i cant wait to come back and camp out for the day earls has a mini coffee shop bakery and does lunch entrees and sandwiches and has tempting and tasty looking sides and meals you can purchase too plus a cute little wine shop and space for getting work done earls you have a good thing going here elizabeth street is becoming my new favorite street in charlotte|disclaimer this is primarily a bad review for the delivery company used through yelp on  and not the restaurant or their food it would have been nice for the restaurant to try and rectify this but it was not their fault i ordered via yelp eat around  pm i got a call at  from the delivery man saying there was a problem with a different order coming out late so mine would be another  minutes i paid more than  with a  tip on top of the  delivery charge finally at  i called the restaurant and found that the delivery service still hadnt picked up the order i asked if it had gotten cold and she affirmed that it had they did not offer a resolution but told me that the transaction went through yelps system and they couldnt do anything on their end this is not acceptable i asked to cancel but there was nothing for her to cancel the food had been prepared i called the delivery guy back and said i wanted to cancel he said he would call his customer service and try to cancel it i repeatedly asked that he have them call me and confirm the cancellation he not sounding confident said that he would have them call me with confirmation its now  and the charge is still pending no call back i will now email yelp for my refund hoping i dont have to dispute it update i emailed yelp and explained what happened they returned my email on the next business day to let me know the refund has been processed|after passing by a few times i finally took the time to check this place out and i must say im so glad i did it is located in the same weird area as braddahs on warms springs and tenaya it is literally a hidden gem angus beef gyoza this is one great tasting dish the beef was really flavorful that every bite made me went hmmm it is easy to overcook beef specially if you try to fry it but the chef cooked it so perfectly my only concern was since the beef was a little fatty it was a little bit oilygreasy still it was very goodrock shrimp we ordered this as an appetizer it reminded me of the bang bang shrimp from bonefish but instead of the sweet spicy sauce it was in a yuzu sauce that was tangy and spicy delicious i fell in love with every bite chilean sea bass this dish was listed under the chefs specialty part of the menu it came with a cilantro sauce that paired perfectly with the fish it was panfried to perfection giving it that crispy bite highly recommended scottish salmon this dish was also from the chefs specialty menu the salmon was panfried to your preference i always get mine mediummedium well like a perfect steak do not get your fish well done it really is a waste the flavor was spot on good it tasted like teriyaki with a hint of yuzu it came with a house salad and the sauce they used for that you can dip your fish in to give it that extra ump yuzu coconut mochi with genmai cha ice cream what better way to end a perfect dinner but with a perfect dessert the mochi was the best one ive tasted so far it is not frozen so it was soft and chewy the ice cream totally hit the spot for me i love genmai cha as a tea but for it to an ice cream flavor it was heaven on earth the chefs cooking skills are phenomenal every dish that came out that that kitchen was a work of art next time i come here i will try and catch their happy hour i heard a lot of good things about it a good way to sample a lot of the items on their menu|i usually go to pho chandler but i wanted to give this restaurant a chance since it is really close to my house service was okay at first but our waiter forgot about us at the end and we waiting a good  minutes to get a to go box and pay our check i ended trying a bun dish which was pretty good food was good but i wish the service was more warm and attentive|sitting outside along the strip was quite enjoyable the burgers were delicious we ordered a beer tower and when we poured the beer we noticed absolutely no head on any of the beers we tasted the beer and everyone thought it was flat we told the server she came back with a manager and the manager asked whats the problem with your beer we told her that we all thought it was flat she immediately responded oh yah we have been having problems with our co if you know there is a problem then why would you ask us whats the problem with your beer anyway she quickly offered to get us something else and offered to upgrade to a more expensive beer i definate would go back|went into vanity vapor today to try some juices huge juice selection almost too big had some off the wall flavors like pizza yuck and chicken and waffles didnt try those flavors but honestly who wants to vape those flavors anyway there was only one young kid in there working spent a lot of time socializing with his girlfriend and friends was helpful but not knowledgeable  when asked what was in certain flavors he didnt know another couple came in to try flavors and he just handed them a tip and battery didnt explain how to use it or any of the flavors just handed them the stuff and went back to socializing the couple hadnt been in before and didnt know how to work the battery  the last flavor i tried was red velvet sounds like it would be amazing but it was horrible tasted like it had been sitting around for awhile and had spoiled or something now the positives like i said good selection the fruity flavors were amazing  good prices on juice discount if you bring in your own bottle juices made in house can customize nic level and flavor profile will i be back probably not i can get the same flavors of higher quality at other stores|your standard mcdonalds the interior is retrocontemporary with avocado and beige accents our order was made in a short amount of time with no problems|the chips and salsa were excellent got the chile relleno it was ok nothing special the neighborhoods not great|my first visit to vegas i stayed at the las vegas hilton this was way before the thought of living here ever even entered my reality two namechanges later this spot is so similar i can intuitively find everything on property it feels like absolutely no time has passed particularly in the sports book which is still broadcasting in sdlocation is pretty spreadout onsite gym has been replaced by a tattoo lounge and relocated upstairs to a smaller space still outdated selfpark is a large spread out maze the onsite pizza hut and donut shop are now closed not a welcoming sight entering from the parking lot definitely a budget option for vacationersthe closetostrip convenience and the monorail are the only main benefits to staying here most recent addition to this casino is their elvis exhibit with a whopping  entry fee and few to no discounts available it will probably be another few years before i stay here again|dined here with my boss on a tuesday night approximately two months ago attention from all staff was wonderful the food was delicious and the atmosphere was nice as well as we were seated outside i had some sort of pasta cant remember the name but similar to the spaghetti and meat sauce but it was one of their evening special plates it was delicious all ingredients were super fresh and the portion size was perfect  the bread with oils vinaigrette and spicy sauce was delicious as well|when i come to zia records i expect to be thrown into a nostalgic haze for the time im in the store i like the memorabilia selections the top music in the local scene is good to see whats hot in the area i come here often to just walk around in my s time capsule prices are fair and the store is nice|quite a taste bud pleaser here sampled the beef and shrimp skewers the couscous the chicken pita and the homemade hot sauce all were very tasty and quality ingredients hummus was a little too thin for my tastes but the flavor was okay as were the soft pita slices they give you to go with i really liked the chicken though probably my favorite thing so far the house made hot sauce was really good too kind like sambal olek style and a good kick to it|hadnt been up to this new location yet pretty nice layout not like the dinky crowded one i usually go toand i think they menu prices reflect that just because its in summerlin lets jack up the prices bah i know i dont pay  for a sandwich in my regular shopregardless the sandwich chain is still one of my faves|this is the same new seoul that used to be location by the university  the food here is really good but the service could be better  its not exactly their fault  their server is as attentive as he could be the problem is that he was the only server here at time  no matter he does his best and he is really nice  id definitely recommend the chicken bulgogi and the pork bokum the pork is spicy and flavorful and the chicken is super tender the quality of their ingredients and flavors are quite great which keeps me coming back hehe and unlimited small side dishes woohoo if you ever need more flavor or spice ask for their spicy sauce |the food here is good bar food and its always a nice quiet atmosphere the bartenders are always very nice|i love it when people complain about long lines  days before christmas  hello moronsif you dont have time to shop then dont all stores will be this way and heads up most employees will be seasonal aka brand new|la bouffe tait vraiment bonne pour le prix jai pris une bento box  spcial du midi le dcor est trs beau mais je donne quun  toiles car le service tait vraiment ordinaire jai pos une question sur le menu et le serveur a quasiment fait un soupir  nos soupes miso ne sont pas toutes arrivs en mme temps et tide pour la moiti ils servent des verres deau dans des verres en plastiques jetables  a devrait tre interdit jy retournerai peuttre pour une bento box bien rapide sans trop dattente pour le service  comme si jtait dans un fast food|samples a few of their tacos gudilles drinks and desserts allinall quite good the tacos average about  each but come with two shells and a decent amount of toppings so we were able to split each order into two easily without them being too skimpy i actually preferred the gudille tried the pork one to the tacos but both were quite good we had a seasonal pumpkin taco which had no dairy and frankly didnt really need it it was pretty flavourful and had a pumpkin seed salsa which seemed pretty originalthe desserts were good but out of the three we sampled a bunch between all of us one really stood out which was the ice cream sandwich cocktails were quite nice as was the atmosphere it is pretty small in there so if youre looking for some intimacy maybe not the place to go we were seated at the bar and had a plethora of takeaway customers standing beside and behind us service was a weeeee bit slow but the food made up for it ill be back|a nice little spot on beaubien offering a vast brunch and lunch menu ive been a few times to meet with clients and the food was quite good a couple of times i just had tea and a snack and that was fine too|the owner is super nice and the fried chicken tastes really clean simple and not too greasy also the portions are good too would go here again  yum|these heat lamps really work dont let them fool you my veal piccata was pretty strong but the shrimp tag is a true pass especially after how strong the waitress sold it overall decent not great|great food great atmosphere a little pricey and sometimes extended waits due to popularity i would definitely recommend giving it a try|went in for a brazilian kami was personable and made it a comfortable experience she took the time to explain some things to me which was nice|the concept of the salads is pretty cool any of the other food items are pretty much straight from the eatn park menu the food is pretty consistent with any other eatn park so its hit or miss one thing about this location though  it stinks literally they open their garage doorwindows in the summer time and it just smells like a really dirty wet rag when you walk past its as if they used one dirty rag to clean the entire place over and over again if you can get past the smell the food is ok otherwise just make the extra effort and go to an eatn park diner outside of downtown|got a few gifts here for christmas this year really good high quality products would love too see more gift baskets incorporating several of the products that they sell  oils pastas wines etc customer service is great always trying to help you find something |seems great although it sucked that there wasnt a child changing table in the womans bathroom and i had to lay out my sweater on the bathroom floor to change my sons diaper pizza seemed good had a atmosphere similar to chipotle but with pizza|great classic french bistro food was simple yet delicious and the atmosphere was vibrant and young had a frise salad and the steak frites au poivres two of my favorite classic bistro dishes they did not disappoint|the menu looks great so i had high hopes for this place  but after trying it twice i dont think ill be back  i have tried several menus items and they are all just okay  on this latest visit i tried the chicken and biscuit sliders basically  they didnt come with the house pickles as i see in pictures from other yelpers so it looks like they have taken those away  the disappointing thing is that they werent chicken breast like most good chicken biscuits  one was breast and one was thigh  ugh i wish they would say that in advance   at  for two it is just way overpriced for what you get  cocktails are good but they should be at   the big miss on my first visit was the shrimp and grits  probably the worst i have ever tasted  the fried chicken is serviceable but i wished it was better there is just too much good food in vegas to go back here|the duck wings are great with the spicy flavor embedded in the sweetness the all american burger is cooked to my order but it is just ok the lobster shrimp macncheese is a little grease but does have a lot of lobster meat and shrimps the butcher steak is totally pver cooked and not hot at all when it is served our waiter is very friendly and ask the kitchen for  replacement our foods come in very slowly and my kids asked me a thousand times when our food will be here the overall service is ok and foods are good|not sure what the hype is about  its decent but way overpriced and way small portions  i guess people are treating this like innout used to be  at least shake shack has pretty good bacon on their burgers  on the the hand innout is significantly less expensive  oh id also say shake shacks cheese fries are better than innout fries but ive always hated innout fries  over all if find another place for burgers and fries before going back to shake shack  not worth the hype to me|its pretty good i like their fries and the custard the burger is pretty good but not for the price we got the shake shack something that came with the deep fried mushroom i thought the burger was way to cheese and didnt have enough meat|crinkle cut fries are so good love how theyre crispy but not greasy the bun on the burger is a bit buttery but overall really good just had this last week in ny and its just as good here in vegas|some people tell me how amazing shake shack is and then theres other people who tell me how overrated it is well my verdict solid  stars  everyone compares it to innout but i personally think they are quite different first off the atmosphere innout has the allamerican fast food feel shake shack is a bit hipstery with their wooden benches and fancier menu boards they also have no drivethru at least not the one in vegas second price points innout is ridiculously cheap as all fast food institutions should be shake shacks prices are higher up there not gourmet burger status but close to something you would find at a sitdown burger jointnow onto the food i would pay  for a full meal here i ordered the cheeseburger the patty was juicy the lettuce and tomatoes were fresh the bread was nicely toasted all tied together with a thousandislandy sauce not as good as innout spread though simple and clean flavors we also ordered the cheese fries they were hot and crispy with a good amount of cheese melted on top overall i would come back especially if im around the ny ny hotel but if im driving back to la already innout at barstow is the way to go|while visiting the tempe area  exhausted from the holiday shopping i wanted to try some good pizza  called zesty zzeeks the pizza was delivered timely hot xlrg was huge  it was very good so thanks yelp|portion sizes are small and items can be pricey for the size the tandoori chicken is fantastic  got it with the garlic naan  which was fluffy and flavorful samosas are big  hot  and filling  good eats all around|i have brought both my vehicles into usa auto on durango for the last  months dave and the crew of mechanics always go the extra mile i have older rides so they need work unfortunately more frequently i am on a budget and need the most for the minimum dave will throw in an oil change or smog with repair because he knows i need the help repairs suck but they are part of life make dave and usa auto on durango part of your life you wont regret it dan m|i had this place bookmarked for a while so i was looking forward to stopping in and doing some shopping at carolina place mall gave me the perfect opportunity normally i have the time to check out the menu before to at least have an idea of what im going to order but i didnt have the opportunity too before this visit so yes i was the one person in line reading the menu telling others to go ahead i cant decide what i want to trysorry when i got up to the counter i was still confused but the man that helped me out was very friendly he asked if it was my first timeyes and how id heard about themyelp of course and ran down some suggestions i saw on the menu board that the current special was the wedge salad and soup of the day was corn chowder perfect i grabbed a drink and the tealemonade bar is awesome i chose the mango lemonade and found a booth my food arrived shortly after and was prepared as i requested the salad was good typical wedge with iceberg lettuce blue cheese bacon and dressing no tomatoes for me but they come standard the soup was good too it was a little sweet but there was a good balance of flavors and the mini croissant was divine a really nice touch id definitely come back to this place and bring some friendsespecially since the prices were so reasonable|smoke was one of the first restaurants i checked out when i moved to lawrenceville last year and it remains one of my favorites you feel the classic lawrenceville vibe as soon as you walk in the door rustic hipster and a few contemporary touches on any given night youll find this hotspot packed with both locals and touristsword to the wise call ahead they do not take reservations but will take your name down if you are on your way youll be able to cut a good chunk of time off your wait by doing this smoke is rather small and even on weeknights your wait can be  minutes to an hour at peak dinner timesthe menu is concise yet wellrounded which i appreciate this is a restaurant where youll discover your favorite items and want to get the same ones every time you come for me its the chips and queso as an appetizer and the chicken apple bacon taco as an entree the chips are made inhouse and are kind of like a pitatortilla hybrid the queso is rich and sharp the chicken apple bacon taco is one of their most popular with good reason ive tried other tacos here and always come back to this one the apples provide a sweetness that contrasts perfectly with the saltiness of the chicken and bacon the sauce has a zing to it but is not too spicy pair this duo with a delicious agua fresca flavored water made fresh daily and youve got yourself quite a delicious mealunfortunately i find no choice but to deduct a star for inconsistency ive been to smoke probably ten times or so and i find that wait times for food vary immensely just a couple weeks ago my friends and i ordered chips and queso and it was brought out in under five minutes today however we waited almost  minutes for our queso to come out of the kitchen on a monday no less we were only told that things were backed up back there and that it would hopefully be out soon i understand that smoke does a lot of takeout orders and that its a bit unpredictable for them however the inconsistency in food preparation times makes it almost impossible for you to plan an evening around dinner here if you come and youre in a rush you may be disappointed despite the inconsistency im always willing to wait for one of these tacos|ive wanted to try this place for awhile and finally my husband and i tried it for lunch let me just tell you if you dont order anything else order the bacon garlic jam on toast omg it is to die for pro tip you can buy the wonderful bacon garlic jam to bring home as a gift for  truffles and bacon offers up a huge menu of breakfast items sandwiches burgers and more all their starters sounded excellent but i had to try their bacon garlic jam on toast i also ordered the soup of the day which was mushroom soup my husband decided on the brie blt wow it takes a lot to impress me and my stomach these days let me tell you this meal was out of this world i could not get enough of the warm rendered down bacon mixed with the sauted garlic it came in a tiny cup with sourdough toast points i wanted to just dump it all in my mouth my mushroom soup was ok the flavor was good but it had a gritty texture my husbands brie blt was delicious the rye bread was filled with slices of brie cheese sauted mushrooms and bacon it came with a side salad and sinful tots definitely get the sinful tots they are crispy tots covered in the bacon garlic jam cheese and sliced peppercinis it is definitely worth the extra money for the upgraded tots the staff was very friendly and our order came out quickly they also packaged up my bacon garlic jam that you can buy to take home in beautiful wrapping paper truffles and bacon has a great menu and they back it up with food that will knock your socks off|unassuming location but was encouraged by other good reviews to purchase the groupon for an hour massage  and was happy i did  after a professional intro to discuss my expectations i received one of the best swedish massages ive had  the room and table are set up very comfortably and the massage does last the full hour as others pointed out  the heated blanket and warm towels on my back after massage were appreciated  i was there when gym was empty and so the massage rooms were quiet and very relaxing  i will definitely return|your review helps others learn about great local businesses on arriving settled down for a short wait once seated service was good with waitress offering advice on both food  beverages one of us opted for the sage chickeni it was crunchy onthe outside whilst moist tenderon the inside two of us had breakfast i opted for the pork sausage yummy and a side of crispy baconthe potatoes were crunchy and the biscuit to die for we all had eggs over easy and thats how they camethe strawberry conserve with no additives was a treatservice great thanks hh kennyplease dont review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review or if youre connected in any way to the owner or employees|you guys can go ahead and close the investigation i figured out what the name means tups is from one of the owners last name tupy the more you know billed as a specialty sandwich shop i think the village greek salad  is the best in town its huge and easily makes two meals for me even without the side of pita bread the feta vinagrette is amazing and made in house shop is family owned and operated with two awesomely sweet teens running the register grandma supervising and dad running the kitchen as the signs say its fresh food not fast food wait time is reasonable for the freshness portion and quality are on par with the pricing|dinner at hexx consisted of sugar coated pressed bacon macaroni and cheese and filet mignon the filet was like butter tender and full of favor sugar coated baconnot a good idea and not very tasty the mac and cheese was just ok nice atmosphere and the waitress was superb but it was definitely overpriced and i probably will not eat there again|we sat at the barexcellent service and great food we love this restaurant for its ambiance and their tacos sean the bartender is outstanding  across from us was the weather anchor for channel  so this is the place for the locals|have been to many mongolian bbqs this one seemed small and a bit amateurish in the implementation looked like they wanted to put in the new location as quickly and as cheap as they could the food turned out fine but was awkward getting there and was way more expensive than other ones i have visited  vs  for all you can eat  service was spotty  ownermanager was cooking one order but was reluctant to engage my puzzled looks on how to proceed|i was actually heading to the pretzel joint next door and sign a sign for a pocket burger drink and fries for   i figured it was only  more than i would spend at the pretzel joint so why not try iti was pretty surprised how good the burger was  service was quick and accommodating  the food is cooked to order so thats a good thing not everyone does thisbottom line i was surprised by the quality and the price point and i do believe i would try it again|its trying and its trying hard which i appreciate im looking forward to seeing this place develop and mature the main gripe i have about the bar at desoto is bad service  every single time i go it takes forever to get a dink there is no sense of urgency from the bartenders all of my friends have corroborated this on separate occasions so i know its not just bad luck i love the concept of this place and the food has been good but expensive at all of the vendors   from the coffee place to the salad place i love the layout the free wifi  the abundant water the burgers are great the bao from adobo dragon is delicious and the salad place has a great variety as well|i love this local dig great food great choice of craft beer and a great ambiance for both grabbing drinks with the boys or bringing out the family they keep the place under control and have a few different sections the outside bar area is awesome overlooking the downtown park and the train tracks youll probably hear the train go by at some point great burgers very tasty i highly recommend checking this place out|love the burgers and shakes do wish the frys were better love me some hot crispy frys with a burger never get them the sweet potato are the better of the choices|got here at p and seated p went to restroom and was slipped the floor was extremely wet and luckily i didnt crack my head lol anyhow service was subpar after being seated we waited for almost  minutes before waiter came to get our order when he came to take it we told him we never received menus so we didnt know how it worked or what to eat so he returned with the menus we ordered and our foo came out after about  minutes we had to ask for oil and salt because they forgot that too and they apologized they were very friendly but just busy and forgetful food was awesome and on point just slow service when we left it was almost pdinner prices  reasonable but we went in for lunch and it ended up being longer than what we expected but food was very good and they were nice peoplejust slow so if you have patience the food is worth the wait  even though i fell and hurt my leg because of their wet floors on the way to wash my hands ane slow service they recvd a great tip for outstanding food and smiles haha|this is the first allyoucaneat steam table takeout chinese food place ive ever been to and i have to say the experience was interesting forget about getting enough of your favorite dish  you can have as much as you wantthe food itself consisted of all the standard offerings you find at a chinese food place like this chow mein rice broccoli beef orange chicken kung pao chicken and the like the food was all pretty goodanother cool part is that they offer and all you can eat salad bar when you dine in that has salad obviously fruit and a few other healthier optionsthe restaurant itself was clean and looked new they have a big screen tv which happens to be excellent for watching monday night football i i enjoyed some of the game as i devoured many portions of food the bathrooms were also clean and were in good working order overall if i lived nearby i would probably go here all the time for fast food chinese|this place should be in a portlandia sketch in a good way you have to go down a sketchy alley into an unmarked door down into a basement which is hilarious and apropos to the whole vibe you feel transported to a grandmas basement circa   complete with weird thrift store wall decor and photos of anonymous children drinks were surprisingly cheap for downtown hipster bars  for beers and well drinks the house cocktails have great names eg janet napolitini and are creative with ingredients for some old stand by cocktails kicking up up flavor a notch these run around  food is supplied by shortleash hot dogs which is a plus i had fried pickles which were delicious though i wish they were dill not sweet the bar was out of control packed by  pm and you have to throw elbows to claim your space in line i appreciate that there is a full bar with domestic foreign local and micro brew options you want nasty old bud light they got it you want some over hoppy ipa from a microbew that youll pretend to like to impress your friends they got it|been eating ll since i was a kid in hawaii had garlic shrimp and it was ok shrimp were battered with garlic sauce drizzled on top mac salad always on point and many varieties of hawaiian suns aloha|well its a movie theatre it honestly looks like every other regal theatre i suppose it feels a little newer and cleaner some of the theaters are quite large and can hold a huge crowd the bathrooms werent a mess the staff were nice the concessions staff were quick im not sure theres much else you can ask for in a movie theatre in sum this is a nice one and a worthy place to see a film|the food wasnt bad but it isnt a place to take a family my sons and i  of us have been here several times but the prices are too steep for a family each time it was at least a  bill for lunch thats my only real complaint not like we were ordering drinks and deserts we werent the sliders are great big points on those the burgers were a bit greasy but what can one expecti think the chef ought to try umami burgers in la fries were fine too noisy though  but it is s sports bar i think the open bay concept simply help amplify the noise|located near unlv seems to be  solid lunch option for students and staff many other reviews mention the lunch combos but either theyve done away with that or its not available on weekends because i arrived to menu of madetoorder entrees i liked that there were so many vegetarian options but without my favorite saag paneer available or tikka masala for the nonveg options i chose the special of the day lamb curry with the cumin rice and a samosaservice was polite food was made to order and packed up for takeout price  was reasonable for the portion size i asked for a  on their spice scale  and found it quite mild but the curry sauce was thick and there was ample lamb food had a little more grease than i had expected and i poured some off of the curry rather than ingest it samosa was just okay quality is better than some of the other studentfocused places on this side of the street|i ordered the duck which is a must for this restaurant the skin is really crispy and the sauce is sweet|us fries is a cool spot to hangout at mill ave on crazy nights they have awesome food that will fill you up real quick cant seem to get myself to eat there as much as i want to because the food is so rich that you get tired of it quickly either way the food is a great the place is great and the owner tom is great|ive gone to flos numerous times with various friends in general we have always had a positive experience prosdecor is nice and modernhappy hour from  to pmwith half price drinks and appetizerslunch menu for smaller entrees at around you can choose white or brown rice and they let my husband substitute noodles for ricemost of the entrees me and my friends have ordered were greatbus boys are really attentiveconspot stickers are not very goodspring rolls are hit or miss sometimes great sometimes oily literally dripping oilwait staff are hit or miss sometimes i have great service other times they are inattentive and make me feel like i am not valued and a bother|i really like flos i always try to hit the one in north scottsdale when im in the area so i was ecstatic that they opened a location in tempe the whole family went tonight the restaurant is spacious and beautifully appointed and the food was very good as always but the service was appallingmy husband and i took separate cars so i arrived before him with two of our children when we walked in we were told they didnt have a table just like that we dont have a table right now no offer to put me on the waiting list nothing i had to prompt the guy as to what happened next he said to take a seat they were cleaning a table then a girl followed up and told me it would be  minutes because they were clearing a table we got seated in fairly short order though so that was ok our server took awhile to come over now understandably my husband and other daughter werent there yet so i didnt get too fussed he took our drink orders and said hed stop back to get our order when our party arrived my husband and daughter got there and sat downthe waiter walked by us about  times and didnt even acknowledge that he saw the rest of our party he then came over plunked my drink on the table and walked away again without asking my husband and daughter if they wanted a drink then he proceeded to walk past us about  more timeshe finally came over to take our order he didnt listen to my husband and put in the wrong orderour food came out very quickly but we had to send my husbands back so the short version is food was good service was bad im sure ill be back but this was disappointing|therapy has a great vibe going for it  the staff are buttoned up in fancy vests theres  large screen tvs at the bar and the restaurant pulls off an upscale industrial aesthetic my beau and i decided to stop at therapy before a concert on a sunday night around pm the restaurant on the first floor was empty aside from a few people sitting at the bar we were immediately seated and our orders were taken promptly but service after that kind of fell flatportobello mushroom burger  between a choice of this and macaroni and cheese the burger won the menu doesnt specify whether this entree comes with a side so i asked the waitress if the burger came with fries she said it usually comes with a salad but substituting fries would be no problem score nobody wants that rabbit food anyways p the burger tastewise was alright  it could have been kicked up a notch or two flavor wise the fries were warm and had the perfect texture but likewise were pretty flavorless we added salt   chimichurri steak  my husband said the steak was alright and that it filled him up despite appearances this is an a la carte menu item service the manager brought us our entrees and opened the door for us as we left so he was awesome our server was mostly absent though it was a struggle trying to get refills and the check another annoyance was that the table was sticky and left a gross film on my phone cover the real killer here for us was the service the place was practically empty so i dont see how the service could be so dismal maybe eating at the bar is the way to go hereyelp  challenge  |overpriced small sushi and short staffed causing long wait food wasnt anything special|hidden in a little strip mall in tukee angry crab did not disappoint the unique experience included wearing a bib eating off a table and graffiting up some walls however the best experience was definitely the food our table of two ordered one pound of shrimp one pound of snow crab legs both trifecta style and  heat and a basket of fried shrimp with fries all of which was devoured with much gusto the  heat had a nice kick and comes highly recommended if you like it spicy the surprise star of the meal were the french fries i could not stop clawing at them cajun seasoning ftwthe service was also excellent our server dawn made sure my water was topped off while i was hastily scarfing down shellfish i hope more restaurants like angry crab scurry into ahwatukee|overall the items i had were ok  the ribs were tender the potato salad and mac and cheese was great  the baked beans tasted ok but the texture was kinda strange  like it was maybe undercooked  the muffin tops were also a little dry  my biggest issue was the burnt ends and brisket  i was disappointed to find chuck steak used instead of brisket meat  also no smoke ring to be found and the meat was dry  since they used chuck the burnt ends were basically just big chunks of chuck and not really burnt and not smoked  im gonna hope that they ran out of brisket and baked or grilled a chuck roast in a pinch  ill give it another shot cause the ribs and sauces were good  ask before you order brisket|tough place to find but worth the effortsimple menu and done rightif youre a fan of all things hot dog youll really like this place please people behind the counter were super friendly|love the variety of grilled cheese sandwiches|food i am not vegan or vegetarian or even remotely closei am a skeptic of any mexican inspired food that claims to be both delicious and animal free since my compatriots love to eat even the ugliest part of an animal call me converted the potato taco was delicioso i had no idea that potatoes could taste that way witchcraft every single pastry i have eaten here has been perfect they could sell this stuff in high end grocery stores and they should because this is america and our bellies demand it specifically  the sea salt mexican wedding cookies  the dulce de leche filled cupcakes with meringue are delectable i havent eaten anything else here so once i have i will come back and update i usually give five stars for repeat performances ambience this restaurant is in a beautifully restored house in a historic neighborhood so there are little nooks and crannies to explore both in and out of doors here the decor is relaxed clean and tasteful dog friendly porch included there are theme nights with djs and sweet music so i am looking forward to attending one of thosenote i think it is important to keep expectations in order here the bar is small but mighty as is the staff good things come to those who wait so remember youre not at mcdonalds the selections are proportional to the size of the whole operation which is a bit on the smaller side i say do a few things and do it well so i am a fan of a small restaurant any foodie worth their salt knows that a page menu is a bad sign though the menu is small it is varied it can get a bit crampy at the bar when you are ordering during high traffic times so you might want to claim your stake at a table and take a menu with you to decide then pop up to the bar to order when youre ready|this is not the place for your daily donut fix  this spot is for tourists only the donuts were overprices as expected  i will state that they have a variety of specialty donuts but not much in the way of the classics  again this is not the place to be getting a dozen for the office  the coffee was bad and strong strong i love bad not so much  the cashier was very warm and friendly and notched two stars for the place  this is a place for tourists or someone who happens to be in the area and needs a donut|ill preface this by saying that i was born and raised in the midwest and as such my knowledge of seafood is pretty limited im working on it i went here for dinner recently with a group of  we had to wait a while for our table but we sat at the bar shared some oysters im a total newb when it comes to oysters but i loved them and had a couple of drinks so i didnt mind service was friendly both at the bar and at our table though maybe a tiny bit on the slow side in their defense it was pretty busy we couldnt commit to a bottle of wine but i was pleased with the selection of wines available by the glass i ordered the mixed grill for dinner everything was fantastic oh god the scallops were especially amazing except one of the fishes i think it was the wahoo but cant remember for certain was pretty dry|we were at red rock casino to experience the new star wars movie and afterwards wanted a bite to eat but nothing extravagant we had dined at yard house and lucilles before but were in the mood for something different after reviewing our options we chose salutewe were promptly greeted and whisked to a table the location wasnt great but since the restaurant wasnt busy it was a fine very small table for two in the middle of the high traffic area of the restaurant later in the evening  servers drove by in rented handicapped scootersi guess it was the evenings entertainmentour server mike was engaging and assisted us in making our selections he assumed we wanted tap water but we ordered a big bottle of pellegrino to start we didnt order anything outrageously expensive or unique we both wanted caesar salads  each to split the seafood risotto  and  glassed of sangiovese  each  the salads arrived and they were perfectly sized and delicious we had to ask for fresh cracked pepper and the server who brought it didnt know how to adjust the coarseness of the pepper no wine arrived mike came to the table and said it looks like something is missing didnt you order wine we reminded him of our selection and he said that the bartender was opening a new bottle fine we enjoyed our salads our table was cleared and the entree arrived split on  plates very nice it was good the risotto was cooked nicely the calamari was tender and in perfect bitesized pieces we each got  shrimp  small clams and a few tiny bay scallops the sauce was tasty but sparse still no winemike finally came to check on us and we mentioned the wine again we promptly received  glasses it was a nice wine but not sure that it was exactly what we ordered we finished and mike brought us our check i was disappointed that the wine wasnt taken off the bill i asked the hostess for mike he promptly came to the table i diplomatically explained my displeasure and he quickly took care of taking the wine off the bill for us we tipped  in cash on the original amount because thats the right thing to do we had a departing conversation with mike and explained that we were locals this was our first time here and that we would like to come back to try the tableside pasta|awesome wings clean place burgers pretty goodnice place to chill and watch sports|overall i am a fan of this place it is a super close walk to heinz field also has a ton of tvs so you wont miss any of the game no matter where youre sittingalso the food is pretty on point i ordered the meat packer burger which i was not a huge fan of i feel like it just didnt have a lot of flavor i think next time i will try the create your own burger all burgers come with a side of hand made there potato chips they were pretty good but i ordered a side of ranch dressing to help the flavor a little bit and that cost me  i think its dumb when restaurants charge for dressings unless someone is ordering  of them to go i also tried the caramel pretzel milkshake i did really enjoy that it was a perfect balance of salty and sweet just like the description says their whipped cream was very creamy and not watery which i feel like a lot of places have that issue this is not the only location for burgatory i do enjoy their extensive list of creating your own burgers and their milkshakes taste fresh worth a go if you are a burger and milkshake fan your check will come with a fortune cookie i thought that was really neat until i opened it and all it said was buy the person on your left a milkshake  so kind of cute but overall wasnt as awesome as i originally thought|the food is good in quality and quantity for its price it will not he the best thai food you ever had but it is a nice lunch choice for your workdays|pretty good the food was better than outback and may even be cheaper happy hour starts at |first time here for lunch and it was delicious i enjoyed the lunch buffet   it had many options to choose from very friendly staff and a nice environment too i prefer my indian food to be more spicy but i understand that they needed to keep it more neutral for the buffet i will definitely come back|im a burger girl i love burgers if i could i would eat them every day so it was necessary that i try shake shack came here while shopping at downtown summerlin on a sunday walked in and there was no line loved the decor this place has a cool ambiance the menu was pretty extensive since it was my first time here i kept it simple and ordered the double shack cheeseburger fries and a strawberry shake my bf got the double burger with bacon and red peppers fries and a chocolate malt the cashier was very friendly and informative when it came to our questions our order was over somewhat high for burger place but i do like that they use hormone free meatsdidnt take very long for our food to be ready which was a plus my burger was awesome i got extra sides of the shack sauce to dip my fries in loved the crinkle fries perfect mix of crispy outside and soft inside only downside was that i really wished they had ranch i love ranch with my friesbut what can you do my bf really enjoyed his burger and thought the peppers perfectly complimented the meal my strawberry shake was delicious i wish it was bigger my bf wasnt too impressed by his chocolate malt he thought mine was better we are big luv it fans so were picky when it comes to custard shakes  overall everything was good the price was a huge turnoff if i ate alone it would be almost  and i wasnt too happy about there not being any ranch this is definitely a place worth trying|first of all let me just say that the tacos are awesome ive gone twice and tried  different kinds the mexican corn on the cob and the queso dip are great too however the rice and beans are bland bland bland id definitely give it a higher rating if it werent so expensive  individual tiny but delicious tacos a half order of the queso dip with chips and a regular size fountain drink should not cost |stopped in here when i was in the neighborhood i had the carne asada  taco special and it was very good much better than i expected my portion was just fine  i will definitely be back|i ordered the  taco special  with two carne asada tacos and one california taco they were all excellent especially the california one it is a bit pricey but you get bang for your buck the tacos are pretty big you get beans rice and a large drink my recommendation is too add a little more decor and ambiance to the inside its location is great and has potential to be more appealing to the pubic|i was pleasantly surprised by v pizza they are a build your own pizza company aimed at the lunch crowd and people on the go you get to choose from  types of crusts white wheat or gluten free you get to choose from  of about  sauces then top it however you see fit with any number of their fresh toppings they pop it in the oven then about  minutes later you are out the door with your freshly made personal pizza all in all you are in and out in about  minutes the thing that i appreciate is that they not only offer a gluten free option but its good my girlfriend is gf and she ranks this as the best gluten free pizza shes had we can get  pizzas loaded with toppings one gf and one regular for about  which gluten free pizzas are usually very pricey and im not a huge fan of them so v offers an options that we can both enjoy|so we traveled from glendale to tempe a min drive to try this place the decore was nice and i like how you can see the open kitchen but it was a really small place they made the most of the space they were given but the set up was all wrong on to the food so we ordered the tonkastsu ramen which is what we always order when going to a ramen place here it was ok the meat wasnt as tender as we are used to and the broth was lacking that saltiness and the soup spoon didnt seem like a soup spoon at all but a wooden flat utensil that has no purpose ill just have to wait for another place to attempt to do ramen that is worth a min drive|tampopo ramen s mcclintock drivetempecompanion and i had lunch at this new restaurant having lived in tokyo for a while i am more than slightly familiar with ramen shops good tasting filling steaming hot bowls of wonderful noodles with all sorts of accompaniments being loudly slurped down by satisfied customerstampopo has one of  imported noodle machines in the us and one can immediately tell the difference between their noodles and everyone elses the noodles have a definite toothy character to them and a distinct flavor that is exactly like one is back in tokyo this was the start of a wonderful bowlwe started off with two appetizers first was takoyaki  small batter balls with a bit of octopus in the center covered in what appeared to be unagi sauce along with bonito flakes on top the only thing missing was a bit of japanese mayonnaise which is usually found on takoyaki served in japan second was a hirata bun which is a steamed bun filled with pork a few veggies and mayo unfortunately the mayo had been mixed with what i think was a large amount of togarashi spice and was all but inedible for both of us this was very unjapanesenext was the ramen bowls companion ordered the standard tonkatsu ramen which comes with a slice of roast pork a medium soft boiled egg black wood fungus bean sprouts scallions and sesame seedscompanion loved the ramen and found the egg to be perfectly cooked to a soft but not runny stage there was so much food in the bowl that companion could not finish itfor myself i ordered the same dish but made with the rich broth which is more concentrated than the regular i also ordered kakuni braised pork belly which is served on a separate plate as well as kaedama which is an extra portion of noodles the idea is that you finish the items in your bowl but save most of the broth then you add the kaedama portion of noodles to it and you have a second bowl of ramen though minus the extra ingredients in honesty i could have done without the kaedama as my eyes were bigger than my stomach and i ended up not finishing my bowl about the only thing missing from the establishment that you get in japan is the loud slurping of the soup we also tried the japanese cream melon soda it was delicious and should not be missedthe restaurant was spotlessly clean for those who might think that this is just a fad it is worth noting that most of the customers were asian and really seemed to enjoy the food service was quick and excellent with our waiter providing commentary when neededthis is one restaurant that will be getting a lot more of my personal business as it brought back memories and flavors from living in japan highly recommended stars for cleanliness service and quality and quantity of food|nice little bakery in the tourist district  i only had a coffee which was neither remarkable or terrible  the pastries are nicely presented  for lack of a better term the store is very pretty|i came upon them on yelp of course as i was searching for some grubi was starvingloli got some fried tofu and they were a  for me i love fried tofu and these were delish fried to perfection and sauteed with a little jalapeno peppers they gave them just that perfect little kick   then i got the stir fried udon noodlesthese were flavorful udon noodles stir fried with cabbage and onions  i got this dish with chicken and their chicken had little bits of cartilage still in the chicken  did not make for yummy chewing  as i was spitting out a lot of chicken with cartilage  towards the end i was just eating the noodles and skipping the chicken  minus  star for the all the cartilage that i found in the chicken i also got their drunken noodles  these were a tad bit on the too dry side and i was really missing the basil flavor in this  i also got this with chicken and the same issue  i just ended up not eating the chicken again  brew tea bar has them totally beat on the flavor of the milk teas but when i am hungry and wanting a milk tea  i will probably come here so that i can kill  birds with one stone    at least i am not having to drive all the way to chinatown for some decent asian grub  lol   just for the convenience factor  don my second visit i got the drunken noodles again but this time i got it with fried tofu  it was a special request  and they were able to meet my needs    yes i went back a second time and got the dish that i did not like as much to see if i had gotten it on an off night as i love drunken noodle  well apparently i had  as the flavor was much improved and i could actually taste hints of the basil running through the dish  it is a dry noodle dish but this time  there was still a little moisture so that the flavors really came through  this was not the best drunken noodle that i have ever had  but it was pretty darn good  i also got a breakfast musubi  a musubi with spam friend egg and bacon  need i say more  whos got some bacon love    lets just say that i ate it the next day for breakfast and it was delicous  but then again  it had bacon    and just for the ppl who are bacon fans  this was not your think crispy bacon  this actually had some meat on it  yay    staff was completely friendly    both times i was there  very friendly and very helpful  so overall i gave them  stars  i am definitely looking forward to going back trying some of the other dishes on their menu  |pretty clutch bubble tea place in oakland the tea wasnt mindblowing but i appreciated that they are probably one of the few locations in pittsburgh that lets you choose your sweetness levels and a lot of other factors fun place to hang out with friends|wait staff was very friendly and service was fast  food was fairly good but sauce options are all centered around vinegar or mustard based  even the lexington style sauce was vinegar based i guess they may be referring to lexington county in sc   definitely not lexington nc style brisket was pricey  for  thin strips  flavor was good but was a tad tough  the bbq nachos appetizer was good i had a free coupon for them not sure i would pay  to get them again hushpuppies were good onion rings had a spicy batter with an aftertaste that is hard to describe daughter said the mac  cheese was good|just drove by this place and decided to stop by looks like they are just getting started but the food was good i would defiantly recommend i forgot my yelp coupon so the price was a liltle bit on the side but thats not their fault|im excited finally a local good healthy breakfast alternative in fort mill ive had two different smoothies so far and theyve both been great their juices look great and so do their daily soupschilis and salads if youre in the area you should definitely check this place out its a little pricy but its high quality plus i order a small and arent hungry until after lunch so youre getting your moneys worth|ordinary joes is the newest barrestaurant option in aspinwall they claim to be the only sports bar in the area and while im not sure if thats technically true they do have a ton of tvs so it would be a great place to catch a game if you can afford to stay here for  hours and drinkmore on that in a sec the restaurant itself is open clean and bright but not too bright and the decor is modern and sleek love the metal pittsburgh sports logo art adorning the walls they did a really nice job updating the dark and noir feeling of the spaces previous tenant marisqueira the menu is pretty standard bar fare burgers wings sandwiches with some more substantial dinner options thrown in pastas fish entrees they did a good job not overlapping their menu options too much with the bar a few doors down sams tavern the beer selection is not particularly impressive or expansive for a bar but itll probably suit most people just fine on our recent visit here i opted for some good ol chicken fingers and fries while my husband got the italian stallion burger the food was good but nothing noteworthy the chicken tenders were the exact same generic frozenfromabag variety that ive gotten other places a million times before i did really enjoy the friesthey seemed to be fresh cut and were very well seasoned my husband liked his burger but again thought it was just a burger good but not great and thats exactly what i would expect at a sports bar so i really cant complain about the food service was fast and friendly so i also cant complain about the servicethe problem is the prices i have no idea why a lot of places in aspinwall seem to be overpriced i dont know if it is its proximity to fox chapel which makes business owners think patrons will be willing to pay more i dont know if its the fact that aspinwall is not a huge neighborhood and thus lower volume necessitates higher pricing but at ordinary joes i felt like everything was priced about  too high for what you got i mean my chicken tenders and fries were  i dont even know if they even charge that much for chicken tenders at pnc park haha my husbands burger was  and he can get a better burger at burgatory for that same price and  for a bottle of labatts during a pens game no less i mean if you call yourself a sports bar i think you should probably have drink specials during the gamesthats a pretty standard move for most sports bars because otherwise at  a bottle for a fairly crappy beer there is no way im hanging around for  hours and drinking there while i watch a gamei may give ordinary joes another try sometime particularly if they decide to start offering drink specials during games but im not going to be rushing back there  stars|think greek chipotle you order a pita plate or salad then go down the line choosing your toppings very fast and quite delicious healthy yummy fast food in america how refreshing i had the vegetarian feast  hummus was yummy falafel cooked to order fresh spinach tasty tabouleh which is rather heavy on the bulgar and short on the parsley but still good soft pita and very smoky baba ghanoush a bit too smoky for me but thats just me im a saltaholic so thought everything could use a bit more but that was easily remedied  for the feast also ordered a small lentil soup which was hearty though on the sweet side for  hubby got a large soup which was not that much larger for  it was the egg lemon rice soup and as previous reviewers mentioned it definitely needs more lemon though he did enjoy it quite a it anyway he also got a chicken gyro for  does not come with any sides but you choose from many toppings and sauces to load it up loaded with chicken large juicy chunks tzatziki sauce was very good lots more of the menu to explore we will definitely be back|let me start off by saying its not all their fault and im going to start with what i liked the food was really good my husband had their special of the day it was a short rib over garlic butter grits he said it was the best short ribs he has ever had and the most tender the pub burger was good i liked how the bacon mixed in with the burger meat made it fall apart yummy everyone thought that the deviled eggs were wayyyy too salty if the salt was toned down a little it would have been much better might have just been a bad batch the mac  cheese bites were really good both crunchy and gooey  the beer selection was a nice selection of rotating crafter beers the flights were priced pretty decently here is where my first  star comes in i called not long after they opened and made a reservation for  people at  that night the girl said let me check put me on hold about  minutes came back and said that should be no problem would you like outdoor seating or in door seating i told her i think indoor would be best she said see you at      my friend go there before me and was told that they had no reservation at  for a party of  under ashley so i came in and told them i had talked to a girl that morning that told me they even had room for inside or outside i was then told well the girl that was working up front this morning went home sick she is the one who probably took your reservations ok and its not in writing anywhere i dont understand and the staff seemed annoyed with me how this is all my problem i do not understand   so even after all of this me and my  friends decided to stay and wait for a table to open up it was a saturday night and every place was going to be a wait due to holiday parties we went to the bar and got some beers and flights the bar tender was very nice and patient with us as some of my friends were not familiar with craft beers and had to do some sampling after we were seated everything went very smoothly the service was nice the food was good and so was the beer my second  star is because the owner was there i even heard him say he was going to wait on a table in my experience a managerowner should have come to us and talked to us maybe apologized for what happened i dont need anything for free but at least come and speak with me the only person who spoke with me about the entire thing was the young hostess who i felt bad for because its not her fault i hope that a lot was learned from this mistake however i will be back i really loved the atmosphere very chic modern and a little bit rustic it is very small but i dont mind that when you walk in to the dining room you see what i think was about  or more long bench seats and bench type tables right behind those theres a large bar with lots of bar seating both on the inside and outside of the bar they had a cute little patio on the other side of the bar where we ended up sitting they had heat lamps that worked very well and kept us pretty warm a few lights and plants outside i enjoyed a lot of things about this place so i hope to come back and give this place  stars but as of right now i am a little embarrassed and upset that i told my friends from out of town i had made these plans only to end up looking a little foolish it ruined the experience a little bit|so this is a mixed review the waitress was not good we sat at the sushi bar and everyone was getting service except for us at about  minutes of waiting we talked about leaving the guy making the sushi saw that we hadnt had anyone to see us he got our waitress and got service they gave us a free night time appetizer for the wait the popcorn chicken is really good we had sashimi and a couple of rolls the food was very good we had to remind our waitress that we got soup overall everyone was very nice and welcoming the food was so good that it is  worth another try we will go in the evening nice atmosphere no low sodium soy sauce but they are new|this is a tough one i really wanted to give them a better rating i ordered the shrimp tempura udon noodle bowl noodles were very chewy i sent it back and ordered the  cup taiwanese chicken instead the chicken coating was gummy and the dark meat inside was very fatty it arrived lukewarm as the replacement for my previous dish my daughter loved the chefs choice sushi she ordered it came with a california roll the hub had veggie fried rice he liked it because it was moist and not greasy they shared korean fried chicken wings which they said were very very goodon a previous visit i did try the veggie bun with crispy tofu and that is by far my favorite right now the atmosphere is mostly ahead of the food that i have tried so far id probably come back to the veggie bun but thats about it|i ordered a sea salt green tea with  mini boba and  regular boba the boba were both chewy and just right you could actually play around with the mini boba lol they gave you a lot of sea salt creme on top however its kinda sweet for me so i would definitely ask for less sweet next time also i dont really feel the taste of green tea in it not sure if they made it from real brew tea and its more like a regular milk teai would come back and try another drink thou|familyowned boba shop from florida made its arrival in las vegas just last week they are located directly across from student union making it a convenient place for a quick boba fix or study session atmospherewalk in and you will immediately notice this cool instagramworthy graffiti artwork on the right wall place is modern and simple with few tables and wooden bench along the wall menu is displayed on three led screen above the counter with a tiny font making it difficult for people with poor vision like me to see what they have they also sell some shirts with printed logo which i believe are on sale for  representservicei was warmly greeted by a lady and a gentleman both super friendly and helpful they were able to help me decide which drink to get drinkmy usual drink to test any boba shop is regular milk tea or jasmine milk tea but after talking to the friendly people here i somehow ended up with a large honey milk tea with sea salt cream and boba it came out to be  for their oz im usually not a fan of sea salt cream because it is a lot milkier than just a regular milk tea but sea salt cream here wasnt too thick or overwhelming drink itself was really sweet for my liking so i would order this less sweet next time boba here has al dente texture and is marinated in longan honey and brown sugar sadly i didnt taste any honey or brown sugar since my drink was honey milk tea but i enjoyed the texture of it they also have mini boba which is rare to find in vegas boba scene as far as i know tapioca express is the only other place to have it conclusiongood vibe good drink good boba i will be back again real soon menu is limited right now since they are still under soft opening but seems like they are going to expand their selection most likely adding white gourdwintermelon make sure to grab their stamp card and stamp your way for a free oz drink|thanks as always to rachel and the pittsburgh yelp team for securing tickets for us to the nutcracker the hubby and i planned a fun evening around the event starting the evening with appetizers and drinks at sonoma and ending with dinner and dessert at butcher and the ryei have only been to the nutcracker a couple other times during my life once as a little girl and another time in college and was really looking forward to attending for the third time i wish that i could say the show lived up to my expectations but to be perfectly honest it did not for me the bright spots of the performance were the snow king and snow queen the arabian dancers and the fun pittsburgh references such as the large clock and the party guests i struggled with the pace of the show as it began to feel long to me especially in act i and also with the very softly projected prerecorded music maybe the music was louder closer to the stage but from row r on the main floor i could more easily hear a number of whispered conversations and show commentary occurring around me than i could hear the actual musici love attending plays and musicals but must admit that i would have been disappointed to have paid seat to attend this show i have really enjoyed attending both a musical christmas carol and the holiday pops in the past and would prefer to return to them  at a lower cost  in the future versus coming back to the nutcracker|doh korean bbq is a new ayce kbbq on the southwestwest side they are part of the same restaurant group as doh sushi tofu hut and j

includes everything for dinner  plus rib eye i chose lunch this time but i would like to come again to try the dinnerswhat i noticed first doh is using the more modern vents that more places are switching over to a smaller fan that sucks up the smoke that is adjustable rather than the old fashioned hoods that creates a lot of noise after ordering the food quickly started rolling outthe banchan was good and their kimchi is very good aged correctly the steamed egg came out and it was good as well nice and fluffy without being watery my meats then started coming out the brisket is excellent as well as their beef tongue i thought their bulgogi is good not at the gen level but good nonethelessthe service was excellent with my server asking if i needed anything and asking if everything is good which it waswhile tofu hut has been declining in service and food quality progressively through the years im glad to report that doh shows that a brand can reinvent themselves oh

loved the slaw  the sandwich was moist and a touch spicy  his fries left a lot to be desired i got the pulled pork with ribs both were moist the ribs were ok but the flavor was lacking for me the mac n cheese and collards were great coconut cake was deliciousthe food deserves a four the girl who took our order made it a three  she kept getting confused then she forgot to add the delivery fee|this place is so special and we are so lucky to have it in pittsburgh our table wasnt ready when we got there  so they took us upstairs to the bar we had not  been here in years so seeing the bar upstairs was brandnew to us the cocktails were fantastic while we were up there we met the owner and he made some recommendations to us you have to get a meatball appetizer to split with the table  four of us split one and it was plenty they had littleneck clams on special and they were done absolutely perfectly  our husbands got veal parmesan and loved it we also had beans and greens appetizer it was delicious  next time i would probably get it without the sausage it was delicious but im not much of a sausage personthere were so many other things that we couldve ordered it was hard to decide you really feel like you are at someones house when youre eating there i would only want to sit in the front room to see the kitchen  we still were able to bring our own wine there like so many years ago we will be back again very soon if you have never been here you definitely need to go and  if you havent been in a while you need to get back there|im still a fan but something is starting to change here and not for the better the last two times ive bought from here ive been a little disappointed i got some hoagy rolls that were dense and tasted flat ive had better from sams club today i stopped and asked for some rustic italian and what i got was a regular italian loaf and it was only soso it was only slightly better than any other place that bakes its own italian like shop n save maybe the store clerk gave me the wrong bread and i hope so because i have loved this place for years and i hope they arent just making for the restaurant trade now|very delicious meal my husband has been here before but it was my first time the food and service was wonderful very nice casual and inexpensive place well definitely be back|im not normally an espresso drinker but the one i had here was lovely and ridiculously strong the smokiness and smoothness of the drink was great the ambience of this place wasnt fancy by any means  its one of those authentic italian espresso places where a lot of older folk come to chat and catch up it had this diner vibe but of course without the diner food|mon aimee chocolat carries a wide variety of different candies some are imported from different countries a chocolate bar can range anywhere from a couple of dollars to almost  depending upon where it is from the sell other things there such as cookies but candy is their specialtythey even have a counter where you can have a box made up from looking through a glass shelfthey have relativity cheap candy too if you just want some last minute stocking stuffers  i asked a clerk for advice on what to get for my daughter who loves milk chocolate i ended up getting her some white chocolate covered pretzels and a milk chocolate bar from columbia im sure she will like it since i was stuffed from lunch i decided not to indulge any further for now but i know this is one place i will most certainly return to when the occasion warrants it|mike feinberg is the go to place for not only all your steeler needs but for all your party needs as well whether you need those last minute stocking stuffers celebrating a bridal shower or a party in general mike feinberg has it and all at very reasonable prices to bootthe place today was flooded with steeler fans since we have a late home game today out for the latest and greatest of our team others were they getting last minute holiday gifts  i just browsed since i had already completely my shopping but wanted to get an idea of what they hadyes parking will be a problem but they are centrally located in the middle of some of the best shoppes and eateries along the strip check them out if you get a chance|bartender needs to tighten up his false sense of righteousness otherwise place is a cool hole|great selection of rare items you need to make a variety of japanese  chinese foods large freezer selections the odor in the place is overwhelming i will be back when i need spring roll or lumpia wrappers staff was friendly  answered my questions we didnt stay long  see everything because they didnt have several of the items i needed to make pho|oh yes that cornbread with butter was so good  yummmmmother than that my friend and i both got the fried chicken with two sides  the fried chicken was pretty solid as was the potato salad  the mac n cheese was alrighti feel like i always get excited to have mac n cheese as a side dish wherever i go but its hardly ever amazing when will i learn to give that upanyways the service was quick and friendly  it was pretty packed here but there was luckily no wait on a saturday night|great services very polite waiters good food the tomato basil soup is tasty and hearty highly recommend it|great environment and excellent servicing to customers well lit making it perfect lighting and enough to fit alot of parties food is overpriced for the portion youre getting the average chinese restaurant is cheaper with same quality taste will give a second try|lucky we were there earlier so did not wait food was good and it was fun to look at chef cooking in front of you|sometimes when youre feeling a little thirsty head over to frugal macdoogals you cant beat the pricing here but make sure you pay with debit or cash to get the biggest discount or you might as well go to your local abc store they have a beerwine and liquor section with a lot of options but dont expect to get any local or speciality beers here most of their options are just national selections which is a bummer living in an area with so many nc craft beers on the bright side everything seemed to be in stock i would only come here if i have to buy a large order for a party other than that im better off with going to abc or total wine and more|after visiting cobblestone once every few months for the last several years i stopped by for an ultimate clean  exterior clean buff and shine with a thorough interior wipe down and good vacuumthe service here is star all the way every employee i have ever dealt with has been courteous polite and always asks about trouble spots or areas that need extra attentioni got all of that this service trip but unfortunately it took them two times to get the car completely clean bug spots stood out on the front end and moon roof the interior was hardly touched etcthe second time around the employees promised to completely rewash the car it was better but wasnt quite thorough enough for me the worst part was a big puddle of product that was sprayed on my leather seat but never wiped down so by the time i caught it it had dried in to dry white chemical cleaner residue if it were to have been resolved properly the first time this easily would have been a  star review|customer off  on since   i was pleasantly surprised today with my massage therapist after experiencing turn over the past few years with therapists i loved  giva was wonderful and also a very caring individual  i have really missed sylvia was awesome and left about a year agoi had a bunch of massages built up because i didnt want to chance it on a new therapist  i totally lucked out today and will definitely be back soon|this place has something for everyone i think the four course meal is the most affordable way to go from what ive calculated unless you are only coming in for one or maybe two courses when you do the  course the first is a choice of cheese fondue then a salad then your choice of proteins which arrive raw and you cook them in a pot of a broth of your choice and lastly you pick your dessert chocolate fondue the meal can take up to a couple hours so be prepared with some time i enjoy coming but the price often prevents me from coming as much as id like if you follow their emails their promotions are helpful in bringing the price down a little bit|ive been living in the mesa area for  years now and had never heard of this place until last week when some of my friends who are mesa lifers brought it up and couldnt beleive that i had never been several friends joined the conversation and all said that this was a famous local spot in mesa and that they had the best sandwiches so naturally i had to check this place outand it definitely lived up to all the hype  i brought my wife as well who loves sandwiches and she couldnt stop talking about how great her sandwich was ill definitely be returning|place is a dump but the sandwiches are amazing super fresh and clearly made with love eat a lot but go somewhere else to use the bathroom|i have been wanting to try this place and now that i have its going to be added to my go to place for chinese since moving to the area its been very hard to find any decent fair priced restraunts that arent chains my only complaint was that the food came out to fast would have liked to finish my soup  salad before the main dish came the lunch prices were right on and will be returned often|always go here for pedicures and jell nails wonderful team of professionals and they do a great job|met a friend here on a saturday night for dinner we were pleasantly surprised that it was happy hour we ordered the meatball sliders  calamari from the hh menu the sliders are delicious but the calamari was a little rubbery for my entrees i ordered the mushroom ravioli with cream pesto sauce and my friend ordered the shrimp marinara both dishes were delicious the ambiance was lovely ill be back|one of my favorite pita jungle locations  great service large space and as all the other pita jungles great food i just wish the steamed muscles were on the main menu waitress suggested the baklava bread pudding and it was very good|i got the rib steak tasty and tender ambience was nice service was right on a few tweeks here and there and it would have been five stars like nothing really to drink for someone who does not drink alcohol and its way to dark  but ive been going to the keg for years and i do really enjoy the place|not sure where all the negativity comes from about this placemy kids and i were forced out of our condo due to a flood and were put up here for a few nights booked last minute and got a great price on the room upon arrival the clerk was extremely courteous the lobby was clean the parking lot is monitored with security cameras and plenty of lights room was immaculate and well stocked tons of storage space safe in the room iron and ironing board in the room fridge microwave coffee maker and coffee as well breakfast was actually much better than i expected scrambled eggs bacon sausage potatoes toast and english muffins tons of pastries and a waffle maker juices and coffees milkfree wifi computer provided  hours in the lobby snack bar in the lobby overpriced but thats to be expected pool area with hot tub  seemed clean easy access to the  and a bunch of places to eat down the street from the hospital if needednot sure what else is expected for a place thats less that nighti mean comeon peeps|its dark and divey with a dash of homeliness  it seems like everyone knew each other there  that place where everybody knows your name if you go take a friend along makes you look less lonely  the waitress and bartender were quick to serve with a smile|this ariba location is not the best option for mexican food but its fairly cheap  dinner plates and the servers are consistently friendly i like that they are open late on sundays and have decently fast service|cucina tagliani has been my favorite italian restaurant for years though i do feel like there has been a dip in quality over the last year or two their core basics have remained the same since they were just one location on th avenue but i feel like theyve really over extended their reach in an attempt to compete with olive garden on the next block too many constant little changes and gimmicks stick to the basicstheir appetizer menu is extensive and delicious and they have the best caesar salad in town however they really shine in the classics on their menu and thats where you should focus if youre looking to sample their best the baked spaghetti is incredible i recommend it with a side of sausage or meatballs or both if youre feeling famished and adventurous the parmesan options are great and always a family favorite i usually recommend sitting in the bar area here if you can the service is a bit friendlier and speedier on that side|our party of  arrived on a busy saturday night with a dinner wait time of  minutes  so off to the bar we go and immediately savor a couple of delicious perfectly made manhattans and a relatively obscure old drink versionrob roya great startour dinner was equally terrific albeit with a male server who was slow and inattentive to our table  thus the reason for only  starsour  different entrees were all delicious and hotswordfish petite filet coconut shrimp and kobe meat loafcant go wrong with any of these choicesthis is basically our go to place after we attend a movie at arrowhead harkins and we have never been disappointed with the food  consistency is what you get herejust maybe you may need to rope in your server occasionally and let him or her know you are a paying customer requiring great service|we love chevys and eat it a lot back home in ca now we live in las vegas and the only chevys is allll the way in henderson at the galleria a good  minutes from our neighborhood in centennial hills servers are always very nice chips and salsa is always on point only reason to not give  stars its hit or miss if the kitchen gets modifications correct we have had to send entrees back for quick fixes a few times but the servers are always very quick to take care of it|first off the kid at register has difficulty taking an orderi understand its probably your first jobi dont work there if i ask a question about your menu dont look at me stupidfood is ok at best after waiting over  min to get itsomehow a gyro fry and drink was  bucksi asked several time to the kid but deer in headlights and back n forth  timeshe also was persintent on boxing up my food idk whyoh and they gave me some prayer card on my trayi dont feel a business should push religious beliefs food is greasy get tzakiki on the side fries were fresh and food is not bad  organization  is poor and staff have difficulty when busy|been here before had dry noodles for a change always good food here what can i say|decent japanese in vegas area usuallypeople go to japanese all you can eat but quality isnt good osaka had very good quality of fish|average at best no stars off for a bad experiencewas just simply average chinese food coming from california i knew where to go in my home town now having moved to vegas i find myself looking for a good chinese food place this one came up as close by so i ordered online took almost an hour to get my food and they are really just down the street but really just didnt find the food anywhere close to what i have had my search continues in the area for a good place|i think they deserve another star this time i ordered for pick up this morning got the irish eggs benedict and the corned beef hash is on point also ordered chocolate chip pancake from the kids menu and they were so smooth and fluffy compared to what i had before|i had the pot roast sandwich and it is so delicious the bread is soft and the flavor is delicious  i am giving four stars due to the restaurant needing to be updated very badly the food is very good though|ive been at this panera location several times since its the closest one to my place its not terrible but its also not great the food is okay my favorite is their broccoli cheddar soup  their cinnamon crunch  bagel i dont like how they dont serve their soup first thing in the morning you have to wait til  or  ive gotten a couple of bagels that were burnt not extremely but burnt enough sometimes their bread is also tough however most times their food is good service is okay a lot of the workers here arent very welcoming some dont know how to smile i mean you dont have to like what you do but part of working in the food industry is being a people person overall this place is okay hit or miss|i love going to local shops and decided to give sub station a try i live right across the street so it was very convenient i ordered the small turkey and cheese sub about inches all subs come with lettuce tomato onions saltpepper oil and vinegar but i also added olives and banana peppers they had tons of toppings and sauces to pick from i think you can also toast your sub but i forgot to ask unlike other sub shops they cut their meat and cheese fresh so i was able to see my sub being make from beginning to end my sub was pretty good the bread was light and soft and the oil and vinegar mixture made it very tasty next time i want to try the spicy mayo on my sub there are tons of options here so you cant go wrong they also have daily specials for a sandwich with a drink for  i would be back for a quick lunch soon|my friends and i used to have a saying nothing good happens at selwyn after midnight expect things to get blurry if youre here late this is like a little slice of a chapel hill college bar in charlotte come for the amazing outdoor patio warning it gets crowded on nice daysnights masters weekend and when the tar heels are playing drink light beer or bourbon wear your boat shoes the food is soso in my book but thats really not why youre here pro tip michael jordan and gov mccrory are both known to pop in to selwyn for a drink act cool|what do you get when you mix a college frat party with the meyers park crowd  you get a bunch of drunk guys with shaggy hair and blue blazers pounding beers and hitting on girls while the bartenders roll their eyes  that was pretty much the crowd at selwyn on saturday nightive gotta give this place props for their outdoor space  its fantastic  huge with lots of heaters so you will have no problem staying warm while sitting outside in the winter  they also have a bunch of fire pits in case you have a group that just wants to hang out  the bartenders just dont seem like they want to be there so the service was a bit slow for a place that at the time i was getting another round wasnt even packedso here are a few reasons you want to check this place out its the end of the night and youre looking to meet someone its early in the night and you want to go somewhere that isnt crowded yet you want to relive your college frat years with the guys youre trying to find a place that can comfortably seat  people in one place you like cold beer you love a good outdoor space|this place has really good food drinks and coffee we made a reservation and then waited thirty minutes to be seated despite the fact that we saw open seats in addition this place was small portions and super expensive i ordered ravioli which was amazing but i was still starving afterwards because the plate only had six on it the price to portion size is definitely not worth it the bartender was extremely friendly however i felt the waiter didnt take my friend and i seriously because we were younger than their other customers i often felt ignored and had to ask multiple times to have my water refilled i dont think i will seek out this restaurant in the future but i wouldnt be upset if someone took me here because the food is good the price to me just isnt worth it for how small the portions are|the food was very good  the waitress was very inventive  the only thing is my i felt so sick after eating it  im not sure if its just my stomach not being able to handle it or what but i felt terrible  the staff at the front was very friendly and talkative|jocks and jills is your typical sports bar they have numerous tvs all playing different games i came to watch a specially aired college football game so we had a nice private room and our own waitress there wasnt anything special about it the food was good typical beer selection one nice thing about it is the location since it is off the beaten path its not crazy crowded like most sports bars on a saturday and sunday|food is good and authentic  atmosphere leaves a little to be desired but overall good experience|outstanding service with a smile and a tasty almond joy mocha started my day the homemade brownie was moist and satisfying i will return for more caffeinated refreshments while downtown|i want to love it but cant quite yetprosbeer selection  extensive tap and bottle list ive had the opportunity to try some great beers here including bcbs and kbs you can order flights of beer four  ounce pours if you want to try several beersingredients  locally sourced food everything has always tasted fresh i enjoy the lunch half and half option with the garden salad and soup du jour the vinaigrette dressing is tastyconsprice  a little hefty compared to other restaurants in town a beer will typically cost    a sandwich at lunch is around  i would definitely recommend bar service if you have a small party service is much faster|i booked this hotel through priceline for an interview trip and got an amazing deal very convenient locationjust a block or so from the metro line which takes you straight to the airport for  each way the hotel itself is very nice great amenities clean and great staff there are a lot of restaurants in the area as well|i stopped in for a quick beer and some food to take back to my hotel   the guinness was cold  and the shepherds pie hot  the food was decent   nothing mind blowing   one annoyance when assured by the waitress that the jalapeo poppers were not frozen  but made fresh i was not pleased to discover otherwise once back at my room they were just like every other frozen popper that ive come to despise i was tempted to walk back and return them   when put on the spot about a menu itemdont lie to me thats just annoying as hell the bar itself seemed pretty cool and probably pretty hopping on the weekend evenings|we visited lolos today and it was amazing we are from los angeles and would normally get our chicken and waffels from roscoes we went in with high expectations and lolo s was on point definitely won take that match we ordered chicken wings and waffles which were delicious my daughter ordered the oreo pancakes she said they were amazing they had koolaid and it too was amazing  the only bad thing was the catfish bignets they lacked flavor overall  stars would have been  if it werent for those flavorless bignets|i was recommended this vet by my sister and was happy with the recommendation the prices are less then banfield for the service i went for and the staff was very friendly i called ahead to see what the wait time was and was pleased to be taken back right away when i arrived the building is a bit dated but all that matters is the service and care my dog receives  i am glad to see that they are open sundays since most vets are closed on sunday i would definitely return if need be|we started out intending to go to the local ihop but they had a line out the door we came across iowa cafe right across the street and decided to give it a try it was a good choice we walked in and it was packed we were seated within a couple minutes all of us ordered an omelette it came with potatoes and choice of bread i chose an english muffin they advertise fluffy omelettes it was delicious and filling didnt finish everything because i didnt want to be stuffed the staff is friendly service was good i even enjoyed watching the football game that was on the huge tv right in front of us i would recommend for breakfast we all enjoyed our food|had the flat iron steak with basmati rice and vegetables  the meal was good but nothing memorable  might try their filet with mashed potatoes next time  very nice atmosphere and plenty of room at the bar which was nice|barros pizza has been around for years in cave creek their pizza is always made consistently and while the crust resembles a frozen pizza crust it has a thick chewy almost bread like consistency perhaps the best feature is their salad bar it is always goodand they offer nice cold beer what is never good is the incredibly inconsistent service ranging from pleasant to downright rude the staff is poorly managed clearly and has been for the years we have been going here because the kitchen is usually very busy and there is a sense of hustle going on the customers are treated more like cattle moving through the restaurant than important guests still it is difficult to complain about their pizza while rays pizza is a much better product all around and the service is much better they do not have a salad bar for this area of town these are really the only two decent pizza places for a good price|got the chorizo breakfast burrito it was ok just a little too greasy for my likings and when i say greasy i mean it looked like i killed someone afterwards i know that the chorizo is greasy but i have never eaten one this greasy ever if im ever strolling by i might give this another shot and try something else regardless i still enjoyed the service|first time here a couple of weeks ago from several friends recommendationsfriendly staff rob the bartender great guy got one of our food orders wrongwe called and they said next order on them and i am sure they will back that upwe ate the wrong dish regardless and very goodwe will be back |desiree did an amazing job   the hair cut and style are perfect for me   come early so you dont have to wait  shop is small but everyone there really is fantastic  ill be back|very close to the arizona grand resort  took basketball team there for a meal in a hurry  waitress staff helped us wonderfully with our large broken up order|a local favorite this hole in the wall serves home cooked food that does not disappoint  i orders two eggs over easy with bacon and rye toast  the food was cooked to order hot tasty and the bacon was thick crisp and flavorful just like i hoped it would be the waitstaff is very friendly and took great care of us  they chatted with everyone who came in and made them feel at homeone reminder if you go bring cash  no crest or debit cards taken here|i have been coming here for years i have not found another establishment that  compares the staff are friendly they always ask how my family members are when i come in i highly recommend them the food is great and is at a great price|i like this place because it is very low cost affordablethe room is large clean comes with a fridge couch desk hdtv cable channels coffee machine close to fremont streetand etcmy only gripe is that the wifi is slow and there is no microwave i like downtown vegas because im old school the elevator has a unique cherry scent and the carpet reminds me of fear and loathing in las vegas|im giving this place  stars because overall i love the hotel  our most recent stay was a little disappointing  we have a landry card and i was told that we would always get a room upgrade as their website even said and still says   when we went for the upgrade we were told thats not how it works anymore   now you need a certain status to get the upgrade   they did accommodate and upgrade us after a few calls and a manager coming downto a room by the elevator with a view of a wall  not part of a wall not a distant wall but literally if the windows opened i could touch the wall  if i put my head against the glass and looked left i could see the pool maintenance building   i guess thats what i get for complaining and getting the upgrade|we only went for the experience  prices are so expensive but it was cool to look around |no bad but have had much better for less the only plus was the location even though certain areas and  rooms were nonsmoking smokers still were smoking im not sure if the ventilation systems are poor but the entire hotel reeked of smoke we visited mgm mandalay bay new york new york and more and didnt have this issue by the end of my trip my eyes remained blood shotdidnt realize i had allergies to cigarettes until the stay at excalibur claritin take me awaylol|pros clean and has like  waffle irons at its free breakfast room is acceptable the appropriate sizealso there the habit is next door making tasty inexpensive food incredibly accessiblecons no lotion its vegas its dry and the towels have a funky smell they must use an odd detergent overall perfectly acceptable place to stay would stay here over other residence inns due to location and the habit|four stars mainly for atmosphere the free wine during dinner is great and the dinner salad was amazing  the actual meals are decent but not as good as other restaurants  you also get a what they call a cappuccino after dinner which is good but is basically a hot chocolate|my husband loved the coconut pancakes we were just surprised at the upcharge for turkey bacon i would not recommend the sirloin and eggs the coffee is served in heated cups and that is awesome our server joseph  was wonderful|ok so after reading the reviews i was skeptical about the hotel but liked the architecture of the building so took a chance  the hotel is fine  the staff attitude was typical for vegas which is just this side of ill never see you again so please dont talk with me  personally my experiences with the staff were positive but i think i had my expectations set prior to arrival  as for the property it was very nice and somewhat modern  i can only assume those who are complaining have never stayed at the la quinta down the street or at any of the hotels around disneyland  there are a few issues such as peeling wall paper slow wifi and the shower drained slowly but over all it was a good room with a great balcony view of the farris wheel and strip  the best part is it was smoke free and i didnt have to pack lunch for the walk to the room  breakfast was good cooked to order is always nice  overall i would have no problems staying here again and would recommend it to anyone|ive donated since college when i started organizing blood drives at our school i try to donate during holidays since it seems thats when more activity happen with tourists in town or dui accidents its a great way to give back and get some neat freebies movie and penn  teller tickets amazon gift cards blood donation promotional and hero in you tshirts the west charleston site is the ubs ive donated to for many years location is

juices in the frig oatmeal raisin and chocolate chip cookies oreos nuts and wheat thins i actually raid the canteen area before my donation when i have to sit get my vitals done bp temp pulse iron due to being a pescetarian my iron usually teeters on the  mark|i wish i could love this place a little more ownership is trying hard to be an asset to the neighborhood by providing as many resources as possible to make it useful for nearby residents it wont replace a stop at the grocery but being able to grab decent wine priced the same as total wine ie super reasonable a selection of dairy including fresh eggs and some small cafe items in addition to your usual convenience store staples is well convenientthey may not have a huge selection of brandsflavors for certain items chips sodas but i like that their prices are on par with other similar shops rather than raised for the convenience of not leaving the neighborhood they also have a small dinein area with a cafe menu though i have yet to go by when its open unfortunately at a place where great service can really make this place shine i instead consistently encounter zombielike disinterested cashiers i also find the display case of glass pipes to be in extremely poor taste and a bit of a turnoff|this bar is nicebut the service her not that good they have to make sure that the music in her need to be hiphop|good quality food but crazy wait times we waited  minutes to get a table and another  minutes to get food  so either make a reservation or be ready to spend at least two hours to finish dinner well the food quality and taste is worth the wait |spend our christmas party at aloha kitchen and service was good i love their barbecue and chicken katsu the look of the restaurant was nw and modern all and all the service was good|best bacon cheeseburger ive had in a long time  i was surprised just how good it was  better than a lot of the highend burgers  delivery is timely and the food is hot and fresh  this is my goto place for a burger for now on|i have been coming here for years i would rather give this comment privately but you dont have a comment option on your website first i would like to say i love your establishment the food is great entertainment is great and i love poker night i would like to make a comment about your waitress unfortunately i didnt get the name but she is currently pregnant i usually cut some people some slack when i see they are pregnant or clearly not feeling well but i have also had her when she was not pregnant she is very cold has on several occasions made me and the people im with feel like we are a bother twice this week has taken over  minutes to get drinks as my friends and i sat and watched her talking with her coworkers in the spot near the piano tonight was no exception after about  minutes from ordering our drinks she stopped by with nothing in her hands to tell us another waiter will come give us drinks at this time we were the only table on the smoking side being in the service industry i find this completely unacceptable i like to give people chances because everyone is entitled to a bad day but i have unfortunately dealt with her service since  i wouldnt even mind her lack of attention if when the times she did come she was at least pleasant|the tamales are very good but small  the service l feel was awesome except the couple we were with  messed up the order and the gentleman giving us our food started to argue instead of taking care of the problem  the manager took care of the issue and was excellent at his job  i would defiantly go back |i never eat in the restaurant but pick up sushi frequently every time i have ordered to go it has been awesome good quality sushi and made fresh only reason giving  stars is because the workers could be a little more friendly|great food very good wine selection although a bit limited homely style typical italian family restaurant highly recommended friendly staff and ownerchef we will go back again soon|after seeing all of the terrible groupon experiences and having bought the hibachi groupon i was expecting the worse but this place is actually pretty good the only reason for deducting a star was the fact of me calling about four times to make a reservation for dinner and the phone just ringing and ringing maybe they have a no number who knowsthe overall dinner experience was very good though we were seated immediately served very quickly and all the food was delicious im not sure if id return without the groupon but it was still a very good time|cozy atmosphere that fits well on willy st unique and flavorful food walleye is dependable also enjoy the bad breath burger west of the andes is a nice lighter option service is usually friendly although they can be understaffed when busy really enjoy the versatility of the wearycan be a good choice for couples looking for a date spot while also accommodating large groups comfortably|this used to be my go to choice for lodging in vegas the prices are fair and the upgrades are liberal however ive moved on to another property its ghetto and not in a racial waydrunk guys in cargo shorts and flip flops carrying those  ft green or red drinks zero class with their dates who have dressed to the nines yet cuss like sailors waiting for their food at mcdonaldsloud and unruly in the hallways im all for a good time but mind your manners leaving empty drinks in restrooms and leaving a mess like you are in a gas station is uncalled for unfortunate in my opinion the low rates at this iconic property have also brought the low lifes that come to town to recreate a hanger over  experience three stars to the fine staff that must endure the highrollers from trailer parks|i took my aunt and uncle here while visiting vegas last week and we loved it its my second time here and i got the steak which was a french steak i wasnt impressed bc i didnt know what to expect out of a french steak i didnt realize it would be so flat so make sure you know that before hand the souffl cauliflower was very awesome if its warm air outside on the patio so you can see the fountains across the street that might be the best part of the restaurant also its not very pricy and was easy to get a reservation in even on a friday night|the breakfast was great eggs benedict wife had spinach and goat cheese omelet really good however bacon was burnt and dining room was quite warm to  out of  people in our party hence the four stars they did turn on the ac at our request the service was exceptional for a casino restaurant i will definitely come back|awesome place great food fun atmosphere my only complaint is its a bit scary the first time you are here its fast pace and a bit confusing when you arent familiar with the menu since a lot of stuff isnt named like other places truly a one of a kind place keep up the great work guys|food and drinks were very good  waitstaff was very attentive  a little pricey for two people   that was one  drink and a breakfast meal for each|rellay good food great service grab a cookie on the way out cant wait to go back again and explore the menu|nice restaurant in the bellagio hotel  had a late night dinner so were seated immediately  service was quick and food was delicious|decent coffee shop and cigar store had a chai tea latte that was alright and an acid blondie which i appreciated get much good place to hang out with friends also its byob so keep that in mind the indoors decor is along the lines of your one dorky uncles garage packed with a variety of vintage items and hawaiian shirts the smell of cigars is rather overpowering  i wish they had a better air ventilation system after i left the establishment the smoke smell was still very strong on my clothes otherwise its a chill place to hang out definitely dont study here|hubby and i got the house meatloaf with mash potatoes and broccoli  it was delicious service was a little slow had to wait for our check but everything else was superb|our family has been at a couple of different maggianos and this one in phoenix was no different than the others  we went there for a birthday celebration and had a great time when they found out we had a celebration the waiter made sure we got extra special treatment we ordered family style and one of the chicken entrees was overcooked the waiter  with no problem whisked it away and brought us a new entree we were supposed to get a free dessert for the birthday and instead they brought us a big sampler dessert platter for the whole group  we were so full  they really know how to make everyone feel special  the only issue was it was very crowded so the tables are crammed in  we were sitting next to a walkway  which made us feel food would be toppled onto us at anytime because of all the traffic of large platters of food being passed next to our table  we made a reservation but had to wait an additional  minutes   its pretty busy on a saturday|we celebrated with my husbands sister boyfriend and all her friends when the tough mudder was in town i just pretended it was my birthday meal since it was the next day anyway they had a special four course menu going on that i was tempted to get because i really wanted steak my sister in law said i could try some of hers so i opted to get the seafood alfredo with shrimp cocktail for my appetizer when i had sampling of steak from my sister in law i wasnt impressed it was tough and had no taste i was so glad i went with the alfredo after some i freshly squeezed lemon on top of it was delightful the shrimp cocktail was a disappointment because it wasnt made traditionally it had guacamole in it i figured if i wanted it mexican style i would have opted it to be in a ceviche instead this is a beautiful restaurant but what made me sad was every person at our table about  of us all got our meal and was done before they delivered my husbands steak i know my husband always wants his steaks well done but i think they should have timed the dishes better so we could have eaten together everyone was offering him food off their plates the waiter blamed it on the cooking time of the steak and didnt really offer any sorry for how late the food was in the future it would be nice if the dishes were timed accordingly|oh brillo how the mighty have falleni remember a time  and not all that long ago actually  when the question where do you want to go tonight would often be answered with an enthusiastic brilloand now its just like the thing we want to see is being hosted here lets hope we dont have to use the bathroom all nightdo not despair  i will tell you in time why it is still worth it to come out to this relic of our yesterlvillei havent eaten there in a good while and last i did the food was yummy we havent seemed to make it during kitchen hours lately but i do remember the food fondlythe drinks eh not so much i would say stick to wine or beer if youre drinking here singlespirit mixed drinks  like a vodkasoda etc  are a pretty safe bet as well but anything past that not impressednow on to the real reason you want to come here dance nightstitle town has moved here after the closing of the shadow lounge tears this is hosted the second saturday of every month and is  before pm  after but worth every penny no matter what time you arrive the djs are fantastic j malls  gordy  maybe another guest dj or two the music is all old funk soul  rb and you will dance until you fall overthe second also fantastic dance night is second skin which is generally hosted every other month although the days of the week appear to change your best bet here is to like second skin on facebook so you can get notifications of when the dance nights aresecond skin is a gothy dancefest you dont have to be goth to love it believe me there are plenty of hipsters out there shaking it on the dance floor as well but its all really really wellcurated goth dance music postpunk new wave little bits of industrial basically if you could dance to it dressed in all black you will hear it from the wonderful erica scary  crew now that eclipse has closed and weve lost our other goth night in the city this is the event to look out for every other monththe negatives of brillo the upstairs bathroom a bathroom so heinous that the trainspotting bathroom told it to maybe clean its act up the floor will be wet its real slippy yinz watch aht there will probably not be any toilet paper someone may have used paper towels in place of the toilet paper so you may have a scary situation be warned hold it as best you can or make your way downstairs to the lessnightmareinducing bathroomson the subject of wet floors the dance floor at brillo always seems to be wet spilled drinks i guess or sweaty humans perhaps some combination of the two regardless just be careful when you are dancing your brains out that you dont slip bump your head and actually knock some brains outand it will be crowded always it will always be crowded at some point of the evening be ready for it and try your hardest to watch that your elbows dont go into someone elses dancing real estate looking at you my flaily hipster friends we can all get along in this smelly sticky slippery spaceand all the negatives will be worth it because you will dance so hard you forget they all exist|love this bar their black chip is my favorite brew along with fried green beans  wasabi ranch|three meals were great one was bad   service was great  price was fair for the location|the patio is very nice live music is fun been coming for years food is good but everything is incredibly over priced from the beer to the german bratwurst|this used to be one of favorite restaurants but i hadnt gone for like  years and went last week and the gumbo is not the same this place was what sparked my love for gumbo and southern foods in general but they lost a bit of their former touch the gumbo was overly salty but at the same time lacked flavor it was full of seafood but had no real seafood flavor i will be dreaming of their gumbo no longer but i still have hopes for their pan roast i will return at least once more before i give up on them forever|i would not have chosen to go to macs on my own  but since i was dragged there i went with an openmind  ive driven past many times but never felt any urges to check it out  as i have guessed its not the macdaddy kind of restaurant its a neat spot drinks are good and their chicken quesadilla was the best ive had in a long time  though i took a risk and venture outside of my tastebudzone i would probably not go again no harm no foul just not what my palate desires|good cheap food for vegas  make sure you bring cash because they will charge you a fee  to use your debtcredit card  they are short handed today which caused delay in drinks and food being ordered and received  not sure if i would come back|i keep going back to chicken  low mein a little  on the oily side but plenty i found flavors  and a good portion for  dollars|good food clean large selection friendly staffmy husband and i have eaten at cravings approximately  times weve had brunches and dinners weve always found the food to be prepared well plentiful both in selection as well as quantity the servers to be friendly and helpful and the establishment to be cleansome of our favorites are the prime rib chilled peeled and ready to eat shrimp crab legs roasted chicken omelette bar unlimited wine and beer and the desserts yumthey also offer ethnic choices such as cajun asian italian and othersif youre concerned about budget id suggest buying the lunch buffet and going around pm youll get some of the dinner selections as well|okay price with great service the food selection leaves something to be desired during lunch and the food itself wasnt great a lot of things were cold and tasted like it was made a few hours ago|good food service can be slow with the volume of customers they get|i usually love coming to red robin because i am in love with their hamburgers but within the last year or so ive been  when i leave the restaurant i dont know what it is about their servers theyre either amazing and personable and fun to be around or theyre awkward and not very good at their job today i had a server who was weirdly condescending towards our party when we had a question or needed clarification she would go okay well or okay but it felt like she was talking down to us maybe she has young kids at home but i didnt like when she came over to our table not a good sign server also ordered our appetizer for us we wanted onion rings since they want everyone to use those tablet things and she chose the biggest and most expensive size instead of asking us which size we wanted alright thanks those onion rings were really not worth food was great as always im a big fan of their burgers i just wonder how long ill deal with bad service until it wont be worth it anymore|this place is such a cozy cool trendy spot they have great strong drinks and scoop place to sit with a big group me and my friends have a blast here all though some nights have been really slow in there other days its hard to get a drink theyre so packed|the tv s are plentiful good beer selection food is average at best service is hit or miss our server stopped checking on our table and we had to flag her down for our bill after not seeing her for over an hour|i love coming here this is the only place i come for movies but its a shame that the bar staff is not very knowledgeable about basic drinks ie sidecar and an old fashions with the prices we pay you would think they would be awesome i will continue to come for the movies but guess ill just stick to beers until the bar staff fix themselves|stayed at the ceasars for the weekend rates were discounted because were part of the players club but look to spend at least  a night plenty of amenities restaurants state of the art gym and a mall rooms in the palace tower were ample bathrooms were huge and included a spa although there are plenty of amenities and the ceasars is a top tier hotel i dont see the value when there are other hotels with similar amenities for less|sprouts is a pretty good option for grocery stores in the area there are a lot of healthy options but you have to be careful as i have noticed quite a few products which are mislabeled as healthy options including some products which on the shelves were labeled as organic and nongmo but on the packages they were clearly neitheri was quite disappointed that they automatically start putting our purchases in plastic bags without giving the option of paper when asking if i could please use my own bag along with a paper bag the cashier rolled her eyes and gave an audible gasp of annoyancei feel like sprouts likes to pretend its loaded with all sorts of fantastic healthy options but the healthy products are really interspersed with all sorts of pretend healthy products|order nacho bell grande taco fresco style and tostoda through drive through took about  minutes window server was very nice and politd food was fresh and hot not bad for taco bell| stars  substandard dimsum dishes ordered belowordershrimp tofu  favorite dish tofu was excellentshort ribs in black bean sauce  tasty what you might expectturnip

chang fen  shrimp was juicy and tasty the rice cake itself was shrimp dumplings xia jiao  smallest shrimp dumplings ive ever seen at any dimsum spotshrimp dumplings with chives  had to actually send this back chives mightve been rotten which gave the dumplings a sour tasteon the upside service was pretty good servers do a good job of rounding the large restaurant with carts good for groups takes reservations|ive had my haircut in this salon by multiple people and its been consistently good|id give it five stars because i love me some fish tacos but im saving a perfect five star rating for something special|pretty cheap for bottle service and the music is goodall around pretty good experience they do enforce dress code pretty seriously tho|i had the pleasure of taking detours day trip to sedona  we had a small group of six in a van with a drivertour guide jojo who was knowledgeable pleasant and efficient  the tour stopped at montezumas castle then went on to sedona where we had several stops for photos of the amazing red rock formations including at the famous holy cross church we also had a lunch break in sedonas town shopping area and were provided a meal allowance and several restaurant recommendations  we had time for lunch and local browsingshopping afterwards we drove up high into the mountains where there were tall pine trees and snow and had more photo opportunities at a national park  to end the tour we stopped in one more scenic location with a beautiful view of the red rock mountains then started our two hour drive back to phoenixscottsdale  i was picked up around  am and returned to my hotel at about  pm so it was a full day  but i never felt rushed and found the spacing of this tour to be very comfortable  i would definitely recommend it and do it again|as a recent graduate of the aveda institute this is my student review of the school overall my experience fulfilled its purpose providing me the basics in order to start my career in the beauty industry however there were more than a few unpleasant qualities of the school that are important for potential new students to be aware of first the schools reception area is unbelievably unorganized some individual receptionists themselves arent bad especially jessica such a sweetheart but as a whole they do not function as they should and make no attempts to do their job better despite both teachers and students complaints they constantly give all the advanced students all the guests and give the newer students almost nothing this is frustrating for both groups of students advanced students are having to repeat simple services they have done a hundred times like retouches botanicals and manipedis rather than more complicated services they need practice with like highlights and ombres while the new students are bored all day working on manikins not getting the practice and education they paid for moving on the people in charge are often very rude to students the owner of the school john is very unfriendly he rarely ever says anything to any of the students not even a hello most students dont even find out what his name is until later on because he makes no effort to connect with us the director of the school is impossible to talk to about any issues you may have because she immediately becomes defensive and tells you why you are wrong for feeling that way or just dodging around the grievance entirely rather than listening to your issues and either explaining to you why things are the way they are or coming up with a solution to the issue despite this being a school for adults the students are treated like children and given little to no freedom and are shut down when making suggestions nearly every time they try also retail is shoved down our throats every chance they get yes retail is an important part of cosmetology but its emphasized far too much which causes many students a lot of stress particuarly because most guests thatcome to aveda come because of its cheap prices and dont have the money to spend on expensive aveda products and yet we are punished with low grades if we dont sell enough product it is also extremely demeaning that aveda advertises everywhere that guests are not supposed to tip students the students work very hard and work long days doing about  hours a week and rarely get any money to show for it in an industry where tipping is the norm no other school in the city has this arbitrary and disrespectful rule its such a breath of fresh air any time you get a guest that knows they arent supposed to tip you but does anyways because they know you deserve it especially considering how much extra work we have to do with all the massage services included with hair services on a more pleasant note the majority of the teachers are absolutely wonderful and made the experience worth it big shout outs to rubi philip jessica m anais heather ioana phira lisa f lisa m marianne and michael also shout outs to sue and nicole who work behind the scenes and do their jobs wonderfully and are always friendly to students however there are just a few teachers that will go unnamed to be respectful that often overstep their bounds and wave their authority around like a giant neon flag no matter how many times a student or teacher tries to talk to them and give them feedback they never make any effort to improve and trying to bring them up to the director results in nothing because like i said earlier she avoids attempting to resolve any grievances at all costs to end this review i will say that if you are looking to possibly attend aveda you will certainly be taught the basics of cosmetology as well as get a lot of practice on the state board test required for your license so you should pass it with ease the majority of the teachers are wonderful as well as other staff members the students in general are also very friendly and you will surely make a lot of really good friends it is not a horrible school and is likely your best option for a cosmetology school in las vegas but you should also be aware of the glaring flaws that bring the school down a lot knowing that with the way they are currently teaching new students on the floor you may not get the education you were expecting because you most likely wont be getting very many guests when you get on the salon floor and learning the basics when you should be like the older students did|i have stayed at south point many timesand i can only say great things about this placegreat choice in restaurants  from a deli to a top of the line steak housethe casino is large with many choices to playnice sports book  great  hotdogslarge pool areabowlingmovie complexsitting areafree wifiif this sounds like i like this place you are right only place i stay in vegas|it was authentic but nothing too special worth visiting again but not one the must have list|omg i love this place  everytime i go its super fun the karaoke is fun to do and the food is amazing for a bar themed establishment i plan on going again pretty soon|we have been here for lots of parties and i love the  am option for a less crowded experience the place was clean and they have added several new rides for the littler kids the food was decent  loved the sandwiches only the salad bar was disappointing because the lettuce was turning brown and wilted overall my kids loved it and wed go back|peterson helps me a lot but the girl with long messy hair is rude idk but she have that attitude that i dont like she dont smile at all i still like this store thou|dr mark has been our doctor for several years now and we wouldnt think of going anywhere else not only is dr mark the best the entire staff is friendly and knowledgeable very helpful with insurance and all other arrangements that a patient may need the only problem ive had is with scheduling and that was one time out of many visits youll find that advanced eyecare comes highly recommended by anyone whos been there|ive avoided this show for a while as carrot top always came across to me as an oddguy and more dorky than funnybut i was very much surprised with how good the show was when i saw itvery original and innovative he has done the same show or some variation of it  time or so but he seemed like he genuinely enjoyed performing and engaging the audience the one dud is the odd animal videos to start the show  that set a bizarre tone and i almost left before the curtain went up|we enjoyed the small venue and the affordable price to see the comedy hypnosis show we both were entertained and enjoyed ourselves|opens  and has wells fargo atm inside so you can feel safe withdrawing cash at night without having someone mugging you then you can do your grocery shopping as well it has a good produce area and stocks cold smartwater unlike some markets like luckys its location is on tropicana avenue just a few ticks up from the strip|excellent restaurant  ive heard wonderful things about this place and they did not disappoint  great service great food and lovely artwork|its a pretty good radio station if your a younger person they need to play a wide range of music for the young and old|after eating at boiling crab we decided to stop by and pick up some yummy korean baked goods out of all the years ive been coming to vegas i never thought to or knew about chinatown or to look for asian places to eat this bakery is located upstairs of one of the many shopping centers in chinatown they have small baskets for you to grab as many goodies as you want and even sell macaroons and single slices of a few different types of cake the macaroons were delightful and not too sweet like most macaroons well definitely be stopping by here again next time were out in vegas|the goodthe hotel is beautiful with a very nice lobby checkin is very easy and everybody that works here is very nice it is right next to the fashion show mall which is a huge plus and has easy access to the strip i got a room on the  floor just a standard room with a king bed and it had a view of the strip cleanliness is taken seriously herethe badthe bed which is the most important thing to me was as hard as a rock the mattress was very uncomfortable and i had to sleep on the comforter and use one of the robes to cover myself just to be able to lay on the bed i woke up several times during the night because of how hard the mattress was it is hands down the most uncomfortable bed that i have ever slept in at a four or five star hotel if you like hard mattresses and i mean hard like a rock you will like this for most of us that want to sleep in a comfortable bed and feel like we are being carried on pillows which is what top hotels are all about one will be sorely disappointedas an fyi i also had a chance to try latenight room service it took about  rings before somebody picked up to take the order all i ordered was a chicken noodle soup and a caesar salad the chicken noodle soup was ok but it was nothing to write home about the caesar salad was extremely disappointing and felt generic overall it was not bad yet not at all indicative of a four star or higher hotel in the way that it was presentedoverall it is a nice hotel so it should have received a total of five stars in evaluation my information on room service is just for fyi because i really dont care and dont think that a hotel should get points off for that my points off come due to how uncomfortable the mattress was and this is the type of mattress that i have seen in two and sometimes three star hotels most four and five star hotels pride themselves on the most comfortable mattress i do not plan on staying here again because i think that a comfortable bed is the absolute cornerstone of what a great hotel should be about|if youre looking for a deli that will stack your sandwich with tons of meat youve come to the right place the deli is located inside new york new york and you walk up to the counter to order i ordered a corned beef on rye with coleslaw and russian dressing the corned beef was tender and flavorful i could barely taste the coleslaw and the russian dressing wasnt very flavorful the bread fell apart because there was so much inside my sandwich so be prepared to grab plenty of napkins my hubby ordered the mile high and his sandwich was overflowing with corned beef turkey and pastrami overall a good sandwich packed with lots of quality meat|there is nothing bad in here  its true amazing bagels bakery section ive always loved their sandwiches and there omelets are so good i remember they used to be in the sun coast hotel and they had some amazing sugar free desserts i dont know if they make them anymore sad  but do go its so good |we love this place  service is always good and food is delicious  korean pancake and meat chun are my favorites|dropped in on a cold and windy vegas saturday night was seated quickly under some toasty heaters ordered beers splitting a veggie burger and sweet potato fries all is well the burger was good but the patty was thin would have liked more taste of the good stuff there goes a star hitting the boulevard  sweet potato fries are sweeeeet can be addicting decent beer selection|this is a good theater  seats are good picture and sound are good  prices are excessive but that seems to be the norm now    i get passes or matinees  but the theater itself is very good|we like their  lobster pastry  it was nice and fluffyalso tried their  fried chicken  which consisted  of chicken  breast it was  on the dry side  the sauce  was underwhelming  the lobster mac and cheese  was good but the order came out late  meal was spaced with ample  time   they comp us desert service was a little  slow we do like their  food|met with some friends from work that have eaten here before and decided to give it a go ordered the pork sandwich and was not disappointed the flavour was great and the pretzel bun was amazing one coworker got a sandwich and was asked if she wanted cheese she agreed and didnt think much of it however when we got the bill my friend was charged  for half a slice of cheese and almost  for her soda my water was never refilled and the waitress did ask how our orders were but was really contrite about it between the cost and service doubt ill be coming back again|fair   just so so    salad was ok   spaghetti with sausage al paesan was fine    margarita pizza very greasy but good   service was fine  wont rush back|my philly cheese steak was killer the bread was so soft but my boyfriends pepperoni slices were mediocre the price is right at this place|we checked this out before our dinner reservation  and i gotta say im glad we did it was awesome and the views where amazing even though we went when it was dark out we still got charged for day time rates also if you show your players card like most places the take a buck off so make sure to do that the wait wasnt long at all and the elevator is pretty huge so it can fit a lot of people in it but i think they do limit how many people are on the observation deck at one time as far as i know you can stay up there as long as you want i just have one suggestion and that is to make sure you stay for one of the bellaggio fountain shows well worth and it gives you a different perspective on the show the views are amazing and they have little slots where you can take some awesome pictures i also thought going at night and seeing all the neon would be better than a day trip up there but to each there own|this store has everything a country bumpkin could ever need in their life i however being born and raised in a metropolitan city found the store to be not of my flavor the people were nicebut from what my shopping partner told me prices are a bit outrages sooooo  stars for that and also because of the ridiculous wait time for a damn santa picture|i love this place i found it on a whim a few years ago while staying on the strip during this trip to vegas ive been twice the gluten free pancakes are amazing the service is always good and the coffee is fresh i really enjoy my food and the time i have apparently the coffee cake is great the smell is incredible thanks for having such amazing gluten free pancakes|convenient squirrel hill location with reasonable prices sushi is standard fare but nothing spectacular  decor is stereotypical chinese restaurant wait staff i friendly  clientele seem mainly student sunday lunch  id come again but not make a special trip|my wife

actually spicy  generally what they advertise as hotspicy is pretty mild but this definitely packed a kick not overpowering but genuinely hothoney flan  light creamy maybe a bit too much whipped topping but not overly sugary or chemical tastingthe not as good my wifes fundido  i forget which it was she ordered but it was basically a chimichanga with a creamy jalapeno sauce on top  it wasnt bad the chimi was crispy it was just pretty bland  it could use something else in there to provide a contrast to the cream something tangy to cut through itcost of the two entrees and dessert was close to  no drinksclose to full on a saturday around  probably busier as the night goes on|as far a quick bites and sandwich places this place is the bomb and i always come here a few times while staying in vegas for a cheap bite to eat the staff is always friendly and the service is fast i got the the thanksgiving sandwich this time and i got to say i was kind of skeptical at first but it was mind blowing and one of my favorites not sure if its always available but it should be i also ordered the chipotle chicken avocado which was awesome really for vegas standards your not going to find to many places for cheap eats that are as good as this place epically if you are looking for something fast at am there is plenty of seating available at this location and its located in planet  hollywood right by the poker room and sports book and the miracle mile shops i chose to get it to go because for some reason the hallway by the miracle mile shops always smelled really bad but in my opinion this is a must stop for a cheap place to eat in vegas you really cant go wrong with any sandwich you order|my and husband and i frequent this location often mainly friday or saturday night to my surprise theres usually a wait of  mins or less whenever we go this is a good thing considering the locations back in my hometown pembroke pines fl area always have a minimum wait of  mins no matter which day it is but moving on the food is pretty good paired with cabernet as long as it isnt too dry the best server there is leo he is so chill and just plain good at what he does hes never disappointed us yet except when he isnt the server where we get seated  over all we always have good experiences on each visit|i have only eaten twice at pappadeaux seafood kitchen once in denver co and the other in phoenix az both visits were excellent my second and most recent visit was at the phoenix location the restaurant was very busy even still our wait was under our quoted time by only a few minutes everyone from the bartender to the server were all friendly and accommodating the live music playing outside was an added benefit management was also outstanding we had a challenge with the timeliness of our meal and the manager was very helpful in resolving our problem the food was outstanding with nice portions too flavorful creative and well presented are just a few attributes describing the food please consider southern california for a future location|our first luminaria night at the desert botanical gardens installations of bruce monroes conceptual light and fiber optic art enhanced the evening what we didnt know is that you should really go for the music a night desert stroll candlelit by thousands of luminarias and different musical groups interspersed throughout with coffee and wine bars hot drinks are not hot enough with heaters and seating make a relaxed and enjoyable event plan to spend several hours wear walking shoes and bring gloves and a hat to go with your scarfit gets cold out on those trails  we got there at  and took in a sunset over the papago mountains and cactus spiring into the night sky  dinner at gertrudes was good but not as good as the beauty of the desert ill go again especially if theres garden art too|went on a cold and cloudy day in december rained a little as well  great place but dont recommend coming in the winter for the gardens they looked pretty wore out one thing the place was supper quiet wondered if some of the buildings were even open lots of stuff to do here on a warm spring day thats when we will be back|this is chicago style pizza and if you are from chicago you will like this pizza the red sauce is very thick and very salty the crust is almost bread like most of the people complaining on the site dont seem to know the difference between new york style and chicago style pizza if do you like chicago style pizza this is one of the few places in town to get it yes the service is not great but the product is good|outstanding except for the bread this the closet you will  find to genos or phils in philadelphia the person that conducted the challenge with phillys finest obviously should not be conducting food challenges i went to phillys first and feel like i wasted  dollars|came for the breakfast brunch  i think this spot is a great value for the money mimosas and bloody mary bar included for a bit of that hair of the dog full salad and fruit bar large dessert bar made to order crepes and omelettes bacon cut off the slab just to name a few items very good overall id come here again for breakfast|my husband and i love a good steakhouse we originally planned to dine at ironwood kitchen but the service was terrible waited almost  minutes with just water in our cupsno server in sight mind you too we made a reservation so instead we headed over to bourbon steakhouse which weve been wanting to try and asked if they could squeeze us in they had room at the bar which ended up being just as good as the floor dining we had a booth all to ourselves and loved the ambience and service especially they gave us a sampler of their potato fries and sauces for free being first time customers stars for that stars goes to bourbon steakhouse food for the followingmy husband is a filet epicurist and loves a good minimalist approach to a rare  cooked steak he was bummed to find out that they only offered an oz portion which he could easily eat two of and at the price of  it wasnt worth the size his sides were a baked potato and a shrimp cocktail only two prawns for the appetizer at  not nearly worth that price his potato was good  portioned but he had to dress and mash it to his liking which got a little messy he said his filet was good but not great he preferred eddie vs fileti ordered mushroom soup and a wedge salad blue cheese which i love was a little heavy on my salad though the pickled onions on it were terrific mushroom soup was good but have had other soup appetizers better other placesto average out food and service a good  stars is deserved would go again but it might be a whilewere glad to say weve tried it|had a great meal went with a small group for a birthday celebration and they took care of us the server and wait staff were attentive and pleasant because we told them we were celebrating a birthday the gave us amuse bouche it was very tasty three in our group chose the chefs choice which was a  course tasting menu two of us ordered from the menu both options were good but portion size for the set menu was noticeably smaller the filet mignon was amazing great flavor the squash ravioli was awesome very flavorful with excellent seasoning the pork chop was good excellent seasoning but we were expecting something better since this is a house specialty it was good not great salad was fresh with seasonable pomegranate seeds yum desserts were all excellent prices were what we expected so reasonable for this caliber of restaurant i would definitely recommend|contrary to most people i cycle to the waterfront more often than i drive here to visit  my favorite area of the waterfront is the littleknown park next to the pump house a small museum where i like to sit and watch trains cross the bridge over the mon  my second favorite area is the trail itself both for its own beauty and the feral cat colony that lives along itneedless to say what most people come to the waterfront for is the shopping entertainment and dining options  the waterfront is the largest retail power center closest to pittsburgh and has at least one big box store from every major category  target giant eagle bed bath and beyond petco lowes etc etc  in addition to this theres a gym a dave and busters and a loews movie theater that are major draws  i tend to get suckered into visiting when i go to see a current movie that isnt playing at the manor  ive been to dbs oncewhile its fun be sure to bring your credit card as it also gets pricey fast  for other stores i tend to go to east libertyshadyside since its a lot closer to where i live and i can satisfy most of my daily needs there  there isnt an enclosed mall hererobinson or ross park are similar places where you can find one of themas for dining options i generally pass on most of them given that theyre also mostly chains tgis uno rock bottom enp etc  if you must dine at the waterfront proper i recommend burgatory get the nowait app to get in line virtually since the wait can be long and they dont accept reservations  otherwise i recommend crossing the rr tracks on amity st and checking out some of the local dining options available in homestead eg dorothy  blue dust gran agaveas others have mentioned aside from its proximity to the east end and sheer size the waterfronts major advantage is its copious free parking availability  if you want to hit several big box stores in one trip and the lack of a mall doesnt bother you its worth checking out  and if youre like me and are more attracted by trails and parks than stores the waterfront is worth checking out for that reason as well   stars|good nyc pizza tons of cheese and meat with great flavor a little pricy but worth every penny|my cousin came up from florida like she has done for years to celebrate our birthdays together we decided to have our celebratory dinner at brand steakhousemy husband and i decided on the porter house for two he would eat the burned parts  he likes steaks burnti am the opposite and i will eat the red pieces my cousin was like how can you eat that much steak my response was easy lol i love red meat so i have no problem with it the steak even though it was cooked a little too much for my liking it still tasted good since my husband doesnt like seafood i settled for the shrimp cocktail for an appetizer the shrimps were big and plump im glad that they dont try anything fancy with the shrimp like other places  i expect shrimp cocktail to be a certain way and not have like guacamole in it like i have experienced in other places we also had a loaded baked potato for our side which was also good the only thing that was a little disappointing was there wasnt any birthday dessert served they knew it was our birthday but nothing was done i understand that some steak houses dont do this its just the first time for me but i was fine with it the service was great though|this place is the best chicago style gyros place in the west valley they have a great selection of tasty mediterranean food and a ton of greasy brown bag chitown favorites fresh off the fryer their stuff always tastes fresh and the folks on staff are welcoming|cactus garden with all the lights was amazing went on a thursday night just after dark no crowds and easy parking pretty mesmerizing wandering thru it all definitely something to go to again|located at the ethel m candy factory and chocolate museum this cacti garden is quite impressive at night when lit up with the thousands and thousands strands of lights its a free presentation open until  on the weekends santa is there in the gazebo waiting to hear present requests and the gift store is open its a cacti garden with a nice variety of different plants from saguaro cacti to barrel cacti to bottle brush strands in festive colors wrapped around each they have some blow up decorations and moving structures such as deer or angelsyou meander through the intertwining pathways that takes about  minutes its stroller friendly and is a good family outing for all ages we had to park down the street in one of the many business center parking lots but the whole event is free which is really great if you are looking for a less expensive alternative to other holiday lights presentations|i recently enjoyed a facial from here and i had great results my only advice is do not come in with any jewelry on during my facial the student removed my necklace and did not tell me where she had placed it when i got home i noticed it was missing when i called the center back to retrieve it it was gone it was a necklace that meant the world to me and i dont understand how it could of disappeared from the spot the student had placed it great results but be careful what you bring in|many years ago i went to grille  prior to a game and was so overwhelmed by the crowds that i never got my beer and had to walk out  it wasnt their fault i am just simply ridiculous in large crowdsi finally made it back here for an actual experience this november  i went with my sister and brotherinlaw and we decided to have a small lunch and beer here after a long day shopping and playing around in pgh  grille  has a decent craft beer menu including many local brews and i opted for a church works beer and decided to forego food although i did pick at my sisters edamame which were good but not salty enough  it was lunchtime during the week and the place wasnt very crowded and we easily got a seat at the bari would love to write more about this place but nothing really stands out for good or bad reasons  it was just another sports bar that happens to be owned by a legend and situated beside heinz field  that is definitely its appeal|this place is super creative and cutei loved all the little decorations in each room  we came here pretty early and barely beat the morning rushyayso i had the breakfast sandwich with sausage spinach and cheese on a croissant  it was super filling but i also had to grab their salted caramel brownie since the cashier said theyve sold millions of their famous brownies haha  it was definitely sweet and unique  lastly i had to drink up their mocha as well i believe it comes with two espresso shots so i just asked for one  i was already all amped up from sugar|loved the arizona roll but the spicy tuna roll left something to be desired my first time at the restaurant was a bit weird and the wait staff couldve been a little more helpful there was a dead jellyfish in the tank that looks like it couldve been dead a few days or more as it was turning brown and had slime or spitlike residue surrounding it the tank is not well kept and the fish seemes like they were starvingoverall it was a decent experience but i will not be returning any time soon|this place is great always reasonably quick service even when its busy i went today after we left pf changs after being ignored for  mins  got great fast service at bravo and i even got a free little birthday dessert for my birthday from the server i highly recommend the grilled salmon salad i get it most every time i go there and its always great|i really love this place and if i was wealthier id eat here regularly for now ill stick to enjoying the once or twice a year splurges during arizona restaurant week this place is unassuming from the outside you just dont expect a steakhouse of this caliber stuck next to a highway overpass deep in the blue collar suburbs this is scottsdale level food at scottsdale level prices but worth every penny the staff are always cordial to friendly and make sure to take newbies through the menu for each visit the steaks and a la carte sides are fantastic and i really like the salads there the little touches like the hot plates and buttered meat are what puts this place above your chain style steakhouses desserts are always on point the butter cake is worth a try but there are always more interesting options on the menu|i love trying new places and decided to go to anntonys after i found a groupon its located in elizabeth next to bang bang burgers i came for dinner with my husband they have a nice sized outdoor patio but the inside is very tiny there are only about  tables however we were greeted instantly as we walked in i was a little skeptical at first because it wasnt the nicest restaurant from the initial looks of it but the food made up for it i ordered the  chicken combo which came with two sides i got a side of the rice awesome and the mac n cheese dont judge me for ordering two carbs the chicken was so good it was huge and it literally fell off the bone the sauce was also really good it was a cross between jerk and sweet the server even told us a little secret on how they make the sauce   im not kidding when i tell you my meal was huge and get this it was only  my husband got the two meat combo  chicken and wings  i would recommend getting the curry chicken or caribbean chicken next time as the regular chicken and wings came with the same sauce but they were delicious im glad i tried anntonys and i think i will be back in the summer for lunch they had a jerk and caribbean wrap that sounded bomb im a fan|plus grand gym au canada  complet avec beaucoup de services connexes  oui il  a des monsieurs

subbed for the vegetarian offering the question in the end would i go back im not sure without being able to see the menu on the day before i reserve ahead of time is problematic nothing seemed special enough to make me want to go back|we go here for smoked meat often okay more takeaway than actually sitting in the restaurant great smoked meat sandwiches|tres bonne qualit la seul chose qui

half an hour or more to get in but to our surprise we were seated right away in a small anteroom with several small tables and two large ones a waiter brought us a pot of tea and forksknives for andrew tooi had dim sum with my family all the time growing up so i knew what i was doing but andrew was a little startled and put off by the nature of the service especially when two cartpushers got into a traffic jam near our table and shouted at each other its all part of the chaotic fastpaced dim sum experience though i got us rice sheet rolls with bbq pork shumai shrimpporkmushroom hakow shrimp pork potstickers and eggplant stuffed with shrimp everything was extremely yummy and we were full after only  minutes we didnt feel pressured to leave when we were done nor apparently did the folks at the table next to us who sat without food discussing tmi health problems for the entire time we were thereyou really dont need to speak chinese to eat herei dontthe servers call out the names of their dishes in english and you can hold up your fingers to say how many youd like or just point and nod no pressure to take anything you dont want tojust shake your head or avoid eye contact altogether at the end wave to one of the waiters and they add up your stamp card and ring you up at your table it was   tip for the two of usnot bad at all considering how much food and the variety of dumplings we gotit was definitely comparable to many dim sum restaurants ive been to in the san francisco area next time it might be nice to come with more people so we can try more dishes between us plus some of the stuff from the menu but wed also probably have to wait longer when we left there were probably  or  people waiting to be seatedyum yum yum now back to burlington to dream of dim sum until our next montreal visit|love the portuguese chicken fries could be a bit crispier on the edges good natas for dessert|trs bon poulet avec la petite sauce piquante cest succulent  beaucoup trop

positive aspects include obviously the soup but the food in general is excellent im a vegetarian and there is a huge selection of vegetarian fare at pm furthermore if you cant find what youre looking for on the menu theyll modify a meat selection to suit you i highly recommend their salt and pepper crispy tofu as well as their general tao tofu their noodle dishes are great as well i like the finer noodles and they are always crispy and flavourful the vegetables are fresh and the sauces thick and savoury im getting hungry thinking about it theyre open late which is awesome but and this is a bit of a downer they tend to give you the bums rush if youre there too close to closing time the only negative thing and it isnt a bad thing if youre in a rush is that if you order several different dishes they all come at once ie youll still be working on your soup and your two or three other dishes will be sitting on the table getting cold but this is a minor thing the food is good prices are good and service is quick its my goto chinese place in montreal|my go to place when i need come fruit and vegetables that are hard to get always a great selection and often much cheaper than the stands around which refuse to tell you the weight of what they are selling when i need rhubarb to make jam its much easier to buy from here than a package of unknown weight from a stand and often quite a bit cheaper very helpful staff will even check in back if something isnt on the shelf great selection of mushrooms good selection of hot peppers number  on my list for unusual fruitvegetables number  and  are in the jean talon market clean well marked comfortable helpful what more can you ask for|this is the place to find many but not all of the unusual products when you are looking for something usual this should be the first place you go to also they carry some of the jams from the preservation society an amazing selection of hot sauces so you can burn your mouth|good service not the place to get gf bulk since containers are close enough for cross contamination but one of the few places you can get valrhona chocolate for cooking in appropriate amounts for a recipe without having to buy the  kg bag of chocolate beans selection of teas are excellent stocks gf items nonbulk and a good selection of specialty items my second choice for when i cant find something unusual they also stock nespresso compatible capsules and some really spicy chips|a few coworkers and i opted to have brunch at galleria i havent been to galleria in years so i didnt know what to expect the last time i came was about  years ago with a very mediocre breakfast experience being the last thing i remembered ive driven past the place for years now and i always wondered if i should give it another chance and i finally didfirstly the place is very nice and modern seating is excellent and they have a big terrace its no dump the service we got was friendly and efficient when one coworker ordered something in this case a specific burger they were informed it would take longer and it did they estimated  minutes longer than the rest and it was when he served us he reminded her and made sure it wasnt a big deal this was appreciatedi went with their combo  and strawberry italian soda im always a fan of italian styled sodas but for some reason this particular brand fell flat to me it simply didnt taste like much the combo  plate consists of a full breakfast such as eggs potatoes banana chocolate crepe toast fruits and sausages theres some variety that can be chosen if someone i mentioned doesnt suit you the plate was very good with everything meeting and exceeding expectations it was a very nice breakfast accompanied with solid servicemy only gripes beyond the mediocre italian soda is that the price tag is higher than the average youll find elsewhere i think this can play a part since the breakfast competition in laval was boomed in the last  years with new players in the game if your price is higher than the others you better made sure the quality is thereanother issue for me is that parking here is nonexistent very small parking lot with nothing available nearby on the street youll find yourself parking up a block to come here an eat thats an issue|great service awesome fresh pizza would definitely recommend lots of seats inside|fresh burgers friendly courteous staff fast service animal style all day erryday no matter which location you go to you can count on innout for friendly staff and fresh ingredients neat burgers never sloppy fave fast food chain always my goto in azca  really wish it was out east|food is okay service is lacking somewhat overpriced for quality of food for a few more dollars can have much better quality of food and service|we had an unpleasant first visit with a not so good haircut upon leaving a negative review and expressing how unhappy we were the owner linda reached out and apologized the customer service inclined us to bring our dog back to get fixed  weeks later although it will still take an additional groom to perfect my dogs hair back to normal the owner did a fantastic job and we have already

make an immediate left at the entrance but they have a massive kidsya selection toothis library gets bonus points for having tons of community events and an onsite coffee shop if i only lived closer id probably spend entire weekends here clearing them out of ny best sellers and peppermint mochasnonhenderson residents note that the library system is different you will require a different membership and card to check out here make sure you can return your books on time to a henderson library or youll obviously get late fees|not my favorite bbq place it has the chain restaurant feel to it i really like the loaded fries appetizer weve got it the last few times the other food is hit or miss ive had really good rids there fall off the bone meaty how they should be for a place claiming to be a bbq joint and then some times they are dry and small and leave a lot to be desired  the sauces are solid i think i have tried them all a little something for every one wait staff has always been nice and friendly some times it goes awhile with out them checking on the table but that seems to be a trend down south or at least around the concord areadrinks are good too and comparable to drink prices of the other places around overall give it a shot its not the ma and pa rib shack that you want to go back to time and time again but if you are hungry they can take care of you|gave this place another try after my first very successful time downgraded to three based on dinosaur like service and one customer who was very offensive to me stereotyping me based on my look and skin color granted he looked like he was  and senile but still didnt give him the right to say what he said to me i left and sat outside on the patio didnt have a very good experience|excellent amazing quality and fast service with no detriment to the tastiness of food hot and fresh used to have amazing huge scallops but due to price of scallops they were discontinued i actually appreciate that instead of them choosing to have them be so expensive everyone would lose no disappointment here ever|once youve been to one chilis you have been to them all decent food decent price decent service the good thing is you always know what youll be getting and there is something for everyone on the menu this is just your runofthemill chilis cant complain|met with other yelpers for the uye christmas dinnergiving the place has lots of stars i was looking forward to it however i feel a little letdown  like hamish s id say the food was hit and missid did enjoy the duck parfait with the fig and calvados chutney and toasted brioche the ox cheeks were lovely  so melt in the mouth but the sauce for me wasnt hitting the spot  to finish off i had the flourless chocolate cake with salted caramel sauce which was lovely and light but full on chocolate flavour for three courses from a fixed menu is a pretty good deal  i opted for a sparkling water as i was driving and had a double espresso to finish off the mealthe service was spot on and friendly plus there werent long waits for the food either considering there were  of uskudos for a gluten free options too as we had a gf diner at our table  bread was substituted with oatcakes but do offer separate butter with themthe atmosphere is casual so like alexandria m says you could go all glam or wear jeans and just go casualgive it a shot just dont build your hopes up from all the star reviews  just enjoy yourself|dropped in for the uye yelp christmas partya fixed menu for  was a reasonable dealthe food was a bit hit and miss duck parfait was an ok pate with fig chutney beef cheek main was very good and the desert  a steamed pudding was woefully short on saucestill probably worth trying though|this quaint little place specializes in quick and inexpensive pies they have a large selection of meat pies and i tried the traditional pie which had minced meat with onions carrots and other veggies the pie crust was buttery flaky and delicious the filling was so so and a bit on the bland side i would definitely return to try other flavors also they were out of sweet pies when we went which was disappointing|okay all we have come back  this is a good sign my hubby is trying the texan omelet  boy is heartburn going to be his best friend for the  hours  he says it is good i went on the lighter side grits and bacon and toast  ohh soo good|this is my go to cinema whenever i want to watch a movie its not cause this place is cheap oh no this place is expensive than the other cinema but i just got use to coming here vue is pretty clean though im starting to notice their seats are getting a bit more stains so they need to start scrubbing or replace the covers there are many screens and they tend to show the newest movies the tix for an evening showing runs about  estimate and you get a discount if you have a student card they have a large area to buy snacks typical expensive prices and they sell the same stuff you can find in other places such as popcorn hot dog nachos candy chocolates ice cream alcohol and cola what i like about this place the most id say is the location you can watch an early showing of the newest movie then go out to the bars or dance at the clubs theres also a lot of places to have a late dinner or dessert after ive always read they have discounted prices on tuesday if you sign up to be a member of it but ive never receive a discount code after i gave them my email so not sure how well this program is being implemented i only give this place  stars cause of the location and its cleanliness though they are slipping in that department|came to prestonfield as part of a large party celebrating my mums birthday it was pretty much the perfect place for this kind of event we had a private dining room which makes it much more relaxed you dont have to worry too much about bothering people by the amount of noise you make or in our case by two children running around with lightsabresthe building itself is in some lovely grounds complete with highland cows which is quite unusual given that it seems to just appear out of nowhere at the end of a residential street im not sure even how to begin to describe the decor inside there were patterned sofas and antiques everywhere curtains everywhere ropes guiding up the staircase there was a huge crown on our table it should be garish but i think the house embraces this aesthetic so wholeheartedly it gets away with it and you end up being charmedi really enjoyed the food the starter was a cinnamonspiced onion veloute its christmas so i guess cinnamon and related spices are used liberally its was a bit weird but i enjoyed it well enough main course i had a pheasant with red cabbage and pear dessert was christmas puddingsponge im not always a huge fan of this type of food i wasnt blown away by a recent visit to their sister restaurant at the tower this however ticked the right boxes it was tasty it felt the right kind of hearty and didnt feel overly pretentious it is however on the expensive sideoverall prestonfield is the kind of place i can definitely see us coming again for big family occasions its a visually pretty spectacular and the food was of a high standard|beautiful restaurant but sit in the bar to listen to the wonderful trio and singer  they make a very big deal about the quality of the meat and how they prepare it however on multiple occasions i have found my steak to be overcooked this is unacceptable given the extremely high prices for me the keg is a better bet for steak|the trop has something going for them when it comes to slots  they deliver the goods voted the best slots in  as stated on the large sign above the players club  promotion area where you get your slot cards and what not the gaming area off white lighting is like no other at the strip that seems to give off a warm ambiance that makes losing  less tolerating haha you can plays for hours and feel okay but better yet the slots machine pays off if you stick with it especially early in the wee hours the only thing negative is theres not too many slots that i would prefer compare to even hooters but maybe it just seems that way due to the lightingif you want a better chance at winning try the trop it might sound like i work here with the hype but i dont  i just like winning|food was excellent service was a little subpar person taking orders seemed disinterested and not willing to help us|i really like this place and try to visit every time i come to town  this location is far better than the one closer to my primary home|we spent a really nice birthday weekend at the vdara  entering the property is a bit confusing  it is located in city center adjacent to the aria  there is no self parking only complementary valet the hotel does not have a casino which is also quite okay if you are looking for a relaxing time  centrally located on the strip many desirable attractions are close by  the suites have a kitchenette but you have to request pots and pans from housekeeping the entire property is smoke free which was a plus|great service great food great wine but it was a little chilly because all the tables are by the door cant wait to visit again|i keep hearing about how awesome studio b is from locals and have seen pretty high ratings for it floating around the web so decided to check the place out with a couple of my friendsi did come sometime before but that was just before closing and i didnt get a chance to check everything out just a heads up though right now its  per person for the holiday season i dont know if its the weekend seafood buffet offerings but i really felt as this time around the food was really subpar theres  general types of food seafood carving stations desserts italian and asianthey did have steamed cold and ginger cooked crab legs but they were all cold  lukewarm at best and left much to desire i cant fault them too much for that since it is a buffet but ive definitely had better crab legs  even at asia buffet it was nice for it all to be halved though made it so much easier to eat the oysters were grainy and tasteless definitely wasnt a fan and im a huge fan of oysters in general the prime rib was very good but only if you got it medium there were also ham ny steak sausage and ham for carving stations the ny steak was cooked to rare   i didnt get a chance to try the other stuff but they did have a huge assortment of offerings including  different soups the asian section had really good sashimi salad i dont know what they used to make it but i ate an entire plate of just the salad the mussels and tempura shrimp in the same area were very good as well i think what studio b really shines at is their pasta which was really rich and decadent i really liked the lobster mac and cheese but it got really heavy after a while in general though the food really wasnt as good as i had anticipated especially if its the same menu as the much raved about seafood buffet there were also a lot of options for desserts if youve got a sweet tooth the gelato isnt the best around but its decent  what makes studio b unique is the unlimited beer and wine cant speak for the other drinks but they definitely make a strong mimosa i had  or  of those suckers and couldnt believe how good it was the third star is pretty much just for the mimosa because im pretty much just a huge sucker for any kind of daytime drinking|this place is kinda a cool gem they have a piano and people that work there sing quite a bit to someone playing the piano and if you know a song you are more than welcome to sing too its usually pretty slow everytime ive been in which makes it less fun but if your drunk its a good time|came here when i visited charlotte this was the only restaurant ive been to when i visited the area they have the best pho noodle i had the place was almost packed when i came but they still managed to sit us at the best area of the restaurant for me which was in front of the kitchen their kitchen has an open window where you can see how they cook observing their movements in the kitchen i can assure you that food here is really clean and cooked well im a spicy food hog and they didnt disappoint my spice level i would recommend this to everyone who is visiting charlotte and would want a dose of thaiasian food|decided to try this place today and the service started out slow we had trouble getting our server we ordered the frozen hot chocolate and the chicken n waffles it was delicious i would recommend sharing since the portions are huge i would return next time i am in town|using this service and company for the first time was just ok i was referred to this company by a friend who was extremely pleased after using this compnay after reading reviews and from my friend telling me that well receive updated texts and picture messages i was optimistic about it but i didnt receive any updates except that my kids  and  fell asleep i was a little disappointed but my kids did show me their amazing crafty things they did with the sitter my daughter said she read a few books but when my daughter asked her to play she said ok but never played and was just on her phone but overall my kids were safe the hotel room wasnt a mess id use this company again and request not this is same sitter|the staff is always friendly and courteous  the selection of machines is great but i wish they would replace some duplicate machines with more hammer strength  it would be nice if they could also install a small area with pull up bars that have rings and a wall  with the popularity of crossfit and ocrs it would be nice to not pay money to go elsewhere just to participate in such exercises  ive had a few training sessions with chris standage and hes amazing|had a bad experience but the owner was terrific at handling it  will be back|i have to be completely honest here ive been to this restaurant several ok more than several times and ive only ever ordered one thing with that being said i can really only rate this place off of my addiction and love for their yellow curry shrimp strange i know but i would bathe in this dish if i could there is something about it that i just cant seem to want to try something new and i like trying new what else can i tell you about this place the service is good and i highly recommend the yellow curry shrimp oh and the thaitini because thai iced tea is ridiculously good and mixing it with vodka is like making it my birthday present|i loved this place  i definitely recommend downloading the nowait app to make sure that you dont have to wait for a table for two hours  we got a few plates  the dirty south nachos fried meatballs shells  cheese and the ki roll  my favorites were the ki roll and the shells  cheese which were phenominal  the dirty south nachos were good but different and the fried meatballs were good but a little dry  i got an amazing cucumber vodka mojito to drink which was a perfect pallet refresher  the interior is super cute and very intimate|ive been to both laurier and saint paul locations i much prefer the service by the guy at the saint paul boutique he always have a little info or fact about any garment ive been interested in buying super nice and approachable the selection in laurier is much bigger i feel like the old montreal is changing cahier dexercises ssense etc and the selection at this particular location is still very formal i would appreciate if there is a bit more designer items in this location but other than that great place|ive been eating here for years best veggie fried rice ever delivery usually takes about  minutes but always hot and correct order if youre going to sit down the atmosphere is great light and fun not too noisy staff is always nice but sometimes you do have to hunt a server down overall one of my favorite thai restaurants|love it here especially the french accents ive been going here for over a year about once every  weeks and have never had a bad experience went last night for my birthday dinner and for some reason they were slammed but food didnt take long and service was good the macaroons are excellent get some to go|i finally progressed to excavation the sewer line and placing the new line to the side of the house  dennis stated that the line was  feet below his mark  the line was exactly where he said it would be within  inches in depth  thanks dennis|good happy hour food pricing and service when you can get the bartenders attention id go back  beer good prime rib sliders a bit overcooked but aok with tobasco|the food was again delicious i had the chile relleno carmelitas and a small bowl of pazole both were very flavorful and fresh tasting unfortunately this time the service was somewhat below average which was hard to understand  considering that it was not busy at all for lunchdespite the weak service i will continue to go and work my way through the menu|absolutely wonderful service the staff especially art have us a great stay shuttle to and from airport was very timely too loved it|the liberty seems like one of those places that can be my safe place to go when i dont know where else to eat  the food was decent  i had a chicken sandwich that was so huge i couldnt even eat it because it was falling apart  flavors were good but the chicken sandwich was a complete mess  fries were good  the server was nice and helpful but wasnt around muchso has anyone ever heard of blue cheese ranch  now ranch is more than just a dressing to meits a condiment  i could put it in just about anything  the blue cheese ranch i had the other day was a little weird  i definitely wasnt a fan of the flavor combo  im sure there are people would could mix the flavors but this was the first time i ever asked for a side of ranch and couldnt eat itanother first for me was the fact that the restaurant was louder than the bar area  no problem getting a seat and it was quieter  they had some live music from a guy that was decentoverall i would say this place is ok  its almost like everything was good with the potential to be better but it just missed the mark  youre not going to come out saying omg that was the best meal ever  its a large space so if youre hungry and you dont know where else to go you can count on the liberty  ive heard good things about their brunch so ill have to check that out sometime to see if i have a different experience|service was quick  dinner special was tasty will definitely be returning soon|we used to go there all the time for the great food hadnt gone in a while so i decided to take my wife on a casino date found the menu had changed ordered egg rolls or spring rolls for an appetizer they no longer had either what chinese restaurant doesnt have egg rolls or spring rolls  dinner was just ok i ordered a dish with two indicators of spicy i guess salt is a spice as mine was way over salted and i like a lot of salt  i hope we just hit them on a bad day because we used to love this place and just for that will we try them one more time|this was another cheap place to have lunch and it was close to the hotel planet hollywood which we where staying at while in vegas they had a number interesting hot dogs we decided to get the vegas strip dog which was awesome and the and the ruben dog which was really good and a order of onion rings which you cant go wrong with this place was a nice little find and the service was fast seating was restricted to outside only which was ok they did have the heat warmers which made it better the only down fall was there was a lot of birds that where always around but they werent to bad it was a nice place to have a quick cheap lunch and just enjoy some people watching i really dont think you could find a bad dog on the menu as it was a pretty large menu i will definitely be back|very good quick service and accuratealthough we had  bacon cheeseburgers  large fry and two medium drinks they are not skimpy on the large fries  was plenty for our family of bacon was crisp and delicious too|i finally progressed to excavation the sewer line and placing the new line to the side of the house  dennis stated that the line was  feet below his mark  the line was exactly where he said it would be within  inches in depth  thanks dennis|ive tried about  dishes from here and most of them are pretty legit i like the ribs and the spicy bombas be warned theyve got serious kick the colorado lamb is the only dish that i can recall not liking  it was just kind of bland to me overall a fun tapas restaurant  be ready to spend person before drinks|this place has great prices and the food was very good too they have a very large menu and allow you to order lunch at breakfast time this is definitely a dive the food is served on styrofoam plates with plastic silverware but it was delicious  my only complaint is that for some reason they only allow one refill on fountain sodas i dont understand this because fountain soda costs restaurants next to nothing you are basically paying for the cup so why not allow more than one refill  we will definitely be back|very clean and nice laundry mat not weird at night the manager was really helpful to me when i came in and the laundry card machine was broken he started my laundry for me with his card and let me go get cash to pay for it nice guy and gave me a few tips on the large comforter i was washing good games in the back and enough to keep you and a kid entertained for the duration there are a lot of washers and dryers and the space isnt cramped so youre never in other peoples wayonly reason i gave  out of  was for the inconvenience of the card machine being broken and having no atm in the building also no wifi and no tvs|i am basing this review off take out experience i havent physically been to the location my boyfriend picked me up some lunch from here and i got the  piece chicken box with fries and pinto beans everything was really good and hot and fresh the beans were amazingly good the chicken could have been a little more moist and seasoned but with some hot sauce and a little salt and pepper it hit the spot definitely will be back and prices were very reasonable|pharmacy is worthless thank you for nothing not caring nor helping my  month old who needed the medicine also thanks you i am updating my review and adding two stars the last couple of times i have used the store has been pleasant i printed some photos and the gentleman who helped me was very kind and helpful|one of the things to love about wr is it is byob more later on this  another is the food is usually great however it is noisy  we were with friends that go to wr several times a year  we started with the one appetizer that was some cheese and charcuterie  really enjoyable the menu changes frequently except for two items  wr now has a winterdecember menu that is interesting   i had the lamb rack lollies that were spiced and grilled perfectly and roasted beet carpaccio and sumac creme came with the lamb  the meat was prepared perfectly and tasted great the beets and sumac creme were a nice compliment  i did manage to get a bite of the duroc pork chop that was very good  again a very well prepared meal  will wr is byob we were charged  for the byob i guess because we had two bottles at  per bottle  that is to much i understand you have to have glasses and clean the glasses but  is to much and not competitive  also our server opened the wine but did not offer to pour the wine or have much contact with us  service was acceptable but not exceptional  one thing that wr likes to do is make sure you get your meal and finish for the next seating which i understand but we felt rushed and were never told there was a time limit  actually our friends said they tend to rush so lets not hurry and feel we have to order our main course immediately yes i will go back but only with friends for a special occasion  it is expensive and the food is good but noisy noisy noisy|my husband and i are locals and have been to this location several times the food is decent and the service is decent i do like when they host events like fights or even new years eve they have s large patio which im sure is larger than the whole inside which is nice for those events and they have a great fire pit|this hot topic is better than a lot of other ones it just seems cleaner and more organized ever since star wars and avengers became huge this store seems to have a lot of cool stuff in addition to your usual doctor who anime and other random things and there seems to be a sale every week the clothes are pretty cool too if you are the type that doesnt shop at old navy or gap or any place for the ordinary folks this is a place for people with style or just a bunch of nerds|nice decor service was as good as it was asked for food came out very quickly after we ordered it which makes me wonder whether they have prepared contents that they assemble by order if so it explains the overcooked noodles in the padthai i didnt like the fact that they dont offer padthai with flat noodles but only with thin noodles took away from the whole padthai eating experience that comes with the flat noodles and the flavors it generates it was also extremely sweet marinated and had no particularly thai spice flavors the meat to noodle portion was pretty good though again did not get padthai as padthai should look and taste so far royal jasmine in litchfield is my favorite thai in west valley|ate here for the first time  decent burrito  cant complain  but nothing to write home about  overall if you want a quick bite  youre good to go|after a response from the doctor i have decided to amend my previous review i still feel there was a lack of compassion from dr reuss after what was a very long and both physically and emotionally draining labor however my son did arrive safely and without a csection it just saddened me that after reading outstanding reviews from other patients i felt i did not receive the same care and consideration|went to lynn for first time she did a wonderful job on my nails and salon has a very nice atmosphere will be going back again|not to many dollars tree stores in scottsdale i used to go to  nice ones when i lived in gilbertthis one is just ok  not a very good selection and they are always low on spring wateri used the rest room there on my last visit and it was so dirty it was gross  tp was on the floori checked my receipt when i got home and i got charged for  six packs of water instead of so they will give me a credit when i go back lolthey have good prices on cards|ive been ordering the mixed grill platter for a while now but recently tried their fried shrimp with curry sauce its my new fave my oldest daughter enjoys the musubi while my youngest loves the katsu chicken i will say that if youre in a hurry you should call ahead because they actually cook your food when you order it i dont mind the wait for fresh food the staff have always been friendly and polite my only complaint about this restaurant is that it sometimes smells like a sewer its reminiscent of a sulfur smell im not sure if they cook something that puts out that smell or if theres a ceptic tank issue in the building for this reason i usually order my food to go|my boyfriend wanted to spend his birthday weekend in las vegas so i wanted to surprise him with a birthday cake i began doing my research and came across this we live in los angeles so it was really hard picking a bakery from another state without tasting anything but i gave it a shot i worked with them through email and they were so helpful i told them my idea and they came through with a wonderful cake my boyfriend is a huge baseball fanatic so i wanted a baseball field we stayed at the rio and they were able to deliver it to us at the hotel for a small extra charge when it arrived and i saw the final product i was amazed he absolutely loved not only did it look amazing but it tasted great if i ever have something else to plan in las vegas i will definitely order a cake from herethank you so much for such an amazing cake|what a magnificent location in the crystals absolutely gorgeous  had the lobster roll as an appetizer and they were incredible  friend had duck legs they were dry and i  had the meatloaf and that was very nice  waiter was over seated and rushed|i love ihop and no matter what state i am traveling i can count that the menu is the same and so does my favorite items taste the samei love my country fried steakservice for me was fast and i didnt have any problems with anythingfood was fresh and the pancakes were nice and fluffygood job ihop so far my best place for a fast and affordable breakfast|i came here to buy some supplies for my trip home as i was staying in a nearby hotel this walmart supercenter is humongous and it has a wide variety of products to choose from here while many of the products at walmart often are cheap and not of the best quality i always know that i get what i paid for and  for what its worth walmarts themselves often serve nicely as one stop shops even though i do not visit them often that being said my experience at this location was good  yes it was crowded yes the shelves were messy and yes it was a stressful experience due to the crowds and the children running around i did however come here on a saturday afternoon so that is to be expected one thing i do wish however is that some of these walmarts had a playground or something to keep peoples kids from getting hurt like ikea doeshowever this is walmart and my expectations were to find what i needed and get out of there which i did although the place was crowded i was able to find help in acquiring what i needed and while the lines were long checking out they did have a self checkout which made things easier as far as the messy shelves are concerned i think that was mostly due to the popularity of this place as a shopping destination overall while i can never say that i will stop here if i wanted to do some serious shopping it works well as a one stop shop for what i need|if youre staying at the talking stick resort this is a very convenient way to have a relaxed meal and you should be able to find some foods you really like i noticed a selection of olives fresh mozarella and tomato and picked up a serving there was a carving station serving fresh pork and i also got some shrimp  for dessert there was a wide selection of gelatos with an assortment of toppings like shredded coconut oreo cookies and mms  naturally there were numerous other choices these were my picks the staff were friendly and attentive  overall it was a great value the pricing was really fair there is also a large bar if you want cocktails  one thing to think about is tipping  i tipped when i checked in at the front desk but probably should have waited to tip the server directly i ended up tipping a second time because the waitress gave good service and i did not want to leave her empty handed|this place was pretty amazing and you could definitely spend hours here  also in the winter you can ice skate right out frontsounds like a pretty good day plan to meanywaysi enjoyed seeing tons of different cars of course  its so interactive here tooyou can play games where you race someone to change tires and pump gas you can hang out in a car and enjoy the simulator watch some videos clips and justlearn about the history and read about the various stories pertaining to nascari loved seeing all of the different exhibits here  the gift shop is pretty sweet as well|came in for breakfast on a sunday they were real busy so we had to wait  mins for a table nbd once sat out order was taken promptly the waitress was friendly and the food came in a timely manner no problems|i was really pleased with their selection of fresh bread in the shop it was still warm this is s budget super market and i was able to get a full basket of shopping for not much money and a few items that i have never tried before but looked interesting i dont like it when they rush you through the till at top speed but i understand that this is how they keep their prices low and employ less staff do they have to be quick|the jabawockeez of abdc fame were a clear favorite on our list of shows to see in vegas this is a newer installment for a show in vegas but looks to be a permanent one at the luxor        my wife and i were wowed by the elaborate dance and light displays it is not pure dance performance the act does a good job of integrating the audience into the fray there were many moments to dance or clap along such as the harlem shake battle between the three sides of the audience and frequent volunteer opportunities i enjoyed the battle aspect of ninja crew vs roygbiv crew it was not short on comedy either with jaba members sporting goofy moves or putting audience members into roles where they would be the dancing shows true mastery of their craft but does not rise to the level the many of the jabawockeez routines on abcd went to it left me wondering if it was really the same crew behind the trademark masks since there were more than  members surely some of the members must be new        this is a premium price show and well worth it seeing the jabawockeez live was once in a lifetime|this place is truly one of a kind the guy who has worked here for a long time the owner is pretty introverted but a reply good guy i dont think he means to be rude hes just an awesome quiet guy the food is always on point and the soda is always cold the only thing that would make it better is a bigger spot for this place to really grow another thing that i wouldnt mind is bigger patties on the burgers the double patty is a must here|sunday pm met my  sisters for lunch we werent super hungry and just wanted something small we ordered the spinach artichoke rangoons which came with homemade ranch and the jewish sliders which came with brown gravy both were delicious i wish i were more hungry so i could order more my only complaint was that the challah bread was a little hard i will definitely be back|reserved seating and recliners mmmmm oh yeah they show movies here too the theaters are smallish which means that if youre sitting anywhere closer than halfway back your face is in the screen saw star wars here in d not imax unfortunately and the sound and effects were just about perfect a bit pricey but you get what you pay for|you can call in ahead of time to this large and clean poker room decent game selection for most appetites  max rake with no jackpot helps the long term cost plus they comp  for food its nearby the sportsbook yet they have lots of tvs on the wall with different games playing the food selection from grand luxe is extensive and very reasonably priced and theres also a noodle bar next to it years ago venetian pumped in this vile perfume smell that was overpowering but im happy to report thats gone they redid the pit area nearby so it feels fairly hip i havent stayed but apparently the venetian stock rooms are all mini suites for the very reasonable poker room ratei prefer playing  to  nl holdem they had no  but several  games to choose from for the most part it plays a little smaller than the  next door at the wynn probably due to a capped buyin of  instead of  if you like to play deeper with biggerbetting players its not a bad walk across the bridge to the wynn if you dont like bullies then youll probably like it better herethey also had a list for  big o  card plo i really enjoy that game and hear it goes often but not todayall and all a quality room worth checking|the ramen was good but not awesome we came for dinner but the line was supper long so we left we came back the next day for lunch waited about mins glad we didnt wait more than that this restaurant is so small with  people capacity which explains why there is always a wait service was friendly|fun pub with live music and a great selection beers on draft gets really packed on weekend nights so get there early if you want a seat|definitely one of the best mexican places ive been to in charlotte i have a lot of food allergies peanuts nuts and shellfish and this place took it very seriously the manager came over to make sure everything i ordered was something i could eat plus i dont often get to eat chips at mexican places because they fry the chips in the same thing as the shellfish but this place had a separate fryer for the chips i was in heaven and literally could not stop eating the chips i will definitely be visiting here a lot more once i officially move back to charlotte i also got the queso with the chips and it was really good however i feel like there wasnt as much queso as i would get at other places overall this was a great experience and the perfect lunch spot|we didnt realize they had moved to the bigger space next door and for one horrifying moment i stood staring at the locked door in front of the paperedup windows devastated after a moment andrew said well lets just go to this other place instead and i said okaylo and behold we picked up the menus and it said mai xiang yuan phew the quality and taste of the dumplings were just as good as our first visit though the tea was subpar now that weve been here twice we will probably explore beyond mxy for our next montreal dumpling experience|service has gotten better and it seems like management has changed hands  the authenticity of taiwanese breakfast here is unmatched  upgrading to  starts  but you have to like this sort of food|
