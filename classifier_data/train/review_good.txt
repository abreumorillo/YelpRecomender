we checked this place out this past monday for their wing night we have heard that their wings are great and decided it was finally time to check it out their wings are whole wings and crispy which is a nice change of pace i got their wet cajun sauce and garlic butter wings the cajun did not have a bold enough flavor for me and their sauce is too thin the sauce was also thin for the garlic butter but that is more expected they were better than average but i dont like seeing all the sauce resting at the bottom of the boat i would definitely come try this place out again to sample some of the other items on the menu but this will probably not become a regular stop for wings anytime soon|decent range somewhat close to the city  the mats are pretty solid however the grass range needs to be tended too  its like hitting out of us open type roughnot very amenable to practicing  which kind of defeats the purpose of going to a golf rangestill gets  stars because the range is lit up at night which is excellent for those of us who are addicted to this amazing game but are somewhat short on time having a job kinda sucks sometimes no|after waiting for almost  minutes to trade in an old phone part of the buy back program our customer service rep incorrectly processed the transaction this led to us waiting another  minutes for him to correct it dont visit this store if you want pleasant or good service|have been coming to this gym for many years now mainly because of the proximity to my house and lowish price prosengaging diverse range of classes that get switched up often i have seen tai chi cross fit kettle bell etc they make an effort to keep up with fitness trends and the teachers are often inspiring and sociable going to spin and aerobics classes at ef can feel like being part of a community if you want it tofunctional equipment various types of elliptical machines some things are old but some are new  consinconsistent with providing free sweat towels sometimes they are there sometimes they arent not the hugest deal in the worldno soap in the womens bathroom ever seriously disgusting at a gym to know that no one is washing their hands with soap no pool yet still costs as much as la fitness which has more facilities however i understand it is a family owned business so i support them regardless|good for cheap drinks and wings they offer daily specials which is nice doesnt look like much from outside but the inside is friendly enough the bartenders have been there for awhile and do a good job dont expect to have a huge selection of alcohol their wings are good as are their salads if you are gluten free this is not your placelots of fried food and sandwiches offers a quick lunch|good beer selection understaffed for a light monday night crowd it wasnt her fault she was the only server but it took about an hour to get our sandwiches mine was one of the best reubens ive ever had|we met a couple of friends there on a friday afternoon about  pm based on the yelp reviews ive relied on yelp in over a dozen different cities never came away with anything less than a positive experience until today we ordered within  minutes of sitting down there couldnt have been more than  people in the place counting the people on the patio  took them almost  minutes to serve  sandwiches and a salad i tried the fish sandwich came out fried extra crispy on the ends if there is such a thing as fish jerky a third of the sandwich would have qualified it was just ok ive had better at almost any church that fries fish during lent all  of my dinner companions left partial sandwiches  or salad uneaten bread french fries and onion rings were good though iced tea was good though ive never seen a place dispense sweet n low like they were giving away their last rock of crack asked for sugar but never saw any they dont carry any other artificial sweeteners besides the pink stuffi may give the place another try in the future for a reuben or hamburger assuming today was some aberration possibly due to a cook having a family emergency or something like that waitress was pretty good held up under my multiple requests to find out if they caught my fish yet hardly ever rolled her eyes |very disappointed in the customer service we ordered reubens  and wanted coleslaw instead of kraut they charged us  for the coleslaw we will not be back  the iced tea is also terrible tasting|the bar is nice enough the servers are attentive enough the food is good enough their is absolutely nothing wrong with this place but the problem is it is not a place that will stick out from the crowd its kind of lost in the crowd pittsburgh is a city full of bars this one is relaxed its a great neighborhood bar and i would come back but it is not a wow that is a great place  its just good enough|friendly local bar with great service and good food  wont be disappointed if you like bar food at a reasonable price  good place to go for friday fish sandwich |i will start by saying we have a nice new deck that is where the good part endswhy two stars if we have a nice deck now well it all started in may when we had a man named al come out and talk to us about the process he was a true salesman ill tell you that not a straight shooter but an excited salesman that wanted to sell and we bought into ithe told us they were backed up with the harsh winter and a lot of jobs but they could probably start by june th mind you this was the end of may we met with him he said they would have to do a survey of our land and get a permit from dormont before they started we felt confident in going with them and booked itheres where things fell apart weeks went by with no word from them on the process finally i called and left messages al finally got in touch with me and the conversation was utterly confusing he must have not understood me because he just kept talking in circles so i hung up not knowing what was going on finally i called back and the admin told me that the survey could take a couple weeks to come back i wish al would have told us thatso our june th date came and went we finally got our survey and they were quick to bill us for it but no word on where we were in the process i called back a couple times with no real answers from the admin apparently they were now waiting for the permit from dormonta month later i was frustrated and asked to speak with someone at the company i spoke with someone who told me that dormont usually takes a week to process the permit but we were now going on a month he told me he would bug the guy about it and we finally got it i completely understand that waiting on the permit is not their fault but why no communication about it just call me and tell me theyre waiting for the permit but theyll work towards asking dormont what the hold up is seems simplefinally we get the permit and work is supposed to start tuesday comes and they have to wait for approval from dormont on holes theyre digging so holes are dug and equipment is put in my backyard and then nothing happens for two days where did everyone go who knows because i wasnt informed i was upset and contacted the company owner dave by email i told him how frustrated i was about the lack of communication he wrote me two sentences that  said there will be acres there tomorrow morning to finish and most will be done tomorrow well that didnt happenthen two other dudes show up two days later and did work for about three hours and left the main guy comes back the next day and says they did it wrong so apparently the part about how they wouldnt need access to my house changes to theyre drilling bolts into my house to secure he deck finally the second week into construction my tiny x foot deck is done it was upsetting that they left the deck dirty and all the dirt and cement they moved around wasnt cleaned up i even asked them to fill all the holes they dug up and didnt use and they only filled up one when you create a construction project isnt it just good business to clean it up and make it look nice didnt happen heremy main point is contractors have a reputation for not being the most trustworthy why be that company why not be an upstanding company that consumers can trust my main issues with them were that things were not communicated to me properly up front nor was the ongoing process communicated to me then they left everything unfinished in my eyes leaving the site dirty i understand things happen and things get delayed but just email or call me its not that hard to keep me updated it is  with a million ways to be contactedeven though i have a nice deck after i clean things up myself i would not recommend them to anyone|im not by any means a gear head im lucky i know where to put the gas in my car i have triple a in case i get a flat because i have no idea where my jack is i took my present car back to the dealership the day after driving it off the lot to have them show me how to turn on my hazard signal also to show me how to release the parking brakes and how to turn on the rear defoggers yes the owners manual was in the glove box but there was way too much reading involved and i learn quicker by hands on trainingadvanced auto is a god send for me when i needed windshield wipers the ones on the car sounded like a cow being skinned alive each time i turned them on so i didnt use them often which isnt good in a driving rain storm i walked in and went up to an associate and asked him where the wipers were not only did he get me the wipers he saved me a ton of embarrassment by putting them on for me at no extra charge i gave him a nice tip which he refused but i insisted i also picked up a nice leather steering wheel cover proud to say i figured out how to put that on without a mechanic and a gas additive to clean out my fuel system this place has everything and if youre not a gear head theyll either show you how or do it for you great customer service|i actually stopped at the one at the crafton ingram shopping center but they are all basically the same i had been here earlier this year to get replacement wiper blades the man who helped me not only gave me his recommendation on what would be good for winter driving but also put them on my cartodays visit was to purchase some general car supplies as a holiday gift they carry basically everything you need for self service im not overly sure on their pricing but since it is convenient for me i visit itso far ive been pleased with my purchases|so back in the late s there used to be this superkickass cinnamon ice cream like an apple pie ice cream without the apples or the pie crust  so delicioushowever now there is some shittastic replacement that tastes like vanilla ice cream with last years redhot in the middle totally gross  fortunately our server was nice enough to warn me about the change and bring me a sample so i only had to suffer the death of a childhood memory rather than also having to pay for itthe portions are big and filling just dont come for the ice cream|i have never seen a restaurant that has a frowning brownie aka frownie as their icon mascot or spokesperson  kings family restaurant has surprised me with this  i think it might be in direct dialogue with eat n parks smiling cookie  funny funny odd not funny haha  we were seated rather quickly by the manager  very nice people work here i was happy to find that even though they had closed a section the server was willing to stay longer to serve us our dinnerwe chatted with the server a little bit  she was quite engaging  and then moved on to order our mealteapepsiopenfaced hot turkey sandwich with mashed potatoes and gravybuffalo chicken strips with mashed potatoes and macaroni n cheeseour drinks arrived and our server conversed with us some more about the area  she would leave every couple of minutes to check on our food and to make certain that her other tables had everything they needed  eventually our entrees arrived  both piping hot  i went straight for the macaroni and cheese  it didnt taste bad but i swear that it is made by stouffers  i didnt feel the need to eat that much knowing that there were other things to eat  i tried the mashed potatoes and found that they too came from a package but again they didnt taste bad with the brown gravy  i moved on to the main part of my meal  the buffalo chicken strips  at least they were all white meat and the buffalo sauce was more than just mild  i contented myself with eating them  i tried some of the hot turkey sandwich and just left the rest for my friend since it was not fresh cut turkey but instead luncheon meat that had been heated  i finished off my dinner and was happy in the end  no it wasnt the best food in the world but the service greatly helped the perception and it didnt taste bad|hoofah|breakfast timei stopped by the kings family restaurant prior to grocery shopping    i have never been to a kings family restaurant since moving to pittsburgh   there are several local establishmentsthis particular location has pretty good food at a great price   it is similar to a cracker barrel and  or bob evans   i ordered something very hearty  country fried steak  eggs and cheesy potatoesthe food and coffee were good    the service was excellent i will go back  breakfast runs from    my breakfast cost me just over   very comparable to cracker barrel  bob evans|average run of the mill store  associates are young teens and they really dont know where anything is  luckily i am able to get around to find everything  found my puppy treats and moved on|not bad for a shop n save most are privately owned so availability of items might differ from place to place the only time i frequent s n s is when the have their huge two day sales usually held on thursday and friday at least once monthgood bakery at this location too|unfortunately i only have one complaint about this dry cleaners it was well kept and clean inside the man waiting on me im guessing the owner was very nice both dropping off and picking up even though i lost my ticket turn around time was ok for a cleaners that dont do cleaning on premises whats my problem then price my daughters dress was  to clean i think thats close to what i paid for it my ladies shirts were unit maybe im not calibrated on pgh prices but this seems outrageous my search continues for a neighborhood cleaners btw they do mens tailoring there onsite and it looks like it might be a big part of their business i would try them again for that after i check costs|real talk i took my car through the carwash here once got a nasty gouge down the side and the guy at the counter didnt seem to care the car wash has since been decommissioned which is totally ok because the getgo carwash across the street is excellent and better in every way|typical bp usually pretty crowded in the evening due to location on washington but never had to wait to long staff is pretty nice and always pleasant cant comment on the coffee or anything else because i only ever get gas|two meals on the recommendation of a friend who lives near the place and after the second trip i was compelled to write rocky would definitely describe the experienceson the first trip i went to try their at that timeraved about reuben and yet to find a true good reuben in da burgh i tried itwell they were out of the proper bread and the guy had to run to the store to buy the closest thing he could find which was not the proper bread and instead of one of their raved about reubens i received two minireubens which basically took the guts from one reuben and spread it out onto two sandwiches on regular sized bread i ate it it wasnt great but they swore it was because theyd run out of the bread bread or not it still wasnt great the atmosphere was pleasant in that blue collar bar kind of way and the staff was very nice but not a winning pitch on the reubenthe second trip was after a long day of moving furniture with the same friend sat in the back room instead of the bar which felt more like a restaurant of course with the big screen tv covering the sports of the momenti was in the mood for dinner this time and after a scan decided on fried chicken and mashed potatoes with the salad bar my friend ordered one of her faves the breaded pork chopswe hit the salad bar which was uberbasic three soups mostly vegetable loaded which left me out basic iceberg lettuce mix very probably out of a bag a few veggie toppings and three or four dressings it was a basic salad no big deal more or less an appetizer filler before the mealthe mindblower in this trip was the ordering of the fried chicken dinner our waiter looked like a  year old gas station attendant skinny little blonde guy with a sweet but incredibly naive face and an air of vapidity which was confirmed when i placed my order i asked what chicken pieces came in the dinner and asked if it was possible to only get dark meat i never imagined how confusing a question that could possibly be it literally took him two trips back to the kitchen to ask and the child honestly had no clue what white meat and dark meat meant the first answer he came back with was that the chicken came in a preportioned prepared bag kind of kentucky fried chicken stylewhich didnt answer my question thus prompting the second trip after the second trip back i heard the cook holler tell him ill fix him up well the chicken was prepackaged dreck like youd find in the freezer case of walmart tiny and not good and the potatoes had that slight tinge of chemspuds flavor laden with some kind of chopped up green parsley and a side of that basic brown gravy served up in  gallon bucketsthank goodness for the basic salad bareven my friend admitted that her pork chops were different and not what shed expected they also appeared to be from a freezer bagthe irony was that the boy who didnt know white meat from dark meat was chatting with some other customersabout baseballand he was a genius about the mindless sport of baseball ahhhh da burghthird base nahwhy bother when there are so many other options around go on in a grab a beer and chat black and gold if you happen to be in carnegiethey can help you out all types of ways in that area just dont go hungry if you actually have tastebudsfrom what i understand it used to be really good homecooked food but apparently mama has left the kitchen|i have been to this place a million times over the years have been there during the years it was less than clean to the present where it is almost clean this place is a neighborhood standard that for some reason compels you to return even if your experience was less than stellar fancy it is not gourmet it is definitely not every item on the menu seems to come from a can bag bucket or box the wait staff is often clueless and changes like the wind i have never had the same server twice but the fact is you get a decent meal for a decent price and always have a little to take home yes the salad bar is very basic not every item is a fresh as it should be the iced tea often takes on the taste of lord knows what however  the fried fish dinner is one of the best i have had anywhere in picksburg their meatloaf is terrific as are several of their hoagies in a nutshell this place has a lot of flaws like we all do a few upgrades like a better wait staff fresh gravy instead of their gallon bucket brand homemade sauce instead of whatever canned stuff they are using would jump this review to  stars rockys is worth going to you will definitely find something you like and you will definitely go back decent food decent price good portions and an overall pleasant experience|if you want a true understanding of pittsburgh in the morning come here this greasy spoon is always packed and is one of the better of its kind south of the citythey serve waffles in halves which is great the eggs and toast are good the homemade hot sausage is excellent the drawback are the barely cooked potatoesif youre hungry get the mixed grill gab and eats brand of the kitchen sink breakfast that all midwest places are about|ok what is with all of these cash only places in pittsburgh i can appreciate that some smaller businesses might have trouble installing a credit card system in their storeresturant but could you perhaps provide an atm  in the past this would deter me from eating at this place looking at a standard breakfast menu i decided to go with a tuna melt instead what i got was a cold tuna salad sandwich with a slice of cheese on toast i had ordered a melt being in the mood for a warm meal but to no avail one day later i cant even remember what my side was i suppose it didnt leave much of an impression on me  i have to say that the dessert was really good the cherry pecan pie i have not seen this concoction anywhere else but this was awesome the cherries were not the sweet canned variety but a pie worthy tart topped with sugar i think i want to make this pie with my parents next harvest of our cherry treemy first impression is eh  i am learning how crazy pittsburghers are over breakfast seriously waiting  minutes for a table at a tiny diner with a menu that reads as follows   eggs and toast xxx eggs meat and toast xxx eggs and pancake xxxid rather go to a dennys and order the create your own grand slam|really just ok it was chaotic and no one alerted us to whether we should seat ourselves or wait to be seated and when we tried to ask a woman working behind the counter she gave us a dirty look like we werent welcome there eventually we just sat down and someone came by to take our order the server was nice enough but wasnt very quick with the coffee refills  i finished my first cup slowly and then it sat empty for about five minutes food was ok but not amazing we got the mixed grill and a pancake and both were solid but not outstanding not a bad place to go but we probably wont go out of our way to go here again either|this place is divey but cute the food is obviously not fivestar but its a great place if you want to get a good hearty breakfast we went there for lunch and got burgersoddly enough the server said that they dont sell french fries on sundays so we had to settle for home fries i thought it was a little weird at first but damn those home fries were good i didnt even care after that the coffee is great tooits a unique little place its basically one long strip of a kitchen then booths set up right beside it they also have a pretty cool breakfast bar where you can sit and watch them grill all of the food to order the coffee cups didnt match  they were all christmas mugs lol  they have a wall in the back where you can sign your name with a dry erase marker and they have little trivia boards on the wall just for fun its definitely a place of its own kind the prices are very reasonable and i would definitely go back again|we came here once before and remember it not being very good but figured wed give it another shot since its pretty close to our home its still just ok we didnt have to wait this time saturday morning at  but there was a wait throughout the time we were there the menu is very basic no specialty pancakes waffles or french toast and only  specialty omelette there were no meal options so if you want home fries or something its extra the omelettes do include toast great bread btw we had to wait a while for our food which was surprising because weve been to a lot of diners my husband and i both got omelettes and agreed that the contents were not really cooked with the egg its almost like the egg was completely cooked and someone threw the cooked contents in there and just folded it over as for my mushroom and cheese omelette the cheese was lacking my biggest peev about this place is that its cash only perhaps i missed it but im pretty sure this wasnt noted anywhere on the menu or the front door thankfully we had enough to cover our bill buts not a good way to end the meal when youre scrambling and digging for change there are a lot of good diners in the area so i doubt well be going back|my first time going to barbs country junction and i really wanted to like this place i really didhowever i didntthe food was decent some was above average and some below but it was overall decent i got pancakes bacon and eggs the pancakes were really good and fluffy the home fries were simply okay and the eggs were not cooked well my son had a burger and it was good the coffee at this place was brewed to perfection which a appreciate i would give the food the service was subpar for sure while our waitress was a really nice girl she wasnt on top of anything at all had to ask for coffee refills had to ask for silverware for napkinsetc she got the order messed up and so on i give the service the inside of the place had some country charm as youd expect but want particularly cleanly it also had a leaky roof in several places which had buckets collecting the water a customer even tripped over the buckets and fell i give the interior the prices were decent i fed my whole family breakfast  of us for  i give the prices so in summary you can get okay food here for a rather cheap price but it is not a great place to dine in by any means there are better diners in the area that i will patronize in the future rather than barbs|my husband and i tried this place for the first time today it was easy to find and no problems with parking its seat yourself but there were no signs stating this so we stood there looking like fools for a minute it took awhile for the waitress to acknowledge us and im guessing that this was barb she apologized and said that one of her workers called off today no big deal and her apology was appreciated she came back with our drinks dropped them off and left again we didnt see her for another  minutes ultimately we were there for  minutes before she took our order this was aggravating to me i dont mind waiting for my food if i know its going to be awesome and theyre making it with love but come on now we ordered the hot pepper omelettehome fries toast and chocolate chip pancakessausage the food was alright really nothing special a new waitress ended up taking care of us and she was much more attentive we may or may not go back|for the price i ended up paying this place was fine there was a full kitchen king bed and tv i was just surprised at the lack of amenities at the hotel while i have stayed at other extended stay hotels i was surprised to find a sign in the room at this one stating that you only got your room cleaned once per weekif you wanted it more often than that you would have to pay for it if you needed fresh towels youd have to go to the main desk to get them they also only provided a small bar of soap in the roomnot the typical soap shampoo lotion etc this didnt bother me too much as i was only staying a couple days but again i found it surprising not to have these basic things the hotel in general was easy to get to and very easy to get back onto to freeway from the hotel was clean and the people who worked there were very nice|front desk gets  startshowever if youre looking for a good night of sleep you may not get it  the refrigerator made a lot of noise at night every time the compress kicked on  likewise with the air conditioner  if you didnt bring a hair dryer youll have to get it at the front desk  theres a sofa bed but no extra pillows nor blankets|it looks so much better in here since they changed from paddys to rileys its a shame however that they had to keep that same curmudgeon of a bartender that ruins the experience can somebody notify me once they get rid of him|okay so hopefully you havent been enjoying happy hour  rileys pour house before you read this or you might not be able to follow the lilting irish owners to recap murphys pour house from  sullivans pour house from  paddys pour house from  and bagpipe please rileys pour house opens march  of  still with meits a tiny long bar just like the old irish pubs no more smoking allowed hurrah  same lousy service my guess is that the entire place needs no strike that  demands an automated foodbeverage ticketing system none of the cooks bartenders or waitresses know who ordered what nor what ticket belongs to which table its actually pretty funny if youre not a hungry or b thirsty i really really want this place to do better we need more irish pubs and local old time watering holes get it together murphys  er i mean sullivanser i mean paddys or is it rileys     whatever the case they have cold guinness and irish music  and fun patrons|  visit   i am from san francisco bay area and if u want a dive go to china town in san francisco  this place was dirty like chinatown dive but some of the best food i have every tasted came from a dive the food was really good and my group ordered a bunch of different things it was all good a taste prices are reasonable a they dont speak english very good and got my order wrongsweet potatoe fries apizza   aeggplant hoagie bgreek salad bgyro aif they scrubbed the place down and the lady spoke better english  star |are you are really looking at the review for ljs  its fried stuff with extra fried stuff in a cardboard boat  you will regret eating it  minutes after you finish but it is delicious|i agree with paul on this one but i had to stop here on my way home from work tonight i think i feel my heart yelling at me again  the gal at the drive thru window was just soooo sweet  i just might go back and ask her to marry me but then again  she gave me a slip with a survey on it to fill out online maybe she just wanted my positive response ok sarah b you got it  now wheres my free coke |i love ljs but i  had to write a review regarding this particular location  the inside is very dated and appears to be poorly cared for  it smelled like burnt fish when we walked in the door  it took about  mins for the food so i figured it was gonna be all freshnegative  the fish was old and cold and fries were a very soft  the corn lacked butteri didnt care for the onion rings and my boyfriend said the coleslaw tasted spoiledthe chicken planks and hushpuppies were the only things edible  service wasnt too bad  nice people  too bad a whole bunch of flies started flying around the dining area and prep area which ruined my appetite|don don is a restaurant i find myself missing now and again its probably my favorite restaurant in carnegie simple setup just a small restaurant with a few tables and a tv oddly enough i think my favorite thing to eat there is the wonton soup never had better the food is average but i always enjoyed eating there great service and a cheap place to get chinese food|far away from real chinese food doesnt even taste good as american style chinese food|i used to order takeout here once every month or so the food tastes average and the price is good its your typical lowend chinese place the last and final time i ordered here i just so happened to be picking up my order while a health inspector from allegheny county health department was making his rounds while i was waiting on my food which took much longer than usual the inspector was pointing out violations he also requested a copy of a certificate that the man behind the register was unable to produce the inspector looked at me like i was crazy for waiting on my food despite the obvious poor conditions  as for the rest of the place  its always been kind of dirty inside the carpets are just filthy and the walls match there are always childrens toys scattered about the floor because the owners children are always there so be careful not to trip the workers do seem like nice people just trying to make a living but when it comes to cleanliness don don is lacking|i came here with two friends prior to visiting apis meadery next door this past weekend  i ordered the general tsos chicken and my friends ordered the sesame chicken crab rangoon and another appetizer egg rolls  they ordered the combo with less meat and i ordered the one with morethe names were very similar which i found confusing the food took quite a while to come up  min so id suggest calling ahead if youre in a rush  while we were waiting the woman behind the counter yelled at someone over the phone in chinese and then at a guy who came in to pick up food for delivery probably the same personto be honest im not much of a fan of americanized chinese cuisine i lived in singapore for  mos and have visited hong king and japan its been awhile since ive had it and this dish reminded me why  i dont care for the overbearing sweetness and thickness of the sauce nor do i care for the precut meat in the dishes i like to cut up my own meat thank you very much so the flavors and textures dont do much for me  having said that my friends claimed this was the best americanized chinese fare theyd had in pgh and they live in squirrel hill so if youre a fan of this cuisine you can take that into considerationif nothing else this meal provided us with some muchneeded food to absorb the alcohol from the mead which i appreciated|dude its dennys its excellent drunk food packed on sunday mornings not very good but not really bad either its dennys when you walk into a dennys you know exactly what youre getting into why the heck are you even reading reviews about a dennys thats like looking for reviews on an ice cream truck youre getting the same thing no matter which one you choose|i bought a three month membership last year mainly to attend the silver sneakers classes i was in my early sixties and hadnt exercised in a while i tried the evening classes but they were very crowded and difficult so i tried a morning class for seniors i like to stretch out before my class actually starts so i went to the tail end of a yoga class the women in this class were very nasty to me and told me that i wasnt welcome to stretch out in their class i never went back thanks to the attitude of the other members i didnt feel welcome here i complained to the manager who said that i was welcome to stretch out in whatever class i wanted to but the hostility of these yoga students was very evident do they think that this is their private gym|ive been to papa js twice and had mixed experiencesboth times i had the banana pepper appetizer which is great and goes really well with the fresh and delicious bread and cheese they give you at the start of your mealfor entrees me and my girlfriend have had mixed experience  ive had the fish sandwich very good and the eggplant parm sandwich okay  my girlfriend got the salad with bread and basil on it but the basil was over powering and the bread was soggy with the dressing the service is also a mixed bag  the first time our server went out of her way to take care of us and even made me cocktail sauce for my fish sandwich  the second time the server was lackluster didnt know anything about the menu and wasnt able to take proper care of us  i would return to papa js but i my terrible experience last time isnt enough to say it would be my first pick of places to eat around carnegierobinson|i have to say that i write this review with much regret because i have always loved papa js but my recent experience there has changed my mind a bit from the minute we were seated we were greeted by a server that was clearly inexperienced and didnt know the menu as i said before ive been to papa js a good handful of times so i know the menu decently well but the server couldnt explain any of the questions i had about a couple new dishes i was thinking about trying i swear this guy must have just looked at the menu for the first time a few minutes agobut it wasnt just the knowledge of the menu it was one thing after another with our server my wife asked for a glass of water  times until she finally got it at which point the meal was over so we didnt care at that point  i mean come on for a restaurant of this calibre and price is it too much to ask for a glass of water there was no one filling up watermy biggest complaint however is what happened with our meals my dad and i both ordered the trout special trout with roasted red peppers and lump crabmeat instead the meal that was delivered to both of us was trout with a heaping pile of spinach and mushrooms not what the special was at all  and by the way that item is on the menu as a regular item so whether or not the mistake was made by the server which we are sure it was or the chef who knows for certain not to mention though that a good server wouldnt have served us that regardless but before you think we had an unusal experience that was all due to a poor server let me continue when we informed our server of the mistake he didnt really believe us until he checked his order sheet and then he blamed the error on the chef at this point the meal had been sitting because it took us forever to flag this guy down again so the trout was basically cold the server then said he would have the meals remade so he took the meals back to the kitchen meanwhile of course my wife and mom are eating their meals and my dad and i are sitting there with no meals also keep in mind that my wife still had not gotten the water she had been asking for and my iced tea had been refilled with a soda yes believe that or not all the kitchen did was scrape their mistake off of our fish they didnt remake anything our fish was served to us again with little pieces of spinach and mushrooms sticking all over it quite frankly the fish wasnt good at all i honestly would have rather had a fish sandwich from mcdonalds that night the server never did anything to try to make our experience better  he knew we werent happy but never offered anything such as dessert on the house im not looking for a handout but our experience was just plain awful that night the guy never really even apologized for the mistake normally i may have asked for a manager but at this point i was ready to just get out of there plus we had to be somewhere else that nightmy opinion for the money there are many other restaurants i would rather eat at|coming here you get the feeling they havent changed much  the tables the decorations the menu  all the same  does that make you a little worried  yesi ordered the mushroom ravioli and it was oily  very very oily  the actual ravioli was okay enough mushrooms  but it was oily  did i mention that  ambiance like i said left much to be desired  i dont think id have this place on my list of musts for downtown  much better restaurants to visit|had dinner at papa js with a group of   i loved how the restaurant is in a old brick building with large windows it felt like a neighborhood restaurant on a saturday night the restaurant was full but not crowded  we were seated in a room with poor acoustics  it was difficult to hear people at our table and the waitress  while she tried i can see the asperation in her face when she had to repeat the specials to both sides of the tablepeople ordered bourbon on the rocks before dinner which seemed watered down while my lemon drop was made nice  the bread was delicious  can you describe it to be creamy  the fried zucchini was lightly breaded and not too oily  it was a large portion made up of  sliced zucchiniswe ordered a variety of dishes  the pasta dish was dry with more pasta than sauce or meat  those who ordered the fish special thought it was delicious  the shrimp dish was enjoyed as well  i had the chicken marsala which was pretty good  the marsala sauce wasnt too thick and the chicken moisthard to tell if the deserts were homemade  the tiramisu and spumoni were small in portion and meant for one on the whole i was on the fence with my overall impression of papa js  aok probably is the best way to describe it|service in this place is poor because of lack of acknowledgment since people working there are just working  they have nice decornice bar and good bread consider where this place is the prices are really really high  nothing is served on the side with main dishes |papa js is expensive and inconsistent  the ambiance is nice but it doesnt justify the prices  there are better restaurants in carnegie|although the first impression through the door is charming and the aroma enticing  as you enter this restaurant much can be improved upon for the prices asked for the dining experience our group of  had called a week ahead and were seated in the back of the far dining room right by a door where clinking pots pans and  dishes were heard throughout our meal as well as a darth vader type noise coming from the ceiling vent our waitress was not knowledgable of all menu items and three of our  very simple requests did not come out as ordered  dressing on the side of a salad  less feta on an entree and no oil on another entree the waitress blamed it on the cook but did offer to get one entree changed also we were asked if we wanted pine nuts feta or gorgonzola on our salad and then were charged  extra per item in addition to the salad price  which brought the salad up to   outrageous there is so much possibility for ambiance in this restaurant  but they miss the mark on service and atmosphere i will most likely not return very overpriced for the quality and service|service was great apps delish specifically the stuffed banana peppers  lentil with ham soup i think i chose the wrong entree though because i ordered a cod with crabmeat special the cod was completely tasteless with some crabmeat layed across the top it all reminded me of boiled fish yuck note to self order the pasta|man has this place gone down hill  my husband and i went a couple of weeks ago  we had salads and pasta  both were on the verge of inedible  with a single glass of wine i felt downright robbed at the  price tag  seriously i could have easily made what we had with jarred sauce and boxed pasta at home classico is better  and the service was pretty absent to make it even worse seemed she knew it was terrible and didnt want to deal with it  seriously id rather eat at the og|once upon a time papa js was a great place to eat great food and knowledgeable wait staffunfortunately after a couple of very unsatisfactory meals we will not be going back looking for a great italian meal look elsewhere|our pizza was cold and our drinks where empty  we are not going back  the waitress started as attentive but slowly slipped away to the point where things became frustrating|talk about overpriced  for a fairly basic pasta with some obviously frozen chicken chopped up over it the latter was terrible thin and flabby and rather unappealing the pasta itself was ok as was the sauce the desserts are pretty good but honestly that is a  dish whose price has been inflated|i struggle to write this review simply because this dining experience confused me first the restaurant itself is on a convenient corner st in downtown carnegies main street when you walk in you the first thing you see is a counter filled with desserts and amazing looking house made breads it rather looks like a deli counter you have to walk around to get to the hostess station and then can go left to the bar or right to the dining area a bit confusing layout but tastefully done the dining area is brighter than the rest of the restaurant it felt much more upscale once in the dining area but i did find the overall restaurant tastefully unique the food  a wide range of italian dishes and seafood we ordered the crab hozel as an appetizer it was an average serving of lump crab meat i had to ask for cocktail sauce it was tasty but cost us  we then ordered the veal and shrimp entree with sauteed veggies like artichokes eggplant peppers etc there were  smaller sized cutlets of veal and  shrimp  there was no salad or pasta side offered the dish was prepared properly and was ok we just felt it needed something else now the bread that was offered to our table came in a small basket and was filled with a variety of their house made breads the pepperoni bread was amazing i mean really delish this alone i would have given  stars the service  our server waswellim not sure what he was quite frankly annoyingconfused hyper  he appeared to have no idea what he was doing half the time bouncing around the table asking the same questions over and over forgetful spastic etc at one point one of my colleagues said is he on crack we chuckled but seriously he forgot to even ask us if we wanted dessert which was too bad because we saw some amazing looking offerings in the cases as we were leavingoverall  if i were in the area again i would definitely stop in to get some pepperoni bread to go as they do sell it by the loaves however i think i would try somewhere else to dine|ok a few things first we walked in and asked for a table and was told it would be  mins so after  mins we were seated and there was  tables that were open why the hell was there a wait the older man that took us to the table could have done nicer the bread was great and that was about it the food was not bad but it was not good|i wrote a letter to the papa js but did not receive a reply therefore i will share my experience onlinetonight a friend and i dined at your location we were seated in the bar area by the sidewalk which is what we requested because of the great weather and the happy hour specials our server took our order of a gingerale fried zucchini appetizer side salad wedding soup  eggplant rolotini and chicken piccata  correct spellingwe thoroughly enjoyed the bread  wedding soupthe side salad was rather bland and unexciting lacking flavor  texture the spring salad consisted of leaf lettuce a single slice of tomato and one black olive i would have expected some additions such as onions peppers cheese cucumbers croutons carrots and the like   we enjoyed the fresh air while waiting for our appetizer but were growing concerned that it would arrive too close to the meal so we asked the server  bartender  about the appetizer and he told us that he had forgot to put it in he offered to put it in at this point but advised us that our meals would be out soon we decided to just wait for our meals and forgo the appetizer which were looking forward to    the main dishes were acceptable not outstanding the eggplant was very tasty and well prepared  the chicken piccata was flavorful but not as expectedthe chicken seemed to have been steamed or baked it had no signs of being coated and sauted  to a rich golden brown the chicken was just pale whitethe sauce was a simple lemon flavor it lacked any depth that would have resulted from the browning of the chicken i tasted no garlic or shallots the sauce lacked that famous tang usually supplied by capers which were absent  no pasta was served with the chicken the side of vegetables were well cooked buy again lacked any real flavor the would have benefited from a roasting which would have produced a rich savory taste produced by extraction of the natural sugars  once our meals were finished  our plates were taken and we waited another  minutes for the check the server seemed more concerned with what was on television rather than his customers the total was  and changei would have expected the salad and soup would have been removed from the bill for the error of not putting in our appetizer order but no such offer was made and i saw no manager come around and check on the customers as is customaryi am hesitant to go back to this restaurant or  recommend it to anyone after tonights dining experience  i hope this feedback will be beneficial to your business|i stopped by here a couple of fridays ago with my wife and  other couples  another couple in our party had made reservations before hand and when we arrived a couple of minutes after that time we were immediately taken to our table  whenever you first walk into papa js you immediately head past both their dessert case and bread making area  that is pure genius on their part as both their desserts and bread look good  then to get to our table we also walked past a bar and up a flight of stairs  after that i didnt really see much else of the restaurantafter our whole party had arrived and our waitress had taken all of our drink orders she came back up to our table and promised us that she would be back shortly as she had some desserts to take to a table  after about  minutes or so she finally did make it back to our table  for my dinner entree i decided on having the romano chicken  it came out a short time later with a side of broccoli  the chicken had a nice golden color to its breading and tasted pretty good although a bit salty  i can take at least some credit for that though as i may have used the parmesan that was on the table quite liberally  meanwhile the broccoli was over cooked for my tastes and seemed mushy whenever i bit into itthe bottom line for me is that i might stop by here again in the future  i wouldnt be the person to recommend it but i also wouldnt turn it down  i feel like the prices were fair for what you got and only wish that the service was a little better|this is a tiny starbucks and it locations like this although cute makes you wonder if your really meant to hang out or just grab your coffee and leave leaving is always a good idea at this location anyway since you have a nice fountain in the back with benches and it is a central part of the waterfront shopping starbuck isnt my favorite coffee chain by any means is it just me or do all starbuck coffees taste a little burnt and bitter no matter how trendy cool and upscale their establishments are i cant get around the yicky tasting bitterness of staryucks regular coffees talk about over roasting a beanmaybe something has changed with their regular coffee but i have not drank it in about a year i am not one for soy caramel latte foofy stuff still ill give the establishment tres estrellas for the fact that their espresso is acceptable and doesnt taste half as bad as the regular coffee bean|mmmpeppermint mochain my quest to visit every starbucks in the usa i have stopped at yet another location  this one is located in the center of a circle road  very cache and in a newer part of the area|this is a typical starbucks the coffee is good but the store is suprisingly dirty|i have to agree with joe on this one  the baristas are extremely friendly and the service is great but the fact that there are no comfy chairs or couches is very unwelcoming  i do think however that the building is beautifully ans strategically located in the center of the shopping  i just wish they had better seating|i just realized they remodeled this one recentlyish well in my world recently because its been a while since ive been heretheyve added more seating which makes it way more conducive to having a meeting here which is my concern during the week i imagine during the weekend it just fills up with tweens getting their sugar rush before hitting the movie theater the coffee or tea for me is still same old same old i dont imagine one single starbucks will break the mold and make original drinks|this starbucks is teenytinyseating inside is very limited  this is a starbucks to grab and go and continue your shopping at the waterfrontbaristas are friendly and fast|as far as starbucks go this is a pretty nice one  the baristas are friendly and while i was here a lot of regulars must have come in because they bantered away with almost everyone  the bathroom was clean and well maintained and the trash wasnt overflowing in the canisters around the store  the pastries looked fresh but i didnt partake  the noise level was also at a nice working level  not too loud music just barely audiblei do wish there was more seating  it is nice that this location has a counter at the end of the bar for sole workers but it doesnt replace more tables  im sure this isnt as much of a problem in the summer when theres the space outsidethere was a treat receipt promo going on but the barista didnt tell me about it which i found odd  usually when they have promos like that going on they ask everyone if they want their receipt to come back later in the day to claim whatever the offer is  today it was one of their new pastries for  i know in the summer they do  grande iced drinks with that mornings receiptoverall nice working or socializing environment  very friendly and inviting  its what ive come to expect from starbucks so points for consistency|im not a huge fan of this location i think that it was oddly built the small alleylike front makes it difficult to get past people on your way tofrom the bathroom or tables when its busy and theres hardly any tables to sit at furthermore people tend to clog the front on their way in which makes things particularly difficult especially in the winter weather the staff were pretty impersonal to be but maybe that was due to the high traffic of the place and the time i was there and the coffee that i had was cold im sure it was probably the bottom of the batch id probably only walk in here again if someone else suggested it before or after a movie or while we were shopping in the area|this particular starbucks was especially pushy with offering extra espresso shots when placing my order this has never happened before and it took me off guard  the barista came off dishonest and unfriendly with the up sell push  i will avoid this one at the waterfront for awhile| rounding up only because of the other places on our stop were so bad first stop on the munhall beer crawl  it was just a local dive with local beers no microbrews or imports|starbucks is a chain coffee and tea shop you will find most everywhere they offer free wifi they sell their coffees in bags if you like they also serve sandwiches and pastries some of the starbucks ive seen offer drive through services prices are reasonablei stopped in here since ive been hunting all over for a gingerbread man cookie they told me they are getting one in and ugly sweater design but they dont have it yet i plan to keep checking since it appears that no place i have been to has my holiday favorite so ill certainly be back to one of their locations|if there was ever a get your coffee and go starbucks this is it right in the center of the waterfront this starbucks has no sofa comfy chairs only table seating i love the baristas here but i dont like the location of the building|for someone who straddles the line between sometimes crafter this store can seem vast and confusing  theres rows and rows of baskets and bedazzling jewels and paper andoh myscrap booking  when i want to find boring old feltits likewhere do i start  im in a hurry as always and i rush in and the first thing i look for is an employee  no one to be found  i could call out and my voice would come echoing back  i run between rows of paper wood and gosh darn scrap bookingno felt  where do i find felt  where do i find an employeefinally i find one after  minutes of wondering around  shes incredibly nice and leads me to the felt  this is not the first time ive been hard up to find help  i tell her she was hard to find and she tells me that theyre low on payroll and cant have any one the floor but her  in that whole store just her  thats ridicnot a month ago i was again in a slight hurry and stood in line for about  minutes to check out with  employees at the register and  people per line i gave up and walked out  hey michael do you pick up what im putting down  youre not making any money because your costumer service sucksin fact theres no service to be found|its your typical chain craft store  and let me reiterate that im not a crafts person i walked in because i needed dial rods for some signs i had now for being a chain store i was a bit upset because even though they had a decent selection the amounts they had for each one i wanted were scarce  imagine me standing there with different sizes of wood in my hand and just staring in disbelief  and for a piece of wood the price was a bit steepi will provably come back here but only for an item that i cannot find elsewhere or if im too lazy to drive further out|i have been frequently shopping at this michaels store over the last couple months since i began taking a cake decorating class and hosted a large baby shower at my home the store has typically had the supplies that i need from cake and cupcake baking and icing to scrap booking supplies this location is pretty average compared to other michaels  its exactly what you would expect when going to this store its not a large store but its not a small store  just averagei do enjoy using the michaels coupons when shopping i definitely save a lot of money instead of toting around the paper versions i actually have the iphone app that has coupons available to use from the app my only complaint is that sometimes it takes a while to check out at this location i dont normally have a problem  usually only one or two people ahead of me  but sometimes it can be much slower today for example there were only two customers ahead of me but one of them was having issues with a coupon the line began to get longer and longer and though a couple associates were lingering up front they kept calling for someone else from personal experience of being a manger in a retail store do not linger or let your associates linger near the cashiers without jumping on register whatever the reason may be that you are not helping customers it still appears rude and make everyone more impatient|the one good thing i can say about michaels is that they have a wide variety of hobbies and crafts included in their selection theyve got items for woodwork painting knitting kids crafts scrapbooks you name it the problem is the variety of products for your particular craft is probably dismal theyve got lots of cool items all over the store that youre convinced that somehow you need because it is soooo cute and you could totally do something with it right the store feels cluttered because there is so much stuff everywhere however if youre looking for something specific good luck its not even a matter of the product being difficult to find in the store its that when you find the right section theres either nothing in stock or they simply dont even carry what you need i stopped in for crochet supplies and the yarn selection was laughable compared to many other craft stores i ended up going elsewhere for my stuff anyway plus the prices at michaels are significantly more than other area craft stores i usually only stop there if im already at tend waterfront id recommend checking other craft stores first unless you need glitter especially fine glitter michaels has the best glitter selectionquality of any store ive ever been to|i dropped by this yankee candle store on saturday to purchase the annual christmas present candles for my motherinlaw between christmas present purchasing and people wanting their house to smell like balsam and cedar cinnamon sticks or caramel pecan pie the little store was packed however i was greeted immediately when i entered and was easily able to find the same salesperson again when i had a question since i was only purchasing votive candles i was initially pleased to see an entire section for the store devoted to them but quickly became frustrated i couldnt smell some of the votives through their thick outside plastic since the votive candles werent all displayed with their scents i had to walk from the votive display to the fragrance display to better smell the scents and then walk back outside of that layout frustration i had a pleasant experience in the store|typical starbucks coffee chain  things i dont like about this starbucks  ive been there twice and both times the place has been dirty compared to the other starbucks i have been in if you have to use the bathroom they give you a key thats attached to this nasty bottle im pretty sure they dont clean that bottle after every use or even nightlyaside from that good coffee and fastfriendly service|its clean open  with hot shoe string fries and creative milkshakes what else do you want in life|well as steak n shake locations go this isnt the best one aroundbut it is burgers and fries that are open the milkshakes are goodpros always made fresh when you orderconsgreasy but its burgerstakes longer than typical in drive thru but thats bc theyre made freshservice on a scale of   being awesome is a |in general i do like shake n steak but this location is a hit or miss location  you never know what kind of quality or service youre going to find here  a friend and myself went a few weeks back after a movie and it had to be one of the worst trips there ever  you cant entirely blame the waitress since she was the only one there for the entire placepoor scheduling on the managers part however while she cant be accountable for the slooooow service she was accountable for both orders being incorrect  the burgers were over cooked and the fries were soggie and the milkshake was runny at bestby far my worst visit to steak n shake|rather typical sns  had a good lunch crowd  milkshake was good but not as good as enp down the street  it took to long to get the burger for some reason  minutes i realized cooked to order but this is a little long for sns  ordered the guacamole steakburger and it only had a small portion of gaucnot your usual amountkitchen was not up to speed on portion sizing for some reason  definitely did not look like the picture on the website  oh well|ah steak n shake you hit the spot after a night of drinking open  hours drive thru or dine in with wonderful cheap greasy burgers chicken fingers breakfast sandwiches and shoestring fries youre faster and cheaper than eat n park plus your employees wear those adorable bow ties granted if we were at a fancy party i might act like i dont know you but deep down inside you know i heart you|this place is s l o wlike so slow i have got up and left after waiting  minutes and not even being acknowledged by a server the food is okay def not worth the wait milkshakes are just okay as well booooooo|i really like the chili burgers are fair and salads are pretty bad pretty hard to mess up a side salad as others have said you never know what kind of service you will get store is usually understaffed and cleanliness is fair the staff is usually disinterested with customers and sometimes outright rude all in all what you pay is what you get cheap and crap service|fast food done right what more can you wanta throwback to old timey diners steak and shake is where you get a decent meal at a good price my sisters and i arrived on a tuesday afternoon around pm catching their  happy hour which we read on the door upon entry a lovely surprise this meant that all shakes and drinks were  off i ordered the western bbq burger which was  thin patties cheese bacon bbq sauce and fried onions it came with shoe string fries my favorite all for the low price of  are you kidding me whats not to like the food was actually pretty good i liked it a lot since it was happy hour i also splurged on a chocolate covered strawberry shake it was meh could have gone without it the overpowering taste of artificial strawberry really turned me off but the hot fudge saved it but how can you really go wrong with hot fudgeall in all  meals and  shakes came to  a steal also the food is good i enjoyed it id come back|the food is good unfortunately the service is very hit or miss the main issue seems to be with the kitchen the waiters and waitresses are often very apologetic for the long waits and its pretty obvious that some of them avoid the tables after taking the initial order to avoid hearing complaints|this place teeters between a  and a  star review  ive had pretty good experiences inside its usually the drivethru where things fall a part  its the rare place i can get a frisco melt well the only place i can get a frisco melt  and that steak burger alone is worth the risk walk in or drive thrujust take a gun on weekends youll be fine|steak n shakes food is pretty good and the prices arent bad for the quantity of food i ordered a grilled chicken salad with no dressing the salad looked thrown together and was  for  croutons tomatoes carrots cabbage lettuce and chicken breast they forgot the cheese the staff wasnt very friendly or helpful and seemed like they didnt want to be there there usually is a long wait at steak n shake but if you catch them when they arent busy you will breeze through drivethru that is i do like their food and you can eat healthy options but the staff isnt helpful and the quality isnt always there|i like to eat here because the food has always been good and kids eat free on the weekends which is great but this location is always woefully understaffed with five or six tables sitting unbussed while people wait to be seated whether youre inside or at the drive through the wait is incredibly long fortunately the staff are always friendly despite the ridiculous staffing levels the management maintains here|its okay food is cheap but portions are small for example i order the chicken tenders and i got  little tiny tenders and a decent amount of fries also the restaurant is not really clean either  this restaurant is not my number  choice|i am not a fan of this chains food or this locations servicehowever  steak n shake milkshakes totally rock  very thick regular is the perfect size to get me home from the waterfront|drive through service is better than going inside if you want takeout food is always served hot inside it just takes a lot longer than it should both to get waited on at the counter and for the food to come also the lids on the milkshake cups are awful and fall off easily make sure to hold on tight|slow service food is very cheap though the milkshakes are huge thick and yummy sometimes when i go here they completely ignore you when your the only person in line the burgers were good and the menu is pretty small food takes about an hour to come when no ones even there i would go here if the service was faster and better|another store which has gone the way of the dodo bird actually there was nothing basement like about it what will be done with the empty space that is the question| for a red bull and vodka im sorry i thought i was in pittsburgh not new york city sing sing a dueling piano bar is fun but it would be a hell of a lot more fun if i could have more than one watered down drink before i warbled my way through paradise city with the rest of the crowd|really enjoyed this a lot more than i thought i would  the drinks were on the pricey side but i didnt head here to get smashed|in my opinion sing sing is really not worth it it gets expensive because you drink maybe start to sing a few lyrics drink some more think of a song you wanna hear put  and title of said song on a piece of paper you drink they play it everyone else is trying to get their songs played so you put  on your next sticky noteand so on and so forth i wasnt really into it when i first got there but as the night went on and lager went in i started to warm up to the place i feel that if i have to drink in order to have a good time its not worth it but again thats just methe  stars are for the piano players who are entertaining and very talented and the rock bottom brews they serve|dueling piano bars in pittsburgh started at station square and they died out then when the chain restaurant magnet waterfront opened in  the parent company of the rock bottom breweries decided to open sing sing in back of the brewerywhen it first opened it was pretty cool the very first house band could put on a show that led to standing ovations i know i was there from stairway to heaven to free bird stayin alive to shes my cherry pie elton john to the boss they were amazing at sounding like the bands they were covering equally incredible were the obscure songs that audience members would shout out songs only you though you knew and they would effortlessly sing a good portion of the song sounding like the band whos song they sungbut today sing sing seems like its stuck in the early part of the st century the whole dueling piano shout out a song to stump the band sing us a song youre the piano man has run its course i dont hate sing sing but i could never come here more than once a year its a been there done that kind of place|came here with a group of girls and didnt have a reservation we paid the cover walked in and it was absolutely packed there was nowhere to even stand one of our friends was having issues with an expired license and when we found out that not all of us got in they let us get our  cover back without issue i recently went with a big group who had reserved about  seats people who were not in the group kept coming in to the reserved area but the staff was very helpful in dealing with the group they brew their own beer so do not expect to see any known brands there are only about  beers on top so if you are more of a light beer drinker you might not be too happy with the beer choices they also have mixed drinks and wine the mixed drinks around about  and they have a limited number of bottled wines despite what it says on the menu the entertainment was great and i would recommend it for a group outing but definitely make sure that you have a reservation|this place has gone significantly down hill  ive gone to sing sing about once a year for the last  or  years  when we started going there you couldnt get a seat unless you got there early  it was always packed  however each year the crowd seems to get smaller and smaller  crowd is an important component of a piano bar due to the interactive nature of it all  i was there last saturday night  and there was about  people there  very slow and boring  it appears the crowd is no longer allowed up on stage taking a lot of the interactive fun out of what this place used to be  this was likely my last time at sing sing  save your  and skip this place  a real shame because this place was once a lot of fun|the musicians at this place work hard to entertain the crowd so i cant say they are all bad  however the minimum for a song request is   i spent  on a song for my girlfriend and they never played it  they were playing songs for  and  but my  got me no where  even if they didnt know the song which i doubt they could have picked one they knew and improvised  my tip save your  on the requestsotherwise its fun for special events every once in awhile|i went here with a bachelorette party we had reservations which was good because it was packed that saturday night the performers were very talented but the acoustics were strangely off   the theme that ran through the whole show was to quote some phrases they kept repeating you bitch you slut you whore and  twinkle twinkle little slut why dont you take it up the butt which one of the pianists wrote on the mirror at the back of the stage you get the idea  perhaps if i had not been the designated driver alcohol would have made these jokes funny the fifth sixth seventh time or maybe not|pretty fun place to go every once in a while but believe me by the end of the night youll be ready to go the show lasts around  hours by the  hour mark youll be sick of sitting there in the crowd with your  a pop drinks listening to the same dirty jokes over and over and over again|talented piano players but i found it annoying they kept pushing for tips all night long we got the message server was nice and songs were good it was super loud in there so be prepared super crowded saturday night so make sure you come early|my best friend took me to sing sing for my bachelor party i had a blast the musicians dueling pianists made fun of me in a bunch of songs they also were really good at playing requested tunes rock when the show was over we shuffled across the hall to the connected rock bottom restaurant for some grub we all had so much fun that we went back for my buddys bachelor partythere were some drawbacks though we went on a thursday night so the atmosphere was lacking as the place was pretty empty and of course they are a little pushy soliciting tips when the place is empty but its not our fault the place is empty on thirsty thursday if their drinks werent so damn expensive maybe more people would show up and sometimes they used vulgar language which was just unnecessary since they would have otherwise still been hilarious also there was no table service and the only bartender was a bitch ill probably be back but only for a special occasion when i can afford it|typical but new  you see all of the people that are walking in and out and i must say the customers look like they work for a living hear  i swear one of the guys was covered head to toe in soot  that is amazing  ran around the store looking for those few items that i needed to satisfy my need to build and create  minimal help from the small quantities of employees but some of them actually asked if i needed help  after i had found the item|your typical area big box hardware store  its convenient to go to because of the proximity to other stores and how close it is to so many communitiescant really say much else about this place other than with the self checkout lanes its a breeze to run in and then out without having to deal with a single associate|this local lowes serves its purpose for my husband and me  a convenient home improvement store that we run into every month or two i am most impressed by the lawn and garden section of the store i am not sure how it compares to other lowes stores but when shopping at the home depot in north fayette last fall their flower selection was dismal compared to this lowes| rounding down its been a while since jb and i ate here and i would consider going back but we just havent gotten around to it the beer selection looked great but the first  beers that i wanted hadnt come in yet they were in the middle of expanding their offerings this really bothers meif you dont have the product dont put it on the menuits not necessarily vegetarian friendly i got a pizza and it was good not fantastic only good justin was satisfied with his meal its a good place to eat if you live in the neighborhood but i wouldnt recommend going out of your way|stopped by on a mon evening after trying to dine at smoke taqueria which is closed mondays parking on street in front or behind off hay st super friendly bartender in warmer months they have huge outdoor area  big screen  upstairs cornhole game area okay draft beer selection and big bottle selection tried the italian club which was really good  two of us split one also tried sweet potato fries  amazingly good home made chips w bleu were overpowered by sauce bathroom was in need of plaster and wall repairs  was grossed out by toilet brushholder on a shelf near toilet at eye level bet its a fun place in warmer months|this place is overrated a friend and i were looking forward to a beer and some good bar food instead the wings were terrible and the beer was good but overpriced theres nothing wrong with this place i just dont understand the clout around it there should be no clout|im reading on here that the food is really hit or miss ive only gone to dukes one time but the food was good it wasnt too busy so our service was very attentive and it didnt take long to get our food at allthe place is separated between a bar area and a more family style dining area we sat in the dining area because the bar area was pretty full the dining room area definitely fills up with an older have lived in pittsburgh all their lives crowd while the younger crowd is in the bar area ill definitely be back since i live in the area|ive been to dukes three times now when i first came to pgh a lot of locals were telling me that this was a good place to catch a game drink some brews and get great food most of that is true but the bad has mostly outweighed the goodthey have an excellent new tap system last time i went they had thirsty dog leghumpper on draft and it was perfect the system really elevates already awesome beer plus the selection is awesome it is a sportsthemed bar so you can expect drunk locals loud tvs and plenty of yelling im sort of into that so it doesnt bother me although i do think their staff is not well equipped enough to work among the chaos service is often slow and they give the waitresses zero training in the beers that they offer this is not a good place for trying something new as they cant tell you a thing about it the biggest downfall of dukes though is the food ive had three different but equally simple dishes there a burger a cheesesteak and chicken tenders the first was flavorless and cold the second was passable but nothing special and the last were absolutely awful honestly the batter and size of the chicken made me so ill i had to call it an early night i ate two of the  tenders seven and had to quit their fries are very good and so are the wingsid say dukes is a good place to drink but thats about it|came back tonight after a hiatus and missing out on getting food from the franktuary truck at voodoo homestead i was going to get a burger until i saw on the back of the menu that they do prime rib on saturday evenings for  you got a large cut of meat which was pretty tasty a large side salad and i chose a loaded baked potato for the side they were a little chintzy with the sides the prime rib came with no horseradish sauce or au jus i asked for a horseradish sauce which they had but the container was so small i had to ask for another it was a similar situation with the large side salad it was pretty big and required at least a second side of dressing the food was all pretty good with the prime rib taking the lead and the baked potato bringing up the rear as always the beer selection was pretty solid and i really enjoyed my east end brewery monkey boy|the chili dogs rock  the portions are huge so come hungry  big selection of appetizers that go beyond the standard bar food list  great selection of draft beer  noise level is good for lunch but may be loud for dinner|i went to dukes upper deck cafe recently and overall really enjoyed my visit  i went there to watch an elite  game and felt a little out of place as i was the only person in the bar that didnt seem to know everyone who was there  however that quickly went away because the regulars and bar staff were extremely friendly and made the entire game more enjoyable i was cheering for my almamatter from outta state and they all encouraged me to enjoy the game and not worry about bothering them if i was loud  the drinks were very fairly priced and feature a full bar and some great craft beer options the food was just ok  i ordered the wings which were very good in a unique way  the sauce is a mix of ranch and buffalo sauce and the wings come submerged in it initially this threw me for a loop but after trying them i can see why people love them messy but delicious i also ordered the pita pizza i would not recommend this as it just wasnt very good  i am looking forward to returning to dukes this summer when i can sit outside and enjoy some craft beer and those delicious wings|had corned beef sandwich meh onion rings were horrible extremely breaded and doughy greasy as all get out i hope the chef will take the hint when all of the breading comes back as i had to peel it away to get to the onion|db is nice once in a while but the food is insanely unhealthy they are also really clever about designing the psychological context in ways to extract money from their customers you feel a bit milked afterwards also much fatteryou pay for games using credits from magstripe cards this lets db give their games arbitrary prices and makes it harder for you to really know how much you are spending menus for drinks and food have no prices  for a banana split cocktail  for a michelob  i have no idea whether that is expensive but not showing the prices is clever because they can price their things and not have to obey pricing psychology like anchors and so forthwaitstaff hassle you repeatedly to order desserts oh and the dining room has plastic demos dessert trays to get that thought going in your mind as you walk to your tablethe games are all violent shooters or racing games dont appear to have changed much since  when i last went to db in california hope they can find more innovative arcade games in the futurenot a pleasant experience but at least its different from going to an ordinary restaurant|this was actually the first time ive ever been to a dave and busterswalking into such a huge space especially coming from the often narrow venues in san francisco was strangeunnerving actually because dave and busters is all about excess almost obscenely soas far as food  their stuff is standard most of it is fried and as another reviewer pointed out  not very healthy at all actually you have to really scour the menu to find some somewhat decent viable and nutritious optionsbut most people dont come to dave  busters for food they come for the gamesand while ive never been that into video games or arcade games  my brother and sister always have  i was apprehensive about having a good time here   but after awhile  my siblings enthusiasm about the place became contagious and i found myself really enjoying myselfespecially once i realized that i have mad skills at skee ball and proceeded to dominatetrust|dave and busters is an enigma is it dining a bar or  playground for video game lovers let me get the bar part out of the way first its overpriced and they try to get you to buy a glass to jack up your bill next the food just like all the chain places at the waterfront there are sandwiches burgers yes they have a blue cheese burger who doesnt pasta salads chicken fingers yadda yadda the games i swear over three quarters of the games have been there since  when the place opened i guess in ten years no new games have hit the sceneoverall dave and busters is unique to the waterfront but its time to update the menu update the games and get into the second decade of the st century|because i have significantly younger sisters i go to dave and busters about twice a year its fun for them and nostalgic for me it can get expensive and the prizes are cheap but it make for great sister days as for the food weve eaten there once and never again its just blah frozen and fried the veggie burger was put on there as an afterthought just so they could say they offer it a frozen boca patty thrown on a bun thanks i could have ran to costco for that drinks are rather expensive but thats to be expected so go for the games fun and laughter and maybe stop somewhere else for drinks and a bite to eat skip the bountiful chains that span the waterfront and try blue dust on amity street|a table for  please   that is what i had to ask for and knew that db could accomodatei happen to be in the homestead area for work   i really wanted to dig into my yelp bag of tricks provided by local yelpers and introduce my team to the shock and awe they deserved but  the shear numbers would made it hardwhen i started thinking about how we would have a manageable lunch  the only idea i could come up with was the golden corral  i knew that was not going to work for mewe decided to do something local and walking distance  db was itit is what you expect  quiet for lunch video games and a bar nearby but i had to forgo any festivities  it was a work lunch   i was pleased they had a under  calorie menu   i am trying to maintain a normal diet due to my stretchy pants being out of style and not wanting to look like a character out of family guythe waitress was very friendly and organized    i ordered the cabo style chicken  chicken breast lightly seasoned and chargrilled topped with pineapple pico de gallo and served with spicy rice and steamed fresh vegetablesit was eh   the chicken was cooked but the pineapple pico de gallo was bland  the rice was bland  the vegetables were cold   i really blame it on the fact i was with  compatriots for lunch so i am giving it a fair rating  everything was ediblemy team went with deep fried foods and burgers   they seemed pleasedservice  very goodfood  okay not great   my meal was ambiance  well it was clean but there were not really any people in dbthere are so many other choices for lunch that are local and close  i would definitely recommend another in squirrel hill  i suggest you use yelp to find you a better one then come back and play  |not much of a review for this one but just a few tidbits of infopool on fridaysaturday is  per hourim pretty sure its  through the weekmixed drinks are way too pricey for the locationthe food is crapthe games are fun and the pool tables are nice theyre the big tournament stylesize not the shitty barroom tiny pool tablesthat is all  the pricing is based on my recent tripwe shot pool for a few hours i had a bar tab that wasnt out of control and my night ended up costing me |think chuck e cheese for adults  skee ball video games pool tables  clean environment  good fununfortunately i went for a bite to eat and it was impossible to find anything good and healthy on the menu  i ended up settling for spinach dip  sadly they topped the dip off with horrible orange shredded cheese that appeared to have been popped in the microwave for a few seconds  blahhhh  trying to get something healthy i ordered the apple pecan salad  i swear the dressing came right out of the grocery store bottle  i could barely eat the salad  too sweetmy mom ordered a steak rollholy friedness  the steak was more like hamburger fried with cheese and then stuffed into breading that was fried again  yowzer  artery clogger for sure  i like the atmosphere  i like the bar area  perhaps next time well just stop by for drinks instead|when did dave and busters become a daycare everywhere you look there are signs that say kids must be accompanied by an adult but apparently no one was honoring that at pm on a saturday i couldnt even walk through the place without someone shoving me ahhhi get that dave and busters is an arcade and that youre going there to play some games maybe eat and kill some time when i last went there a few years ago we there for my bachelor party and while im sure we got into some shenanigans i dont remember children running wild there we were having adult beverages playing games and having a good time this time it was ridiculous it isnt chuck e cheese yet thats how parents seem to be treating the placeon top of that the customer service sucked the place is gigantic with tables and serving areas everywhere yet on a saturday at pm the hostess told us after interrupting us three times to chat with the other hostess told us it would be a three hour wait despite the fact that there were empty tables all over the dining room i suspect this is a ploy to get you to play games and spend money until youre table is ready but the food at dave and busters is not worth a three hour wait on any daythe hostess told us we could be served right away if we went to the midway and found an empty table so we attempted that most of those tables were empty with usually one or two adults at a giant empty table filled with coats who informed us that they needed the table because their kids would be back soon after playing games next i engaged in the most rudest thing ive ever done i began stalking tables where people were finishing up i would walk up to people paying their check ask if i could have their table when they were done and they would inform me that there were already two or three people who asked them and i should get in linefinally we found a table and proceeded to spend two hours eating dinner it wasnt because we ordered a lot of food it was that the waiter took forever to bring our food out he seemed to have no problem getting us fresh drinks until we drank as much as we could and then asked for water after that he seemed to come around a lot less i had the build your own chicken tacos which comes on a giant plate with all kinds of fixings the fixings were fresh but the chicken was cold and dry and the tortillas were dried out as well for  it wasnt worth it after dinner we proceeded to play games which entails shoving people to get through areas and waiting in line to play anything all in all i didnt like my experience at dave and busters i remembered it being a fun place to go and unwind as an adult but between all the kids and the crappy service cant recommend this place if anyone asks me to go back i may elect to stay home and poke my eyes with a fork|not really sure what to add  so ill bullet point my experience expensive poorly made drinks friendly but slow service ok food considering had the philly steak and cheese over run with kids before  that seem to have zero adult supervision  of the games were out of order air hockey big bball game  of the skee ball random other arcade machines expensive games fun time overall with the wife|dave and busters has to be split up into separate experiences to rate it dining  starsi had a party of  coming in i had called ahead of time and arrived early they immediately set up the table while about  of my friends and i waited the hostess after taking my name never spoke to us again she did not tell us when we could sit how long it would be or any other information and then they made us wait for  of our party to show up before they would seat us mind you there was no one else waiting and the table was ready and we were ready to order but they didnt tell us this i didnt even know why we were being forced to wait until i heard a supervisor whispering to the waitress about making us wait i still have no idea why we were forced to wait when my full party was finally seated we were helped by two waiters who were perfectly polite and nice but our service was rather haphazard people would order drinks and food and get things at wildly different times one person was done eating appetizers and drinks when another was just getting their first drink i know there was chaos to a big party but it got a little out of handthe food is pretty standard american chain food comparable to applebys and chilis  not offensive but nothing to knock your socks off it has a decent selection and a few good desserts and appetizers and everything was competently prepared overall it is a fine enough meal for a large group before going to enjoy the arcade at fairly reasonable prices but some of the service standards are poor in the future we will probably eat at one of the other restaurants in the area and then move over to dbs for gamesbar  stardrinks are predictably expensive but there is a wide variety the problem is that about half of them dont even kind of resemble what is on the menu and most dont have enough alcohol to even taste worse yet while you can get a drink at the bar in the arcade the staff is either completely noninteractive or just rude you have to track them down and then have a minimum of interaction before they stomp off like you ruined their lifearcade  starsthere are a lot of great games here to play and many that are fun with groups or pairs it is a great place for a large party because you can mingle with all your friends playing many different very fun games if you are a couple there are also many great selections that everyone enjoys the staff on the floor is helpful and fast to fix games that have problems and are typically polite the ticket prizes are cheap as expected but kind of fun and the people in the ticket shop were always nice and quick to helpoverall  starsif you want to hang out here i would suggest eating somewhere else and then playing games and having fun here but only order beer at the bar and dont expect a smile|chuckie cheese for grown upsyeah that could sum up my review for sure but ill try to make it a bit more interesting than thatfirst let me say that this isnt my first trip to a dave  busters  second i actually experience all of it while here  we will start with the foodservice  staff you were wonderful  you were polite you greeted us as soon as we walked in the door gave us no qualms while ordering and were swift with your delivery  food you were not wonderful  i ordered the bbq chicken breasts  this came with a side of broccoli and their type of mashed potatoes  the chicken was a bit dry and in some places you can tell it was left on the grill a little too long  there were actually some bites that all i could taste was charred meat  there wasnt enough bbq sauce on the the chicken either  the broccoli appeared to have been cooked prior and then thrown back into a pan to be seared  some of my broccoli actually had some burnt crisp areas on it  also i noticed that there were still some leaves left on the broccoli  the mashed potatoes i wanted to like which i hoped would be the best part of the dish im a bit of a potato freak but alas i was let down sad face they were cold and such a tiny portion  with a tiny amount of shredded cheese and bacon but into that divot they made with the scoop to get it out of its container  oh food how if i didnt need you to survive i wouldnt complain about youthe building right now is in disarray  they are in the midst of a remodel with lovely plastic curtains covering up certain sections of their dining area  no bar out in the dining area right now and the pool tables were absent as well  if you wanted a drink you had to go back into the game roomspeaking of the game room by far the best part  with the meal i ordered i got the  play card the best part of the meal super charge it for  more and its even better  the game room  you can tell is in need of an update  the carpet is worn and other signs of wear are noticeable as well  one good thing is the games  they change them up so often that there is always something new once you return  who knew that playing connect  could be so fun or for that matter skee ball rises to the top of my list to playi will return again but only after i eat elsewhere first|not being from the area i traveled an hour to come here from uniontown pa i was excited i havent been to this dave and busters since i was younger and was ready to go back and play me some games i went with my cousins mind you we hadnt ate all day and were very hungry so we decided to do the eat  play combo naturally heres where it gets bad first of all we get a very snobby hostess that shows us to our table then we waitand waitand finally after about  mins we get a waitress her name was ashley we had plenty of time to decide what we wanted so we quickly put our order in next we were sitting and talking waiting we had empty glasses and our waitress had never even come around to see if we needed refills except for one time she said shed come back right away with our refillsyea right  mins later we get our refills mind you our food still hasnt came yet i see other people getting their food that had come in after us i was frustrated after waiting  mins for our food i asked to speak with a manager one of the servers who i asked replied rudely with well hes really busy right now i doubt hell be able to come out and talk to you finally  mins laterthats one hour folks we get our food what do you think the next problem was yep the food was cold i was completely fed up at this point and told my waitress how disappointed i was especially after driving one hour just to have this terrible service the manager never came to speak with me and we didnt even receive our meals for free the only compensation we got were  game cards wooptydoo the only thing good about this place is the games but the prizes you get for your tickets are all junk and worthless so in conclusioni do not recommend the waterfront dave and busters of homestead pa it was horrible and i will not be returning for a very long time|i had fun here fun big kid games for meo but the bartender melissa was a super bitch and rude hope they fire her|first time at dave  busters and although i didnt go for the games i was slightly disappointed i went with a group of girls for dinner and drinks the service was slow but the food was decent the portions were huge but they are priced slightly higher than the average chain       we went before  pm and there were a ton of kids there on a friday night i do suggest if you want to avoid the children to go after |dave  busters  its a nice place to eat have fun and drink  all ages can enjoy this place  i was so excited to hear them announce that after p all children whether accompanied by a guardian or not had to go  it made for a nice evening for adults only  everytime we go whether we play or not we enjoy ourselves  i didnt give it four stars because every time ive went i havent been able to eat in the restaurant area of there  i know i still get the same food that everyone else does wherever you sit  sometimes i like the nice relaxing atmosphere of the restaurant  i havent as of yet been seated there  not to mention that the servers around the bar are a little slow at responding to customers as well  so all in all dbs is a good spot to stop at for food and entertainment  just dont expect to be seated in the restaurant portion and expect to wait awhile for food service in the bar area|was impressed by the new menu and new decor   our waitress was nice knowledgeable and attentive  however the rest of the staff was less than stellar  there was a power outage less than one minute while we were paying games sunny and calm outside so not sure what happened my family and i were playing a trivia gamewe lost about ten dollars of credits and all our bonus tickets when the power resumed   the games were down for about  mins after the outage and staff was not friendly when we inquired about what happened or when the games would be working again  after the outage two people in our groups could not get their power cards to work when we asked staff for assistance they just brushed us off and said we must have been out of credits  kinda a bummer we lost so much money on malfunction game play tonight|a fun place and lots to do but a bit pricy  will buy you a hundred points which will last you a little over an houri recommend the bowling game ball racing car game and connect  also there are several games that can be played in groups of |my boyfriend and i are in our s and have visited this db multiple times after our visit yesterday however i dont think well be back when we arrived we were greeted by a long line of people waiting to buy game cards at first there were  extremely slow workers trying to do this then one left while the line was still out the door the girl that was left was more than incompetent and was taking extremely long to fill these game cards we stood in line for over  minutes before being told that there was another attendant in the actual game room needless to say the line in the game room was just as long and they still only had one girl in the booth it was a saturday after we finally got our cards we had to wait yet again to get a beer  bartenders on staff while the bar was completely full it took us almost an hour before we actually could start gaming the floors were filthy with trash and the bathrooms repulsive i had to use the restrooms twice during our visit and not only did both bathrooms i used have no toilet paper in them but there was tp all over the floors and the sinks were less than cleanly my boyfriend mentioned that the guys restroom was no better as it smelled like pee and the paper towel dispenser didnt work all i have to say is get your crap together we could see a difference in the type of crowed that was there on saturday compared to what it used to be and im i have no doubt its due to the poor service and attention to cleanliness for how expensive they are they need to staff better on weekends its a shame how quickly this place has gone down hill and we will not be returning anytime soon|ehh   i cant rate it super low because i do smile a lot during my visits speaking of that ive been here a few times but never wrote a review for db im a kid at heart and honestly do enjoy the games however there have been multiple instances where i swiped my game card  it took my credits but no game began there have also been times that i won and no tickets were released i guess nothing is perfect but it does happen atleast once a visit each scenerio  its hard to find a worker walking around and for halfprice games you kind of just take your loss with the  credits for skee ball hmphthe food it really isnt anything too fancy ive had okay food but super long wait times for a simple chicken fingers  fries for example its your basic sandwiches salads appetizers  a few pastas i believe all sandwiches  burgers are around   served with fries  you can get the eat  play deal which includes food from a specific menu  a game card besides the game card deal if you wanted to make db a date night you might be better off heading to another place to eat in waterfront for amazing food but to each their own  try it once i suppose the brownie sundae that i devoured last night was satisfying  brownies  scoops of ice cream one with chocolate syrup the other with raspberry sauce  fresh strawberries oh  whip creamdrinks pretty weak we ordered  liquid maryjanes  each that is which are filled with multiple shots of alchy  didnt really catch a buzz oh welllll they do have a happy hour from pm id go during that time for the best deal i believe cocktails are half off   off  bottles of wine ive never seen anyone walking around with a wine glass though lol the prizes as others have noted the prizes are a little cheap for the amount of tickets they cost however its cool to leave with a db coffee mug cup or shot glass last night for  tickets we decided on magneticstyle dart board  a coffee mug a db glass our plastic one bit the dust  a db coffee travel mug i might be missing a few odds  endsoverall its a fun time but can be pricey its best to head here wednesday for half price games or get the eat  play deal while dining i cant lie though i find myself smiling ear to ear a few times within those  hours woah seemed longer than amount of time d  speaking of which in that timeframe we played  credits cost  but it was halfprice games|my wife and i went here around pm on a saturday night the food was not spectacular about the same quality that youd get at an applebees or some place similar  good but not great  my steak was tough but my wife enjoyed hers staff was relatively unorganized we ate at a table next to the bar and had to wait awhile for a server food was prompt|ok let me tell you about my bad experience first i went to db last night for a post wedding party  which side note is a great ideait was around midnight and the bar wasnt really populated there were three bartenders and only one was actually making rounds to see if anyone needed anything the two other bartenders were chatting on the far side of the bar that no one was sitting at kind of counter productive if you ask me i stood there for about  minutes which for a busy bar is fine but when i am the only one with my card out then it just seems a little ridiculous i made eye contact with the one girl twice and gave her a smile and she literally turned away i finally had to walk to them to get their attention  i was standing right in front of them smiling and they didnt ask if i need anything i finally said are you working and they gave each other a weird look i felt like i was the crazy one i asked for a beergot the beerin between that time the other bartender brought food over and set it down she took a fry from the plate right in front of me and then served it to someone on the other side of the bar what the hell i felt like i was in some grimy bar in out in the sticks  not an established db i was just really turned off from that experience the good is that db provides a different type of entertainment when you want to mix things up i remember going here with my grandparents when i was a kid and it was the best treat ever we would eat at the restaurant and then spend hours playing games this place holds some really good memories for me its a shame that my experience last night has spoiled the high standards i held for it|its fun but much smaller than some of the others ive visited  its clean staff is friendly and its a good way to waste time before a movie they do have good  food gets a  stars because i get bored easily at this location|i used to love db when it first opened in the waterfront but it has gone down hill over the years the games are not as fun and do not give you as many tickets and the prizes have gotten cheaper in quality it takes a whole heck of a lot of tickets for you to even get a pencil the atmosphere is okay but it used to be so much better with the funnest games and diverse groups of people now it is run down and many of the games are app related games fruit ninja and d experience rides with such games you cant even earn tickets and they take a lot of tokens last time i went back in the winter many of the games were broken which made for a negative player experience i would go to db to play some games again in the future but it is no longer one of my favorite places to go due to the decline of fun games where you can earn tickets|i recently stopped there with my girlfriend and her kids to celebrate her daughters s birthday i ordered the fish and chips dont order the fish and chips unless you want to lube your insides for months i know i probably got the one that got away and they refried it  times the outside breading was hard as a rock and had no taste the fish itself was bland after a few bites i called over the waiter who was very nice and funny and complained by showing him how hard the fish was by tapping the fish against the plate making a loud thud noise he grabbed my plate and took it to his manager but before doing so asked if i wanted something else i said no i had lost my appetite the manager came out looked around and walked right out of the area i was thinking he would have stopped but didnt oh well the waiter took my meal it off the bill i have eaten there before and the food was good sometime you just get one that isnt|my sister and law wanted to go here for lunch so all the kids could play games after we all had some lunch together this place is huge and was moderately clean except the bathrooms all of the food looked great on the  page menu when our food came though everything was below average they have a huge selection of games for the kids to play but you pay dearly to play games here the food is  overpriced and the drinks are drastically overpriced| stars for the fun factory games and all around experience but  stars for the disgusting food and horrible servicei was so excited to come here for my boyfriends birthday its always fun to play games win tickets and have fun with friendsfamily we decided to eat here before we played i keep seeing commercials for their new menu so hey it couldnt be bad right wrong only thing that was really good was the coronarita  but thats hard to mess up first off service was horrible i didnt feel like any of the areas were that packed to make the service so slow but apparently i was wrong it took about  minutes minimum to get our first drinks at least an hour for our food i have boneless buffalo wings which are hard to screw up so mine werent bad but they werent the best my boyfriend had their philly cheesesteak and he couldnt finish it was so salty and just not good for the price of everything it was not worth it all better off going somewhere else in the waterfront for food and then coming here to play youll save  time and frustration i guess they are also remodeling their price area so for now there is a makeshift area to cash in your tickets everything was pretty picked over which kinda sucked overall it was still fun and i am sure i will be back to play some more games|can we get a maintenance man  and a janitor  and a manager   no  oki had a good time at dave and busters but that was based mainly on the company i kept and not the venue   we went right when they opened for the day with the intention of playing some pool  we located the pool tables in an area that looked closed off so we went to the hostess stand to ask  she radioed for help got none and finally went in search of an answer our question  when she came back she said she couldnt find anyone but a manager would be out to talk to us   we waitand waitand finally just give up and go off to play in the arcade area   all but one of the card purchase machines were rebooting and the one we could use didnt work  it takes forever and finally gives up and directs us to a nonexistent ticketing attendant  so we again go off in search of someone to help  we flagged down a server who issued us a card  for  tokens and served us a few cocktails average prices though my rum and coke was teeny   and we are off to play some games  about every third game we tried was broken in some way  either the token swipe didnt work or the game itself was messed up   it also wasnt the cleanest place ive ever seen  they have tables around the place to set your drinks on but most of them didnt look as though theyd been wiped from the day before which of course makes we wonder when they last cleaned all the games that germy little kids touch all dayoverall they appeared completely unprepared for opening computers booting employees not ready to work soda gun at the bar not assembled etc and not well maintained or managed at all  the broken games were sort of comical after a while but definitely not in a good way  if you are really looking to do this type of activity id try a different location for sure|theres lots of potential here because of the wonderful character and ambiance of this place but the food was average at best  we were there on a pens playoff night and there were  people working all the tables in both rooms  our food came to us cold and unimpressive at that  our orders were somewhat mixed up  the potato skins used a really cheap artificial cheese that was not very appealing  i tasted a slice of pizza which is definitely the best thing they offer  the crust was delicious and homemade  if you are going to order something i would go with the pizza  we also ordered the chicken wings which were pretty good also  if you are looking for good food homestead better choices at blue dust or tin front|over priced over hyped but a hell of a time regardless  i think if you have a big screen tv at home and a wii you could order pizza get beer and have friends over and have the same experience without the price and glitz  ive yet to eat something here that impressed me  the arcade is a bit dated but i like playing the big trivia game more than anything again you could just invite people over to play trivial pursuit  the new tv set up is pretty cool but dave and busters is just what it is an adult chuckie cheese not worth more than a visit a year if that|fell asleep last night before i got a chance to do my review this place is pretty cool its just an arcade with a bunch of games they have a bar  u can order food as well the prizes have gotten better however there a few games that werent working|wednesdays are half off game night menu includes some meals that also provide ten dollar game cards its loud and crazy but thats what is to be expected the kids love this place its ok not my thing but i understand the fascination|i ate here for lunch today with my wife and  kids server was prompt getting to the table took our order and then disappeared our food took  minutes yet there was only  table with people who were dining grilled cheese salad and a quesadilla shouldnt take that long games were fine mens room didnt have any paper towels to dry hands with huge fail for this type of venue|i have been to dave and busters multiple times and i feel its a  star placei can say the food quality is sub par  in my opinion the food prices are expensive for what it is and quality  they do offer a nice barbut then again the prices in my opinion are a little higher  service isnt too bad but could be betterdb is a great place for adults for sure but the prices for tokes or game play is a little ridiculous  some games charge  credits to place  thats almost saying  a game and some of those games are addicting where i know most of us keep playing  i also thing db isnt the cleanest place either  the bathrooms near the arcade are always nasty in my opinion  doesnt seem like they keep up with it  to me thats a big factor in rating restaurants   all in all db is an ok place to visit but not a place i would frequently waste my money|had an awesome time here with my hubby the food was amazing but the games cost so much an the prizes where ok but all in all a good time ill be bring the kids with next time|the food was good but we waited an hour for our drinks then  hours food then an hour for our bill wont be back not busy at all so not sure what the problem was id hate to be there when they are busy|the food here is awful  i came with a small group of people for dinner one night before heading out bar hopping at a few places at the waterfront  we gave the server the benefit of the doubt because there were about  of us which can be challenging  i think the long wait time to get the drinks and then the food was due to the bartender and kitchen but the waitress really tried her besti only gave it  stars because i liked my mac and cheese  everyone else at the table hated their food  they all had sandwiches or other dishes  the one girl resorted to eating only the toppings off her sandwich because the bread was too hard to bite through  the kitchen probably made her sandwich right away and left it under the heating lamps for  minutes while preparing the rest of our tables foodi was tempted to stop and play games for a couple minutes but after my husband came out of the restroom he told me how about  other guys walked out of the restroom as well that had not washed their hands and immediately went over to start playing games  all i have to say is no thanks|eh i was disappointed the food wasnt so good and the place had a weird smell to it at least the waitress was pleasant probably wont be returning anytime soon unless they make some changes|i was sad to see of the bad reviews below because i love db however i was just there this weekend and has dinner then went to the midway the food wasnt bad but our service was overwhelmed so we didnt really have a server and there were a couple small errors with our order the bathroom was a wreck like always the trash can is always full floors filthy and smells strongly of urine half of the games i played wouldnt read my card on the first trybartenders were slow  didnt seem to care except for the manager ill be back for sure but this place needs some serious staff updating|summaryif i was in the area and no one had a better suggestion for where to go i might come back for beer and appetizersgood decent beer original pretzel appetizer  you take chunks of soft pretzel and dunk it in spinach cheese dip huge portions  most of us had leftovers  the rb appetizer sampler was multistory and way more food that we could handle  the half order of ribs looked like a full rack attentive service with quick seating and frequent drinkwater refills amusing namebad lots of food choices burgers steak chicken salads  lots of drink choices beers wines mixed drinks  i guess this could be seen as good but it takes a while for everyone to pick something and since no ones awesome at everything you could tell right away that nothing distinguishes this place none of the food was super awesome  nothing was awful but nothing stood out in any way  ive had better beer appetizers and a better main course at plenty of breweries kind of dead on a monday night with  of the place emptycome if you want bar food but keep your expectations low|i thought this place was pretty decent my friend and i were both still reeling from thanksgiving dinner so we ordered salads and they were huge and tasty i liked my salad though it was slathered in way too much dressing my friends was even more slathered so she didnt dig it too much wed also ordered chips with guacamole the guac was pretty good my friend enjoyed her beer i enjoyed my coke i know im lameso yeah wasnt bad wasnt the best but it was okay|microbrewed beers are only a plus to me when theyre better than the beer i would have drank otherwise  one waitress i had while there tried to split the uprights between macrobrew and trendy by describing one of their beers as kind of like coors light  if i wanted coors ill pay half as much and have one  the food is actually a saving grace as it was pretty good  head next door to sing sing for drinks though|not the greatest ale house in the city but certainly not the worsti like the food and i have tried all the beers  theyre just ok as far as beer goeslarge portions friendly staff|everytime i come here i stick with the nachos add chicken add side of guac and ive never been dissappointed  i sit in the bar grab a drink or  and eat those nachos  the bar has a pool table and plenty of flatscreens  rock bottom is a chain but its one of the better chains in the area  ill pass on chilis or fridays and come to rock bottom instead  oh and typically i walk over to target  work off some of those nachos|little slow on the service and didnt have the beer i wanted on the menu but you get those things when they brew their own beers onsite   but the stadium pretzels are good  the cream stout is tastythe burgers are good and big with the little skinny fries  im not a fan of the skinny fry but hey the burgers would choke a horse  and almost did  o|lately the rock bottom is hit or miss the beers are always good and the uppity jagoff ipa is one of the best india pale ales ive ever tasted the low point lately has been the food i will never forgive the idiot in management who took the chicken quesadilla off the menu that said i ordered the lobster roll and when it arrived the bread was as hard as a brick and cold the filling was okay but the lobster flavor was masked by over spicing i suggest you eat somewhere else and imbibe at the rock bottom|even since rock bottom opened  years ago i have always thought it was a dance club  i am not really sure why but i thought it was along the same line as throw back hitops but i did i think i always thought this place was a club because of the behemoth size of the space well i was out with a friend and we needed a place to go before a show at the improv and rock bottom was close part of this is my faulti always order healthy items at places that specialize is greasy bar foodthen i am upset when the meal isnt  star  i started off with one of their wheat beers it was alright i nursed it all through dinner so i dont think i was head over heels in love with it  i got the catch of the day off the hook fish dish sailors delight or somethingi forget it had some cheesy fish themed name  it was cod meh that should have been the sign not to get it with roasted asparagus and lemon rice  the fish was suppose to be broiled but it had a thick breading annoyed and the portion of fish was tiny the rice and asparagus were great though my friend got a chicken sandwich which he enjoyed although the fries were pathetic  the fries were probably precut frozen fries or just very poorly executed  they were so thin that you have to grab a huge handful just to get any actual potato flavorpros a lot of tables no wait brew special beers big menu could hear the dueling piano bar next doorcons place was fairly empty and we got a crappy table by the door when it was  degrees outside most of the food was fried cheese filled cream based or wrapped in bacon  i know some people love to eat food like this all the time i do every once in awhile but if you eat out a lot you cant always get the spin dip burger and ice cream sundae  i would love to but its just not in my cards i do like like when causal places offer some healthy options|heres the trick to enjoying a meal at rock bottom dont get fancy with your food order  stick with the sandwiches salads burgers and bar food and youll be ok  ive had bad experience will all the fish dishes including the fish and chips  also ive found the service is generally better in the bar area than the dinner area  join the mug club even if you dont go often and rack up points for free mugs and beers  thursdays are trivia nights and the dj is playing the music loud so go if you dont really want to have a conversation with the person youre with |went with a group after work for dinner and a brew  we ordered a few appetizers first  the wings are good and the soft pretzels with spicy spinach cheese dip was fun  had a burger you can create your own from veggie turkey or fresh ground beef had a fresh ground beef and the meat was fresh and cooked perfectly with a fresh bunthe brew pub is nice and was surprised it wasnt busier|i always feel like i am constantly bashing breweries for their food but in my opinion i feel the bar is raised for places like this it seems there are so many breweries out there that offer great beer and slack off on the food unfortunately rock bottom is one that falls into that category lets be honest when you go to a brewery you want the full experience if it was only about the beer id go buy a growler and take it home so about the beerexcellent the jagoff ipa is with out a doubt one of the best ipas i have ever had they only i can think of that i think is better is dogfish head but thats a matter of opinion the beer selection is constantly changing and they always have some excellent seasonal beers you cant go wrong theres bound to be a beer everyone will like as for the foodits pretty much a crap shoot sometimes its good sometimes its terrible my biggest problem is there is absolutely no consistency when it comes to the food one time its perfect then maybe its cold or its burned or it tastes completely different from the last time you had it unfortunately it seems there is zero attention to food quality thats pretty much it this place fixes its food consistency and its a five star place till then its hit or miss|i was so ready to like this place  turns out not so much  it was okay  no better than tgifridays but better than eat n park  the deetsthe hubster and i were here on a saturday evening after a show at the improv so we were happy and in a good mood and ready to enjoy some good eats  we ordered drinks  he a wheat beer of their brewing me my fave bloody mary with absolut peppar  the hubster deemed the beer acceptable but wouldnt go out of his way to come back just for another oneyes he did order another one just to be sure  my bloody sucked  watered down tomato juice with no discernible peppar of any kind let alone any other seasonings  even a good standard mix would have been better  our very efficient and friendly waitress took it back and watched while it was remade by the other bartender  nope no better at all  that went back and i went with a youcantscrewitup amaretto sour  it was finehub ordered a reuben  why ill never know because they simply never measure up to the gold standard of what used to be at the longlamented gazebo in shadyside  you younguns wouldnt have a clue of the establishment of which i speak  he said this one was fine  i had the texas fire steak with jalapeno butter which i enjoyed very much  packed a punch of heat and flavor but the sides were uninspired  steamed veggies  any flavor was steamed out in the process  eh  cheddar mashed potatoes  there was cheddar in there  no waythe tab was reasonable  we did have a living social deal that took  off so our check was for  and change not including tip  not bad even with the  cost of the ls deal but had we paid full price it wouldnt have been worth the experience  well hit the improv again  we have before  but well head somewhere else afterwards|i must admit i do like the brews  i also like the white cheddar mash potatoes  other than that meh  the food is pretty forgettable  another brewery that sadly fails to be anything special in the food department  with the restaurants upping the ante on th ave you may want to kick it up a notch rock bottom  but how would anyone know to  its a chain  whomp whomp|the only reason rock bottom gets  stars is because of the brews food was eh not many vegetarian options and hostesses who will ignore you because they are too busy chatting about who didnt text them back this place has the potential to be great but sadly it falls way too short in almost all areas|watch the fat girls in here they will try to steal your buddys chair in a sec if he goes to the bathroom  then the indignent fat girl had to get yelled at in front of everyone w in ear shot everything else including the burger  beers i devoured was excellent|i just came here with some friends to hang out and get some appetizer and i have to admit that i was pretty satisfied with what we got  though i couldnt find any fried pickles or onion rings on the apps section there were some blue cheese nachos that really hit the spot  the atmosphere of this seems pretty cool especially in the pub area|slow servicebelow average food ill pass|its not bad im not into chain kind of places but if youre with a group that doesnt do anything more adventurous youll do fine here i vacillated between  and  stars but the house beer i had will make sure i come back from time to time|rock bottom is a chain brew pub one that in my opinion is just ok  the restaurant is rather large with lots of seating and a pool table they have many of their own brews that you can sample but to tell you the truth none of them are that good i have had several of their beers and all of them have been forgettable their food is pretty much like their beers forgettable i have had one of their burgers and their pizza and they really werent anything to write home abouti feel they will impress those who have never been to a brew pub but i would probably describe them as the chilis of brew pubs if you are in homestead and are looking for a burger and a beer it might be a good choice for a bite or at least until the burgatory opens|dined in twice food ok atmosphere good|went here last night to meet folks for a friends birthday party docking one star due to a few unfortunate things that happened otherwise id be fine giving this place a our waiter was very attentive and kept our water and soda cups refilled the food was decent overall  i had a plain ol burger and a delicious berry sangria  and the place overall had a nice vibe to it and was pretty comfortable and fun to be inyoud think this would just be another average place notgreatbutnotbad and id be ready to go on to the next review right thereheres where i ran into problems id checked the website in advance to try and plan my meal since i do my best to pick items on menus that arent say  calories in one sitting their website advertises that they make skinny drinks when i asked my waiter he said it was possible but that they did not normally do this and that its a hassle for the people at the bar so he didnt recommend it then why tell us on your website that youll do it additionally while we had checked in advance when we made our reservation about bringing a birthday cake and the restaurants ability to handle us lighting candles apparently there was a break down in communication we never got the candles we had asked for and in fact the poor waiter struggled to even find a lighter before realizing there were no candles available obviously whatever error occurred wasnt the waiters fault and we definitely thanked him and tipped him well for doing the best that he could with what he had on a final note this is also one of those places where if you ask for a medium rare burger they will overcook it ive started ordering medium rare on purpose specifically so that i get a medium cooked burger instead of medium well or well donefinal verdict go for the brews if you must and the foods nice enough i was admittedly left a little underwhelmed|nothing special just like applebees chilis or fridays stick to the bar food burgers sandwiches pizza wings and salads and you will be okay this was our second attempt at trying rock bottom on fathers day the first time almost ten years ago we went in the early afternoon and they had already ran out of steaks how do you do that on fathers day this time we went around  noon and beat the rushmy wife got and loved the berry bash sangria she just said it had too much ice in it our daughter got the root beer float which she love and i started with a mango ice tea but later switched for a raspberry ice tea as the mango ice tea wasnt sweet enoughwe started off the the kobe beef sliders as our app it took at least  minutes to get them you get three sliders and they were very goodmy wife got a small greenhouse salad with jalapeno ranch dressing to start off with which she enjoyed and the lobster  shrimp enchiladas as her main entree she complained about how salty it was and the fact that there was no lobster in it at allour daughter got the kids burger and fries no surprise therei ordered the new york strip with mashed potatoes and it came with green bean as well my strip was cooked perfectly and has a decent taste longhorn has a much much better quality of steak though the green beans were pretty good and my mashed potatoes very bland and pretty average the kitchen sounded like an live episode of hells kitchen the waiters were repeatedly asking for orders at least  to  times the kitchen was backed up the whole time we were thereon a different note our waitress susan was very good come here for drinks and the bar food skip everything else|i went to rock bottom this past weekend and it was nice to see that nothing has changed in the year or two since my last visit while the beer is pretty good it has never outweighed the fact that the service isnt good and the food is average at bestit was even difficult to get beers at the barwe tried to have the girls order thinking theyd have better luckwhen that failed the men triedthat didnt work either if we hadnt really wanted a cold beer after a comedy show at the improv we wouldve just left it definitely wasnt busy enough to be noticed and ignored by the bartender so i cant overlook it of course the service has always been spotty at rock bottom so it was hardly surprisingcombine the weak food and poor service with rock bottom being too far from home for a night out just to drink and you get the exact formula thats kept me from going there in the pastand will keep me from going often in the future|normally the food is outstanding no more salted bread sticks but they did bring back the ball park pretzels  not very good cool to low warm hard dense  mango ice tea is wonderfulwill see how the chicken comes outto be continued|tom and i decided to try this place out before catching a late movie on a saturday night he is a beer buff and neither of us had ever been there so we gave it a gowe walked in around pm and we were told that there would be an hour long wait we put our names on the list and went shopping around the area about  minutes later our table was ready parking was a cluster since the lot is shared with dave  busters and a karaoke bar called sing sing tom dropped me off at the door so i could secure our tableour server jackie approached me almost immediately and brought two waters to the table to start she was very attentive and funny and probably the best part of our experience at the restaurant tom ordered a red ale and to his surprise didnt care for it jackie gave tom three free samples of beers she thought he would like after talking to him about his beer drinking habits he loved all three and chose the most bizarre and expensive beer jackie switched the red ale to the beer of toms choice and charged us for the less expensive beer very nice of herwe started out with the ball park pretzels with jalapeno dip the pretzels came out quickly and they were very fresh not to mention huge we only ate one and took the other to go very good app though tom ordered some sort of bacon cheeseburger and i got the chicken fried chicken which was a pounded chicken breast breaded and fried over white cheddar mashed potatoes with a side of gravy and some apple coleslaw  toms burger came with a small handful of fries and my meal was very spread out on my plate like something was missing not very good presentation at all the food itself was okay nothing to write home about the potatoes were my favorite part tom said that his burger was mediocreanother note the bathrooms are shared with the sing sing karaoke bar that is in the same building so expect drunk singing women in the bathrooms and bridestobe puking in the stall next to you after enjoying too much alcohol at their bachelorette party yuckoverall we might come back for the beer and service but not for the food and definitely not to use the bathroom|so after an evening of enjoying a comedy show at the waterfront we headed to rock bottom for some late night grub  the place was pretty busy we had to walk around the bar area for several minutes until a nice couple told us they were about to leave and we could have their bar table  as nice as this was of them it was awkward standing over them as they finished their drinks paid their bill and left  so finally seated i look over the drinks and being the huge ipa lover that i am i went with that and it was indeed a good choice  the hubby had the red ale which was also rather goodthe service was ok not the best not the worst  but moving on to more important thing the food  talk about missing the mark hugely  i ordered the mini street fish tacos  you get four mini tacos with a marinated in lime piece of fish and tomatillo salsa  they were just strokes away from inedible  i love fish tacos i mean it is such a simple concept so why do people have such a hard time executing this dish the shells were hard and literally split at the bottom when i picked them up  the sour cream sprayed all over the plate only made them messy and the poor fish was just so overcooked  if i wasnt so hungry i wouldnt have eaten them at all lesson learn on thatthe husband had the bbq chicken pizza  it had beans and corn with roasted red pepper on it along with some sour cream  my husband is usually the type that will order these lovely specialty pizzas and ask for them to remove all the wonderful unique toppings  for instance he would usually just say chicken bbq and cheese nothing else  i refused to let him do that this time because i was really intrigued in the combination of ingredients on this pie  and boy was i jealous when it came out  it blew my crappy tacos out of the water  should have stuck with something simple  furthermore i could care less if i come back to this location  the beers were good but hell you can get a decent ipa just about anywhere anymore  and the underwhelming food sealed the deal  i know this is a chain but it still doesnt have to stink|the food is standard american farea bit overpriced in my mindand the beers range from mediocre to very bad  the klsch is the only decent beer of the bunch  the service is good but the wait for food or a table can be quite long generally  minutes even for just beer and apps  ive been to the one at the denver airport as well but i was stranded and had free meal tickets so okaybutnothingspecial pizza from rock bottom it was  since its a recognizable national chain i think of places like this as more of a tourist brewery rather than a true pittsburgh craftbrew experience|the beer is good but the food is nothing to brag about at all ive tried many things on the menu and if you have developed a foodie palate dont even bother because you will be very disappointed if you feel comfortable with chain restaurants and their lack of innovative touch which nothing wrong with that you will most likely enjoy rockbottom the only entree i did enjoy were the lobster and shrimp enchiladas minus the repulsive beans and rice and the asiago crab dip as an appetizer otherwise you are better off skipping it|this place is quite big with a bar area dining room area and patio area we decided to sit in the bar area so we could watch some football on one of the many tvs they also have darts and two pool tables which i really enjoy when you are in the bar area you can see the beer being brewed through the window which is really cool i ordered the hibiscus wheat beer and my friend ordered the white wheat both of which are brewed by rock bottom they both tasted delicious and were exactly what i needed for a hot day my friend ordered the fried chicken entree which came with mashed potatoes and of course she gave me a few bites since we always share it was a pretty delicious meal but the fried crust fell off a few pieces which i am not really a fan of i ordered the sante fe salad with grilled chicken not fried the salad was okay i was expecting more flavors overall but i didnt really get them it was a good experience and will most likely be back when i am around the waterfront area|this is  a okay place to eat  the food is nothing special  i guess what they have going for them is the beer  order the  guacamole for the starter which was okay but for  and the portion was not worth it  rice cajun taco was not cooked well  would i go there again maybe  if your into beer and watching the game then yeah go there|nice enough chain restaurant  have ordered the fish tacos appetizer and the dinner entree of cajun fish tacos which comes with black beans and rice  both are ok though i think id order something else next time as im pretty picky about fish tacos  the appetizer tacos were rather dry  the cajun tacos were much better but executed oddly  they come in  shells  an inner hard shell and an outer soft shell  why might i ask  why add extra calories for something that seems so unnecessary and doesnt add to the dish in any way  oh well  cant speak about beer here as im not a beer drinkerthe space is pleasant and our server was efficient even if the meal wasnt the quickest to come to our table even though it wasnt busywould i revisit  probably it was decent enough with many other menu options  keep in mind however that there are many options nearby worthy of a visit|standard issue rock bottom  we ordered the nachosthey could have easily served  people  i have never seen a more massive platter of food  bar service was okayguy working there was nice to talk to about sports|my visits here are generally pretty consistent  i love getting the beer sampler even though ive drank all the beers twice over  i wouldnt say i have a favorite dish here yet but the food was always generally good  i guess one thing that sticks out is the chicken mac and cheese and the reuben  when i go here though im going for the beer more than the food  definitely worth a trip for dinner|for this occasion i was with my girls we were looking for a place to have a good lunch  we looked around and chose rock bottom we have eaten then before and enjoyed ourselves  the server was a very nice person and was very attentive  she when over the specials and took our drink order   going through the menu one thing that caught my eye was the bbq brisket stuffed burger  that just sounded so good  unfortunately the reality didnt match the idea of the burger  the favor of the bbq never came through and the smoked gouda flavor was none existent it was like having a standard old boring burger  i was very disappointed  for  i would have expected a lot more flavor  i would not recommend this burger unless they do something to bunch up the flavor|there are few local restaurants as popular as this place the food is consistently good and the service always great i meet people regularly at the bar we usually have dinner but lately thats not always the case the biggest complaint is that it seems the chef is intent on putting black pepper or some type of hot spice in all menu items|overpriced food is ok but way overpriced quantities are smallmuch smaller than the picture in the menu the beer is average but yes you guessed it thats overpriced too|its been a couple years since i first reviewed rock bottom and while i still dont love the place theyve definitely improved since then they admittedly still arent my first choice foodwise because by design theyre a pretty generic eatery for the most part especially compared to other options in the area their local brews are really the only thing that sets them apart from other places in the waterfront and pittsburgh has so many breweries and so forth now that even that isnt the biggest draw anymorethat said their brews are usually quite good and worth trying plus they are improving in terms of service and quality of food and that deserves a mention sure i may think their menu of burgers pizzas and american eats is pretty average but i also think the quality of the dishes is improving for example my burgers are no longer coming to me overcooked and as a result actually taste like a burger and not like a pile of toppings and a dry meat patty some dishes are even more memorable now i actually really like their veggie burger which is packed full of flavor that even i a known carnivore can appreciate and their fresh pretzels and dip absolutely amazing  exactly what youd expect from a warm pretzel fresh out of the oven i was especially impressed during my last visit by a server named mark who was incredibly attentive and came to our table regularly to check on drinks and keep us updated he never said a negative word and was quick to correct any mistakes or problems that popped up during the night if rock bottom hires more people like him there will be many more happy people coming and going from the place i guarantee itadd in the fact that this is one of a small handful of places that accepts reservations in the waterfront  a major plus when planning big outings with friends in the area  and you have a reliable place where a group of people can go after a movie shopping etc for food and drinks and for that rock bottoms earned another star in my book|was hoping for a great end of a day experience but things happen waitress seemed to have forgotten about us entrees came out prior to our appetizers entree of fish chips was a major disappointment fish was soggy and the chips were cold and grainystarters were comped but i doubt wed go back sad because it has the potential to be a home run hitter two stars and thats it|rock bottom a cautionary yelpers taleyou might say ive never heard of rock bottom theres no way that they are a chain restaurant beer apps bros sounds like a good time but be careful or youll end up on the rock bottomafter a  minute wait staring at half of an empty restaurant with the usual goofy decor you would find at a buffalo wild wings we were finally seated we could feel the tension from other diners that something wasnt right the manger was running around apologetically and the food was casually sunbathing under the heat lamps we immediately ordered a few apps but just like got and now our watch beginswe waited and waited to finally receive the saddest tiniest plates of food with bloated chain restaurant prices the food was uninspired tired and ordinary the only reason why i am giving them  stars is because of the extremely gracious and apologetic wait staff who took off  of our meal due to the terrible service so if you have decided to take a seat at rock bottom take comfort in knowing that even the staff seems to know your pain|while this is certainly not my first meal at rock bottom this is my first meal in a year or two  the wait was minuscule and the greeter was pleasant as always it is a haircut weekend so the twin carnivores the mother in law and i decided to tie the feed bag on at rb our server matt was easy to work with and informative i started off with the tortilla soup spicy and thick it went down easy enough however let me say that the price at  was rather steep for the serving size did somebody say ouch thing one and thing two each had the small fry steaks  with fruit cantaloupe melons and grapes and steamed broccoli and at  each i think i was buffaloed if  you get my drift the steak consisted of three small thinly sliced pieces of  hmmm they say that kids say the darnedest things well thing one noticed that his steak was very very gristly and thing two noticed that his was rather dry not the best dinner they have eaten they say you get what you pay for or not  my meal consisted of the chicken bacon mac  cheese  and at  i had no complaints it was filing hot and load with chicken and bacon how can anything be wrong with that much bacon the final dinner consisted of chicken fried chicken and at  my mother in law was sated over all this meal was a wash if anyone from rock bottom corporate reads this you may seriously want to rethink you portion sizes as you know i vote with my feet and dollars and neither will be there again any time soon|this is another one of my favorite places that had deteriorated dramatically corporate decided to get rid of the core beers and the beers now suck the menu has gone from something for everyone to a couple of overpriced entrees and a bunch of small plates that are ok but not great the service has also suffered tremendously we are abandoning this restauranti dont expect this rock bottom to be around too much longer  in the past on nights when the pirates were playing out of town the bar and the restaurant would be packed  last night it was only slightly busy  you can usually tell when an eatery is suffering by the amount of staff on a given night and the conditions of the bathroom  the staff was overwhelmed and the bathrooms were filthy and in serious need of repairs  alas i dont think that rock bottom will still be in business in six months  hopefully if that happens black rock bar  steak house will find its way into pittsburgh|for a chain it is better atmosphere than you would expect  the menu options all sound delicious but the food quality is not great  just mediocre|stopped in for dinner an bellied up to the bar the bar tender was quick to get me a beer the  pepper ale which was really good but after that i was totally ignored tried to get the attention of the two bartenders for about a half hour while nursing my beer they seemed to be more interested in changing dollars for quarters and washing glasses i got feed up finished my beer paid my tab and went to unos glad i did got great service and my meal came quicklyverdict  sit at the bar for a beer if thats what you want but if youre hungry and want dinner take your chances at a table|service is good staff is friendly and knowledgeable beer and cocktails are good as well foodnot so much  my boyfriend and i shared the jalapeno pretzel appetizer which was pretty good but our entrees disappointing  i got the baja chicken sandwich and he got the bison burger   both were super dry i could not even finish half of mine he had to drench his in ketchup to be able to get the bison burger down if i were to go back it certainly would not be to eat|meh is the only thing i leave here feeling  i ordered the classic burger because nothing on the new menu excited me  for a side  i requested the seasonal veggies trying to be healthier and was told its a squash mixture  great i love summer squash  i received a poorly seasoned burger the bun had the most flavor which is a sad statement  it was topped with an olive and a mini pickle odd  my squash side was lacking squash instead all squash was replaced by peppers which i cannot eatour server was nice  the beer was simple  with new breweries and restaurants popping up in and around homestead perhaps rb should reconsider their flavors|apps were good service was average and the certified angus beef tips were awful  they were severely overcooked and the sauce they were in had no flavor  the picture on the menu made it appear you get a good amount of tips  however i was given only  tips which in the end i was thankful for because if i had any more i would have had to rest my jaw for a couple days due to the extreme toughness and amount of chewing required to swallow those flavorless tips|overpriced food is ok but way overpriced quantities are smallmuch smaller than the picture in the menu the beer is average butbyes|loved the american blonde and grams oat soda ipa  good service    egg rolls were very good  our bar tender was very attentive and helpful in selecting the beers|if your in the market for a beer or two this could be an option they have a nice seasonal selection and its all tap which i prefer i also like that most of the seating is booth on my visit the service was lack luster i have no idea where the waitress went for half the meal and her listening skills left much to be desired i went with a beer sampler it was nice being able to try everything they have i of course went with the pumpkin beer for my main dish i had stuffed peppers which i honestly enjoyed they had a great flavor my only issue is the rice that came with it was a bit under cooked if service was better and my rice was cooked i would have given this place a solid  stars but that unfortunately wasnt the case on this particular visit|came here on a saturday night waited over an hour for a table for  but enjoyed some great beers from the bar while waiting ordered the calamari appetizer to start which was very good my fish and chips entree was cold but my boyfriends  am burger was phenomenal|good club for a good laugh high food prices most comedy clubs are  item min the food was less than stellar i wouldve enjoyed burger king more service was decent i believe the waiterswaitresses could hustle a little more or the club should hire more waiterswaitresses i get grouchy when my glass is sitting empty for more than  mins|they have good acts coming around here and often give out free tickets particularly ine summer ive never actually paid full price for a ticket here the twoitem minimum is bit bothersome to me thoughi dont mind the requirement so much but the quality isnt good and the prices are high our four items total came to about  two appetizers and two beers and the apps were really nothing to write home about and the servers arent even very friendly also bewarethey have a lot of rules here they wont seat till the whole party is there if you get dinner reservations everyone in the party has to order dinner automatic gratuity added to the check etc etcthe box office is also weirdyou get your tickets at this window complete with microphone and slideunder slotthen you walk into the club and the box office is completely open and the workers are just sitting right there so i dont get the whole hoopla with the windowall in all though the seats are comfy enough the atmosphere is pretty nice and the acts are good|came here to see charlie murphy parking was nightmare i would expect nothing less on a saturday nightthe  minute wait to get inside was torture they need to implement a system where if you purchased tickets in advance you dont have to wait outside once inside you we were seated pretty quicklyseating is first come first servethe server was pretty quick to take our orders i misread the menu description and didnt realize my bbq sandwich came with cheese  i dont eat cheese and had send my order back the waiter was gracious and returned with my modified order in about  minutes ive never heard of throwing cheese pulled pork sandwich maybe its a northern thing we got our checks quickly and without issue|ive been here twice now and like the others you really only come to improve comedy club for the show very reasonably priced for shows  though they have the two item minimum so would suggest they all be drinksthe food leaves little to be desired we decided for the sake of time to grab dinner at the venue since the show started at  having a free appetizer coupon we ordered the spinach and artichoke dip along with the sauteed grilled chicken spinach and artichoke dip was good though cheesy rich along with cheese sprinkled on top of the chips sauteed grilled chicken  hmmm i think the chicken was frozen  definitely not fresh  and the guacamole was artificial with a glop of cheese it looked like a mess with big ole pile of fries a lot of food for  service has always been pleasant though they do automatically tack on the tip for you at |theres nothing like a saturday night filled with some good laughs a few chuckles and a couple of good guffaws thrown in for good measure  thats exactly what we enjoyed on saturday nightwe hit the comedy club for an evening of tammy pescatelli  the hubby and i have enjoyed her routine on tv and on the occasional dve morning show  she didnt fail to give us a good evening of laughs  the big surprise was gene collier  yep of the postgazette sports writer fame  as the opener  what a great opening act  he cracked wise about the perils of being  and a baby boomer  we could relatethe sightlines were lacking  there was a rather large woman at the table in front of us with massive pittsburgh big hair  all night long my own head bobbed from side to side as i attempted to actually watch the show and not just listen to it as she reached repeatedly and unceasingly for her tableful of snacks  with a  drink minimum my first drink was weak and the nd was quite strong  all in all the two balanced each other out  but then you dont go for the drinks do you  an enjoyable evening|tom green was appearing here on jan   he was hilarious the improv is an excellent comedy club in past shows ive seen jim krenn margaret cho billy elmer and so many more i forget much like live from the improv on tv the brick back drop makes it feel like the nyc improv hint eat elsewhere the food isnt so great have an appetizer until you get to another restaurant most comedians head over to the rock bottom after to imbibe dave attell is a regular at both places two drink minimum drink them slow and go elsewhere after the show|the place does what it does best  comedy  the food however  blahfirst off if you go to a show please note there is a two item per person minimum  this means that from their extensive menu of overpriced bar food and drinks you are required to choose two items each    second the sodas are not free refills  i learned that one the hard way  get water third before tipping your server please make sure she hasnt already taken her cut out  even after paying for two very bland overpriced meals and way too many diet cokes i thought that my bill was rather high  upon further inspection i noticed that my server had taken an  gratuity  the menu explicitly says that an automatic gratuity will be taken out for parties of six or more but there was only two of us and we werent even drunk  i found this tactic awfully presumptuous and left her tip at the  even though i typically tip well over     overall i dont like the idea of being required to purchase food just to see a comedy show  i can see why they do it but if i were required to buy a crappy popcorn and overpriced pop every time i went to the movies i would be far less inclined to go as i am not inclined to go to the improv again|decent clean as far as i could sense in the dim about on par for what youd expect for a higherend comedy club  that includes the drink twodrink minimum automatic  gratuity and the comic spouting out the obligatory dont forget to tip your waitresstrying to judge the place on its own merits and not on the entertainment value of the comics  if the latter since we were here for frank caliendo id have given the place the full  stars if only for him alonetotal cash bled out of my pocket brought it down from what could have been a star experience for us   for tickets online included  service fee and tax we had to this was a sold out show  add  for drinks gratuity and more tax  were talking digits of  for less than  hours of entertainment squeezed in between other patrons and glasswielding servers while you sit on rickety chairs  thats what a headliner act will cost yawill you see us here again  probably but cost makes it unlikely to be a weekly thing for us|i love the improv i think its a great way to start or spend a night nothing like a laughter filled night i think its great that we get so many great comedians coming our way owen benjamin pablo francisco super funny tammy pescatelli not so muchthings you should be aware of the staff is really strict on the  drink minimum so be prepared to spend money on the pricey food and drinks i kinda wish their menu was a little bit more extensive their service is spottythe wait staff is a little iffy i have been here many times and sometimes i get an attentive waitress and sometimes not most recently our waitress was rude didnt bother with pleasantries and barely took notice of us also beware of the fact they automatically add gratuity if our waitress was nice i would be more than glad to add to it but this time i was like no wayps when i used my groupon i didnt have any trouble|the pittsburgh improv is unfortunately another great idea hamstrung by the details of mediocre execution some specific examples at the endthe setup is nice a delightfulif a bit sterilereproduction of what youd think a comedy club should like if you watch enough tv  the interior is clean the seats are comfortable and its an ok atmosphere to see a show and laughits too small however to attract many of the best acts which limits its ability to ever become the central hub for pittsburgh comedy  most of the big names that have recently come through pittsburghjim gaffigan louis ck second cityall perform elsewhere though they managed to get bob saget to their creditbut the biggest problem is the food and drink  theyre very up front about their mandatory two item minimum but the forced service requires that you spend extra money and get interrupted by waitstaff at least several times during the show  the prices are well above what id consider reasonable given the quality and id begrudginglyor even happilyjust shrug off the cost the same way i would a stadium concession stand markupbut the food is bad  youre forced to either a buy extremely overpriced drinks  for a soda for example with no refillsor ten dollars for one with refills or b buy moderately overpriced food which you wouldnt want in the first place  i thought the ten dollar chicken sandwich looked reasonable until a few bites in i decided id rather just throw away the money than keep eating itstill i think this place has a lot of potential the core idea is very workable and they do attract some really good comedians  two stars for now with high hopes for improvementsa few specific drawbacks which could be very easily fixed  a lot of the drinks didnt have prices on them  i know this isnt uncommon but at a venue where every question you ask interrupts not only your own showviewing experience as well as the experiences of your neighbors its an incredibly poor decision here  make everything on the menu exceptionally clear  its not that hard  put the drink prices on the website too  an improv representative has personally responded to many of these yelp reviews and she once said our menus and pricing are listed on our website which makes for easy planning  im calling shenanigans  not all the prices are on the website which makes for difficult planning  reminding me to tip my server during the show and adding an automatic gratuity to the check makes me feel like youre trying to trick me  its kind of an unprofessional way to say goodbye to ones customers  since the  soft drinks dont come with free refills the servers shouldnt ask would you like a refill on that or anything of the sort  they should ask would you like another one instead  they should also respond to requests for refills by saying we dont offer refills but id be happy to get you another one  just because theres a  dollar refillable soda option on the menu doesnt mean people all figure it out  most patrons dont even bother reading the beverage section of the menu if all they want is a standard beverage offered almost everywhere like a cola or diet cola and the reading difficulties imposed by the darkness make them even less likely to browse the offerings|my husband and i went to do something fun the comedy was great  the food however is mediocre at best in addition we were seated in the last row and  minutes into the headliner they sat someone else at our table so that they were in front of us i could not see a thing when we received our check they had added an  gratuity without permission or notification  i will not be returning anytime soon|who doesnt love to laugh the improv is a great place to go for a good show a few times a year the venue is clean the comedians are good for the price and many times you get a steal and can see a great comedian for a low price ietommy johnagin however be advised if you attend more than one show every couple of months you will see some of the same opening acts repeated this is my biggest gripe with the improv ive been to the improv about  times over the past  months and have seen the same opening acts a few times i think they cycle through the same  comedians are there not more talented comedians in pittsburgh as noted in other reviews another area of improvement is the drinks and food i always attend the late showing so that i can eat elsewhere the food is mediocre bar food at best nothing more needs to be said about that i definitely dont mind the two drink minimum ive been known to consume more than two drinks in one setting but the drinks are insanely overpriced  for a miller lite  for a snapple  for a fountain drink with refills youre better off having your two drinks during the show and going over the sing sing after for a draft    or four in addition since they started offering a large groupon discount the improv has been packed be aware that if you only have two people in your party they may seat strangers at your table who are  feet tall and block your view|im huge snl fan so naturally if someone whos been in the cast is touring ill come here to see them some have been really greatjim breuer some have been surprisingly very badtracy morgan but its always been a pleasant experience at the venue  theres not a bad seat in the house and its small enough that you get to see and hear everything from the stage  beware if you sit in the very front you know whats going to happena couple downsides waiting outside in a line in the dead of winter  the lobby is so small youre forced to wait outside until the first show starts or the first show lets out  and if you want a good seat you may be waiting in line for a while  burrthe two drink minimum i kinda get why they do it to make money of course but this means they jack up the prices of watered down drinks better to stick with beer and wine at these places no frou frou drinks for me also as to be expected the foods not that great in a perfect foodie world places that served food would make it fantastic since thats not going to happen you just go into those places hoping for the best ive never had anything great here nacho platter too many re fried beans to little nachosannnnnd im out so what did we learn here good venue stick to beer and wine and eat at a better restaurant beforehand the talent is really what youre there for so enjoy the show|spent new years eve at the comedy club to bring the new yeari am new but it was a good time   we had unlimited champagne fruit and cheese   the comedy was goodthe service was greatthe atmposhere was okay but it was a comedy clud    you should check it out  comedy clubs bring a little spice to the city enjoy|we came to the improv for the first time on friday night for my wifes work holiday party we arrived early for dinner and drinks from a predetermined menu dinner started with a salad of clearly bagged almost brown iceberg lettuce with some croutons and frozenthenthawed looking tomatoes that were pinkish at best i took a few bites of this unappetizing poor excuse for a salad and i can tell you it was downright tragic dinner arrived and since there wasnt any vegetarian options on this predetermined menu we received a dish that was supposed to contain meat with the meat omitted it was a huge pile of spaghetti in a bowl it looked sloppy and tasted worse than it looked the pasta was overcooked and the tomato sauce was just watered down pured canned tomatoes i saw traces of onion in my dish but didnt taste them at all i was so hungry that i salted the heck out of this abomination and took a few bites yuck i didnt make a dent in this crapfest for dessert we were given a choice of chocolate cake which my wife ordered and cheesecake which i ordered the chocolate cake had freezer burn inexcusable it wasnt edible the cheesecake was only a hair better but it had obviously come out of the freezer as well i know people arent coming here for the food but if you are forcing them to order things off of your menu to fulfill some outdated requirements two drinktwo menu item minimum then at least make some halfway decent food it doesnt even have to be memorablejust not offensive which it was had i paid for any of this i would have made a huge stink but i tried to be polite and push my food around and make small talk the comedians were good the venue was niceish and we got to sit in the front because we arrived early for our event not always the best thing in a comedy club we only got picked on a little bit but damn i was hungry i found myself fantasizing about all of the crappy waterfront restaurants and how id rather be therehow id rather be heating up a discount microwave dinnerhow id rather have a giant bowl of captain crunchhow id rather go back in time and eat spaghetti from my high school cafeteriawhat a dreadful dining experiencemy car was also violated in the parking lot i had an adorable german license plate on the front of my adorable german car which was stolen while i was eating hideous food which was just the slap in the face i wanted when finally retreating to my car i feel sick in so many different ways about this experience as a wholethe improv should consider outsourcing the food prep to a catering company i truly believe thats the only thing that can save this place do yourself a favor and eat beforehand and just order a beer well two i guess other diners at our table complained about the quality of the cocktails so id steer clear of those unless there is a cant miss type of comedian here i cant ever picture going back to the improv id give the comedians  stars and the food zero stars|i love that we have a great comedy club in pittsburgh with a great location at the waterfront  perfect for a date night and i recommend going to a later show and grabbing dinner beforehand  i received an online coupon code for  tickets for john heffron what a dealdef check for deals before you pay full price for any shows here  we went early to pick up the tickets at the ticket office  people were lined up outside about an hour before the show and it was freezing out  i had no interest in doing this so we grabbed a beer across the street at rock bottom once they opened the doors  minutes before show time the line went quickly and even though we were at the end we still got seated at a table in the back  it is not huge inside so there arent really any bad seats  they usually have an mc for the night who starts  warming up the crowd this guy was funny and so was the opening act before john heffron  my only complaint about this place is that they have a two drink minimum and the prices are outrageous   for a mixed well drink and  for draft beers  the soda was  yikes  at least we didnt pay full price for the tickets|my husband and i love going to comedy shows and have seen some pretty good acts at the improv ticket prices arent bad either i am very particular about where i sit and the person who seats you is willing to let you sit where you choose especially if its on a thursday or sunday night since those arent particularly busy nightsi did have one bad experience which is why im giving this review  stars instead of  it only takes one poor experience people my husband and i went to see one of our favorite comedians on a thursday night there is a twoitem minimum so we decided we would just eat dinner at the show well we were mistaken first of all our waitress was rude and slow after sitting there for  or  minutes without service she finally comes over and asks what we want we both order a drink and food to which she tells us that the kitchen caught on fire earlier that day so all they have are salads and desserts i was annoyed that she even asked what we wanted instead of starting out with this important factat any rate i order a caesar salad and a beer it comes out and its iceburg lettuce with shredded cheese tomatoes and other veggies in other words a regular salad i inform the waitress of this and she seemed totally confused i suppose she did not understand the difference which was odd overall i felt that there was no apology for the fact we couldnt eat let alone everyone else in the place salad or dessert arent the greatest choices when you are expecting to eat dinner at the show i think the improv should have waived the twoitem minimum on this occasions even if it cost them money afterwards i emailed the improv with my concerns never heard backthat being said i will most likely return to the improvbut not for the service because its a great place to see comedy shows and isnt that expensive customer service is terrible|if the improv chain didnt bring in such amazing comedians this place would be totally screwed i always have fun watching the comedians but i cant help but leave with such a bitter taste in my mouth from how much of a rip off this place isfirst you buy the tickets but if you buy online you have an outrageous service charge the real kicker is having to buy a minimum of  items during the show beers are  or  and the cheapest things on the menu i believe cocktails are  i think glasses of wine are around  there is a pretty good selection of food options the improv does have a lot of great comedians who pass through even the opening acts are generally great line up early if you want a great seat right in the front the point is a night at the improv will be fun but if you arent prepared for it it can end up being a pretty unexpectedly and unreasonably expensive affair|sowe got here and seated by pm orders placed drinks served now it is pm one of my party has still not received his chicken sandwich i hadmy shrimp diablo it was as described spicy and good but hour plus for a chicken sandwich is unacceptable we also sent an order of chicken fingers backdryer than sand and my fiancs chicken caesar salad chicken was as dry as the chicken fingers barely edible in fact she didnt eat more than  pieces of it upgrade the food service and this place would be somewhat a lil better|its sad that this the only place locally to see national comedy acts other than the big uns in the cultural district i hate this places mo the space itself is fineonly a few blind spots nice intimate venue they bring decent acts in although they have a lot of repeats and need to bring in more new acts but the two item minimum just infuriates me overpriced shitty food and drinks we went to see lachlan patterson last night hilarious show very nice guy signed our cd and posed for photos with people we dropped  on a chicken quesadilla  hot wings and  yuengling drafts the whole time i just sit there thinking about all the amazing places i could have eaten for  burgatory is right down the street hell tgi fridays would have been better ive been to other comedy places in other cities and they often have minimums but everything is either a lot cheaper or a lot better quality  the improvs saving grace is that they often have free or very cheap tickets|the food is why i give them three stars  burger was processed and  raw loaded fries where some random cheese  comedy depends on who you see|weve been to the improv comedy club twice now and both shows were amazing even the opening acts the only downfall is the two drink minimum which i understand but their prices make it ridiculous we stuck to beer because we knew it wouldnt be watered down our waitress was horrible we did not have an opportunity to order our second drinks until the other waitresses were bringing out checks if our waitress was more attentive the club could have made more money off of us oh well i would recommend eating at a restaurant before the show because the food menu is limited and overpriced the only other thing im not a fan of is the seating we were fortunate enough to get there early and have the back of a booth the last few people who arrived got the turned around seats in front of us i feel that the club should invest in long thin tables like bars have so everyone has a surface to put their food or drinks overall we love the comedians so well definitely be back|roxy was very funny would definitely come back to see her|positives they regularly bring in national acts  i have seen many of my favorite comics here  also you get an opportunity to briefly meet the entertainers on your way outnegatives drink prices are high and food quality in respect to the price is disproportional  entertainerwise there is a local comic who opens up for many of the main attractions  i have seen him open up no less than four times over a span of  years and his act is exactly the same every time  i have it almost memorizedcontinue doing the things you do well and try to improve the things that almost everyone on yelp complains about and youll be looking at  stars from most  no one wants to come to the improv to get straint up see what i did there improv|i love a good night of comedy but recently i have gone to a couple and they were not all that funny one was a special event too i would recommend eating at another restaurant prices seem to be a little over priced|nice giant eagle not as nice as their new market districts but you can look at this giant eagle and see how they came up with the market district idea and rolled with it fresh made sushi good cheese selection awesome bakery|wahhhhh theyre remodeling this one and its frustrating i swear i dont mind change i really dont  i should have seen this coming  there were telltale signs of this happening first they switched the pharmacy to the other end of the store where the now defunct iggle video was thats aok with me i didnt use the pharmacy anyway but then then they moved the whole toiletries section over there they put my spaghetti and ethnic food section by the way i love that ethnic food includes spaghetti to where my tylenol was my kitty food is now where my spaghetti once was can you tell how exasperated im getting did i mention i dont mind change but heres the thing i really hate grocery shopping its kinda sorta my own fault because i must read every label to make sure im not eating something with  grams of fat and  calories even though ice cream may go into my cart from time to time so going to this giant eagle frequently was nice because i knew were everything was now i dontwahhh ok ill stop crying i know ill eventually be back im sure  it will be an even better more magical grocery shopping experience once theyre done but i cant take it for right now ill be forced to shop at the ghetto bird down in the southside until my former  store is all shiny and new again|this place has amazing selection when it comes to some things and zero selection when it comes to others  we popped in here a couple times over the weekend i spent in pit and both times they didnt really have what we were looking for  visit  liquid smoke  visit  hawaiian rolls  i know these items must exist in pa just not geagle  they did however have crazy selection when it came to things likecorned beef brisket or anything that has potato in it  my californian mind was boggled by the variety of brands and cuts of corned beef that were available  too bad that wasnt what i was there for|let me preface this by saying i generally compare all grocery stores to publix maybe even kroger that being said the one thing giant eagle ge has going for it is the quality and selection of items there is no question that it has everything you could want thats where the praise ends lets just do this numerically prices are outrageous if you walk  yards over to the target next to it youll find some of the same items for  cheaper a bag of gevalia coffee is  at ge the same coffee at target is  and its not just coffee and not just target giant eagle has little other grocer competition in pittsburgh this being the case if youre not near an aldis target or walmart you have to go to ge for stuff theyre banking on this lack of competition  parking lots are thrashed every day all the time now maybe you dont care but when i go in the morning theyve been open maybe  minutes and there are shopping carts littering the parking lot and the sidewalk in front of the building they clearly dont bring them in at the end of the night they also rarely have any small baskets near the door youll need to hunt for one its just laziness and a lack of care on both accounts they dont care about the appearance of the outside nor the convenience for the customers  i dont normally mind the selfcheckout but only if i have a limited number of items if i need a full grocery order im going to have to wait in line for one of the two cashiers working the registers on a saturday the lack of customer service in this regard is atrocious im already paying exorbitant prices but i also have to ring up and bag my cart full of groceries too walmart doesnt even make you do thatso thats about it if you dont mind paying much higher than average grocery prices ringing and bagging your cart full of groceries and generally being an afterthought as a customer than giant eagle in waterfront is awesome|ive stopped by here a few times most recently tonight to pick up random groceries  this store is located next to one of the bike trails that i frequent hence its convenience despite being fairly far from my apton the positive side i appreciate the size of this store and the selection of products  in terms of size its larger than the shadyside market district my normal grocery store hence my standard of comparison and id say the product selection is very similar  unlike the md when ive visited the aisles have seemed fairly empty of customers which may be due to the times of my visits usually between pm as well as the size of the store  because its not a market district the prices are a bit less expensive which is niceon the negative side the checkout always seems to take forever due to slow customers andor employees despite that ive only purchased a couple of items at a time  the express lanes move at the speed of molasses and the selfcheckouts are even worse  speaking of which this store has way too many selfcheckout lanes about a third of the lanes and the nonexpress ones with the belts are unintuitiveprior to tonight i would have awarded this store a rating of  or perhaps even   however checkout tonight was even more of a pita than it usually is  none of the normal express checkout lanes were staffed with cashiers despite that i saw at least one employee loafing around talking to another  so i was forced to use one of the many selfcheckout lanes  normally i dont mind this esp when im only purchasing a couple of items but the empty selfcheckout lane that i spotted was one with a conveyor belt and i couldnt figure out how to use it not that it mattered since i had only one item but the selfcheckout lanes must be operated using a very specific proceduresee below  so i moved over to one of the express self checkout lanes similar to those in the shadyside md which i knew how to operate  however i still managed to bungle the process since i forgot to scan my one item before i put it on the scale that doubles as a bagging station so i had to wait for one of the eversoslow employees to come over and key in an authorization code so i could payim not sure if the selfcheckout stands that ge uses are standard in the industry since ive never used them anywhere else but i hate the whole weighingbagging process  in order to use the selfcheckout stations each item must be scanned and then placed on the scale and if the weight isnt correct for any reason including using your own bag an employee is summoned to check it  i assume the intention is to prevent people from shoplifting but  its a major pita for both customers and employees  most of the employees including the one i dealt with tonight dont care and just key the code without even looking at the error message explaining why they were summoned and  i doubt most shoplifters pay for any of the items theyre pilferingthey most likely just stuff them into their purse clothes etc and walk out  rant stars|i dont know why but i just cant like this location very much  i lived in the area for a little over three years and would always go to another ge before this one  maybe its the way its set up or maybe its the way that the lighting seems so very dimthe selection is typical for any ge broad and expansive  some prices are a bit steep  this location like many others has expanded their pharmacyhealth care area  which is nice it saves an extra trip to a drug store|i drive near this giant eagle on my daily commute so i shop at this location approximately onceweek the location is pretty and the beer selection is descent they carry my favorite lambic so i really cant complain they also have a very nice health and beauty section overall they usually have the products that i needmy only complaint would be wait time to check out they never have enough cashiers at peak hours the store has like  checkout lanes but generally only  open at a time i always dread checking out and whenever i see that checkout lines look relatively clear i hurry around the store and quickly gather the products that i plan to buy|i still cannot believe that pittsburgh has no independent bookstores  as a result of this i have ended up spending a fair bit of time at this barnes and noble location  as with all barnes and noble stores it has a cafe and a decent selection of popular titles  i am a bit surprised at how smallish it is compared to other stores in this chain  the bargain section seems to be perpetually picked through  the selection is ok in that it is well stocked but sometimes a bit disorganized from other customers pawing through the books less popular titles are a bit hard to find  the customer service here is pretty goodthey could use more chairs|great barnes and noble location and they have plenty of books thatll help you pass the time|barnes  noble its like the walmart of bookstores  beating down the competition of other now defunct national competitors and mom and pop type stores alike  im not quite sure whether im in a cafe at a newspaper stand a book store a cd shop a movie house or a flea market sometimes  with all the tables and shelves that  you have to dodge its a bit hard to figure it out  feels like the place should implode on itself and then reform into an audio book about coffeei dont know about yall but id rather buy my books from a place that has more knowledge about the merchandise they are selling than a national chain like this|i have to agree with matthew u on this one i do enjoy barnes  nobles but sometimes i get lost just trying to find a darn calendar i went here after a dinner date with some neighbors and couldnt believe how packed it was we had to wait  minutes just to find enough chairs to seat  people we ended up stealing them from other tables not to mention my hubby stood in line for  minutes just to get an ice tea lemonadeso amidst all the books newspapers and magazines they have an audio and video section the prices arent anything to rave about i can buy the same movies online for a lot cheaper theres just the waiting period i do shop here sometimes for there discount books i found a lot of great recipe and mystery books for really cheap like under  thats a pretty good deal but considering there is a half priced book store who has a great selection of books for literally half the price of retailers how can you beat those prices bn is more of a hangout spot with books in case you want to buy one right there and then but everything is kind of confusing you always need to ask where something is id rather shop online for anything i really want its just not worth it to buy it wholesale|this bookstore is absolutely packed full of stuff they have lots of books a display of nooks dvds and cds miscellaneous items like notebooks and calendars and a cafe though a large assortment is nice i feel like the space is very cramped i have purchased a couple books from here  which were pretty easy to find  and have purchased food items from the cafe the cafe is not very impressive ive been pretty underwhelmed by all the food items that ive purchased here i got a slice of quiche here last night when i only had  minutes before a hair appointment at ulta across the street not only did they take  minutes to microwave it but it also came out smelling burnt and burning hot a little band was singing and playing a variety of instruments while i was here i wasnt very impressed until i realized that they were high school kids i thought it as really nice that barnes  noble would let them perform in the store and a great way for bn to get a lot of their family members in the store too|are bn not allowed to have lounge areas anymore i used to love studying and doing work in their comfy chairs and sit there allllll day but i feel like within the last  years or so i havent been in a single bn that had such areas anymore i love books and have always felt that bn can give you a good deal but im not a fan of this particular location because its not that big although it is pretty cleanthe starbucks area they have is okay the starbucks employees in these types of locations are always not the bestbut i dont go there for the coffee obviously i do find it annoying that they dont take starbucks giftcards though  i believe they take bn giftcards and you can also apply your bn membership discountalso their bathrooms are pretty atrocious if you can hold it i would advise you to hold itparking the location is within a shopping areaso i wouldnt say it has its own private lot per se but its an open lot and not actual street parking|it seems every time we go to waterfront we end up coming here every time i like the store but it seems rather daunting in that its so huge  pretty much every time we come here if we havent already hit up the starbucks in the middle of the walkable part of the waterfront where many of the retail stores are well go to this one which isnt that far awaytheres much more seating at this starbucks than the one in the middle as well as it just feels less cramped  the store hasnt changed much most of the special and clearance stuff is at the front while the alternative entrance at the back is where all the music and movies are  the store is pretty organized though by type whether its childrens fiction magazines games and toys etc theres pretty much something for everybody  the nook section is pretty much right when you walk in through the main entrance  i do like this store however i wonder how long it will exist with everything like amazon and ereaders changing how people get their material these days|one of my favorite places to go in pittsburgh with friends good place to chill eat drink and watch the game and maybe some pool afterwards the food is not bad they have pretty good deals for those who are on a budget dollar burger night where you build your own burger is fun but the patties can be dry sometimes so remember to get them sauced iceberg wedge salad is a good salad to have the wings arent as good as you would like i had tried the spicy killer ones and didnt even have to drink water but overall its a nice place to go because its cleaner than most bars you will go and it serves better food than other places as well|nice venue  good food great beer awful service  staying at the sheraton here ive patronized bar louie a dozen times recently and they screw up the order in some fashion every single time without exception|i stopped here yesterday with rob and matt after golf to have a few drinks prior to seeing the hangover at loews across the street  incidentally the hangover is one of the funniest movies ive seen in years and worth the  to see it in the theater  okay back to the restaurant the space itself is very nice  there are plenty of hightops plasmas and a few booths  its spacious and they have outdoor seating and open windows  we sat at the bar and were greeted relatively quickly by the bartender who was tending a pretty much empty bar  i ordered a guinness as usual rob ordered a long island iced tea and matt had a miller light  make sure and tell them if you want a top shelf tea else youll be getting the stuff in the plastic bottles  i sampled robs long island tea and it was not that good way too much sours  the next one he ordered was much better after a little guidance to the bartender  the bartender herself was okay not too friendly but quick enough with the pours  i dont remember her name which is usually not a good sign  we ordered a few things from the appetizer menu  we started with the chips and salsa  the chips were crisp enough but not served warm and the salsa had some spice but the colors were a little off kind of looked like the color of pea soup  rob then ordered the philly cheese steak sliders  i tried one it was okay i guess  the bun was warm and it was pretty loaded with cheese and onions  he asked for a side of mayo and they said they were out which is bizarre because there is a giant eagle a couple blocks away  this pretty much sums up my experiences at the bar louies ive been too  they kind of do just enough for me to come back but rarely make any real effort with service  maybe im being too critical i tried to order the baked goat cheese but they were out so i settled on the hummus appetizer  this was surprisingly pretty good  the pita was warm and toasted the hummus had lots of flavor and the tabouleh was edible  its probably best to stick to simple stuff when dining here  matt had the hot wings which i tried one and it was okay your pretty standard mass produced chicken wing  all in all this place isnt that bad  if you want to grab a drink before or after the movie and youre more concerned with convenience than necessarily friendly service and really good food than you could do worse|an absolute must if youre going to a movie and want a drink  drafts and  special martinis and some halfoff apps on a weekday from  to  however we were bothered that none of the special martinis actually resembled a real martini no gin or vermouth was used its mostly purees and champagne floats with flavored vodkasanyway the small plates made for good upscale bar food halfprice apps make for a cheap but nice dinner and a movie  great great specials however i would not buy a fullpriced dinner here nothing aside from the apps grabbed me for the outstanding price the baked goat cheese was small but delicious and the tempura fried shrimp was just right but the sauces didnt match up exactlybe warned that the seats make you feel like youre going to be swallowed by them seriously the booth was like sitting in the mouth of a whale|the pros great view of the city and river in good weather  lovely for loud large groupsvaried menu with some original itemsgreat place to watch a game inside with a huge barfun locationgood place to take out of townersthe cons the food when i went yesterday was not great  we got the wrong sandwich our order wasnt as described because the kitchen was out of lots of things  tell us when we order not when you deliver the meal without elements on the plate  can be loudnot a place for a romantic datethe bathroom condition was really badthe server did comp up an appetizer and they were friendly enough they just failed to wow the view was great and we did enjoy walking around seeing the fountain dance to pour some sugar on me  seriously  yes   classy eh|went there on saturday night following a movie at loews  we sat at the bar and watched the olympics on their  multiple large flatscreen tvs   ordered the calamari and shrimp quesadillas   the calamari was crisp and plentiful the quesadilla however missed the mark   it wasnt crispy and it tasty sauscy instead of gooey   the menu is large and reminds me of epcot with all the different ethnicities represented   gordan ramsey would probably comment on the lack of focus at first sight   miller lites are  a pop which was a big downer as i got my  bill for two apps and multiple miller lites  great atmosphere and probably a fine place to watch the pens gamefood looks like its hit or missall in all would rather drive down the road to the south side for a post movie food grub and tottie|service has always been good and the food consistent we usually come for happy hour when apps are half off and theres some great deals on drinks as wellthings that stand out to me veggie wrap fried zucchini hummus tabuleh and tzatziki platter and house salad with ranch their ranch is so good i could eat it with a spoon|i had the exact same experience as john r went here to get a quick bite to eat before seeing a movie across the street the place was near empty and there were three waitresses got seated and waited on immediately ordered drinks and it took them  minutes to comeno not alcoholic drinks two waters and an iced tea this should have been a bad sign but at this point we ordered food minutes go bywe flag down our waitress to let her know that we need to get to a movie in  minutes she said our food would be out in a few minutes another  minutes still no food and our waitress is nowhere to be seen we flag down another waitress she says she will find our waitress who we then notice is chatting with one of the other waitresses she finishes her conversation and finally makes her way over to our table about five minutes later she says she didnt even realize our food hadnt arrived well you never even checked on us so of course you didnt after speaking with the kitchen staff she informs us that she definitely put our order in so it must have been given to someone else by mistake because they wouldnt have noticed that that wasnt what they ordered seriouslythe waitress told us she could give us our food for take out and since we were starving we reluctantly agreed  minutes later our food and the bill arrived all that was comped was the iced tea and we got some free utensils and wetnaps how generous we shovelled what we could into our mouths did not leave a tip thankfully we didnt have the added gratuity that john had and sprinted to our movie where we covertly finished our smuggled food worst part i opened the wetnap and it was totally dry of coursehowever i gave this place two stars instead of one thats because my food when i finally got it was perfect i had the greek burger and it was huge cooked exactly how i like it with delicious toppings i really wish i could come back here for the food buthell no|let me just say that this used to be a place i lovedremember when youd go somewhere and have good food great service and a general pleasant experience and then a few months youd go back and have it all again well one day you decide to go back and you realized everything has changed in a way that you cant describe and the place is no longer familiar to me that is bar louiei cant say the food is bad i had an order of the pretzel sticks for an appetizer and the cinnamon sauce tasted like water and the pretzels were stale i will say i still ate them so shame on me my  sandwich the mario as always was very goodnow here comes the bad there were fruit flies everywhere i felt like we were eating on top of a garbage dump at one point i had to get a new drink because one flew in my beer i understand that the establishment is an indooroutdoor place but there is no reason for  fruit flies to hover over my table the place is enormous and they had one very nice but over worked server the girl looked like she was about to have a heart attack because she never stopped moving because of number two our service in general was not good i cant totally blame the girl she did the best we could i mean ive played diner dash on my ipad i know what happens when a place fills up too quickly when you are the only one workingits sad when a place you love turns into a place you never want to go again i think im being very generous by giving it two stars but because i used to love it so much i cant rate it that low part of me hopes it gets better but like an absentee father itll just let me down again|food was ok waitress was a huge air head waited  min for my  beer only got it after i reminded her it is just another disappointing chain restaurant disguised as a local commodity|although i wouldnt  travel out of my way to have dinner here this is a resturant that i enjoy having a meal at when i am in the homestead water front on all of my visits here i have enjoyed the tempura shrimp the dipping sauce are to die for  ive found myself craveing the tempura shrimp and the accompanying sauces the first time i ever had dinner here was as a birthday dinner with me and my big sister so this resturant has sentimental value to me i attach eating here to having a special night out in the waterfront bar louie has some very flavorful and fun dishes for bar food that is|it was the first time that i went to this location  we sat outside and it was a beautiful night  i had the bbq burger with fries  for the price of the burger i expected something much better  it was a very thin burger when it came to the meat  as a whole it looked large but that was only because of what they piled on top of it  in addition their drinks are expensive  just one cocktail could run between  and they arent very large  our waitress spent more time talking to her friends at the next table than actually tending to our needs  there are enough restaurants at the waterfront that i dont know that i will come back here|i personally enjoyed my recent visit to bar louie with a friend but completely understand the poor reviews on help the restaurant is pricey for what it is and our waitress was a bit lacklusterso why does bar louie get  stars happy hour and a nice patiohappy hour is on mondayfriday from pm and offers lots of different options   drafts  wines  martinis and  price select appetizers and flatbreads my friend and i ordered  martinis and  appetizers between the  of us and our bill was less than  total not badi ordered a strawberry peach bellini and a smores martini and both were tasty we shared bruschetta pomodoro spinach  artichoke dip and roasted vegetable flatbread the food was also good and i would order all three items again in the futuremy recommendation is to understand what bar louie is good at happy hour and only frequent the restaurant at those times|this is one of those places where the presentation is nice but the taste is too ordinary friends and i went here for happy hour starting at pm they claimed to have  draft  mixed drinks and half off appetizers when we got there we realized the happy hour special only applies to certain items so pretty much the discount was pointless we ended up spending a fortune on beer and mediocre appetizers i only had appetizers here so i cant really judge them for their entres but i will rate according to my eatingdrinking experience  i got the spinach artichoke dip it was a little runny and the dip to chips ratio was disappointing for a dip it had way too many obstacles built in to it i dont know what they did with the artichoke but it was super fibrousi felt like i was chewing grass overall i would not recommend this place unless you have money to make it rain food was way too average for the high price|this place was pretty good food but the service however was just horrible as a friend said they hire for looks not work ethic plus the fact that it took forty minutes just to get a couple appetizers was ridiculous our server seemed more interested in the table full of girls than actually waiting on us the couple behind us came in the same time and wasnt even attended too until after our appetizers were being cleared off the food was pretty good but because of the service i wont be returning|as far as chain restaurants go bar louie is ok i really like their appetizers and their salads but i dont care for their burgers or pastas their drinks are ok theyre normal corporate restaurant drinksie applebeesservice is hit or miss last time i went i had just fine service the time before that was also just fine sometimes the server is a little spazzy and seems new or doesnt know wtf hes talking about once i went and ordered red zinfandel and he brought me white zinfandel and argued with me that it was red zinfandel i had to explain to him that white zinfandel can be confusing because it is in fact pink i still dont think he believed me it wouldve been amusing if it werent for the fact that it was actually annoying things i like calamari pretzel sticks wedge salad some of the sandwiches things i dislike frozen burgers they sell for great to stop in right before a movie at loews though |i am normally a bar louie fan  my husband and i love the one in tampa  this location needs a lot of work  we went on a friday evening before a show at the improv  we were looking to meet up with friends and have drinks and a quick bite to eat  we never got to the food part because of the level of service that we received  we got there at about  so happy hour was wrapping up but i would say that the bar was not even  full  there were also plenty of empty tables  this should have been our sign to run in the opposite direction  but we grabbed a table  i am not a clock watcher so i am not sure how long it took us to get a server but it was at least  minutes  then we got our drinks at   the only reason that i know is because i was looking at my phone because my husband and i wanted to get some apps ordered before the end of happy hour  that went out the window  when our friends for there they ordered drinks  we finished them and left  the server was nice that is not the issue  the issue was how grossly understaffed they were  they had two bartenders on i think and not nearly enough cocktail servers  the server apologized for the wait on the drinks but explained it away with this happens at the end of happy hour because the bar get swamped  that is a sign that you need more staff  i have never had this happen at any other bar before  get more staff  we ended up passing up on food because we were worried about time not the fact that we did not get hh pricing  even though in my opinion they should have honored hh pricing since we were ready to order food at   we ended up going to the improv and got food there  bar louie lost a great deal of my money because their lack of staffing and they will never get our pittsburgh business again or our friends who live there|the food was okay the noise levelwith  people in a huge roomdeafening awful acoustics|eh this place was okay but it was sort of a weird crowdoverall experience for a saturday nightbobby and i came here after dinner and sat up at the bar tip if you sit behind the taps no one will bother to acknowledge you exist when we moved seats we were finally asked what we would like to drink after waiting for  minutes in our original seats it wasnt all that busy either most of the people sitting at the bar were a bit older than we were it seems that bar louie is trying too hard to be trendy with the decorneon blue lightingextensive martini list maybe im just salty about the wait|i dont frequent bar louie and i really dont plan to change that any time soon ive eaten here and stopped in for drinks a couple times over the years and i just havent been super impressed by the placethe food has been decent  a few years back i splurged on an enormous fried chicken sandwich and definitely enjoyed it glutton that i am  but their meals and appetizers alike have admittedly never wowed me and while i enjoy their cocktails and would consider stopping in just for drinks more often the problem is that things are way overpriced here even during the happy hour drinks are pretty costly not to mention that i think most of the drinks i personally like dont qualify for the happy hour discount which is disappointing once i stopped in with friends after a movie and one drink cost me  here not even a large one either sorry but i find that to be kind of ridiculous especially since theres cheaper places to get drinks in the areastill the food and drinks are definitely aok albeit overpriced so this place would be rated  stars in my mind if i could hear myself think when i eat here but good lord theyre just so loud i always leave with a sore throat from yelling to make myself heard not cool bar louie not coolso while the food and drinks are fine enough the loud venue and prices mean that this is definitely not one of my favorite places  and given the other options we have at the waterfront i dont expect to be back in any time soon|my sons a and i came for tuesday dollar burger night you can gat a burger beef chicken portabella or turkey in a bun with lettuce for a buck then you can add toppings to complete your burger at a small costcheese  cents veggies  cents artery cloggers  cents sauce  cents those are the headings and they have items listed under themlike  different cheeses you can also get a basket of tots or fries for a small price as well my burger was  after i added toppings is it the best burger ive ever had no but is it the best  burger ive ever had  yes its kind if a russian roulette as to how your burger will come to you cooked mine was well done and one if my sons burger had pink in the middle we probably could have sent it back but we dont mind a little pink i love the tater tots  they are crispy and have the right amount of salt yummyour server was great and well definitely be back|great environment at night songs going on very lively the food of my friends who ordered burger and fried shrimps was not that great but i ordered chicken flatbread which was really delicious absolutely loved it  will definitely go here again just for the flatbreads|i went this evening the chop chop salad was awesome the shrimp tempora was too bready the bartenders were awful|food was  out of  for this type of bar  restaurant service was extremely poor and bar service was also extremely poor untrained and understaffed bartenders will keep me from coming back no reason to not be able to get a drink when sitting at the bar|i wanna love bar louie i do it seems like even on the deadest of nights it takes  minutes or more for a waitress to even show up at our table and get a drink order from us the food is good but the past  or  times ive come theyve been out of tater tots by  pm and im always told after my order is put in and the kitchen decides its now time to tell the wait staff theyre out of something it may be time to start frequenting a different location besides the one on the waterfront|good drink new old fashionedfood was so so shrimp tempura app but service was not good and i think it may have been amateur night in the kitchen food took a long time to arrive for a simple fried appetizer  approx  mins with zero acknowledgment from my bartender  shrimp were cooked well but sauces were extremely salty  sweet to be paired with tempura batter  the bar is drafty and customers other than me were complaining with no noticeable change im not staying for a main course|i absolutely love the ambiance of this place the bar area is very large and there is even some upstairs seating with nice couches and whatnot a solid beer selection at reasonable prices makes you want to come back it doesnt generally get very crowded even on friday and saturday nights so dont expect a south side type of environment all that being said there is a reason why this is a twostar review even though this place doesnt get crowded it takes a very long time to get served i have waited up to  minutes between rounds while sitting at a relatively empty bar|i only go here when i cant get into burgatory and because i enjoy the outdoor area with the firepit which is a pretty cool atmosphere  their really unhealthy food options like the loaded fries or loaded tots are pretty good but their healthier food options are really lacking  i tried to get the blackened fish tacos and the fish was really dry and overcooked and of poor quality  the tortillas were completely stale and hard and had large gashes down the middle  they have a decent beer selection but when i asked what their seasonal great lakes on tap was they said the christmas ale its the last week in april now i knew that if i ordered that draft it would be quite stale as its probably been in there for  months now so i got a southern tier instead which was good  the service is ok but rather slow  overall im pretty underwhelmed by this place|really the only thing good about this place is the happy hour no one wants to pay  for a glass of wine that is a short pour and bottom quality|came here for happy hour and a bite to eat on a friday evening  they have some great happy hour deals   drafts with a nice selection and half off flat bread pizza i believe there are three or four different types of the flat bread to choose from  my friend and i sat at the bar and i have to say the service was just ok  we werent given plates or silverware with our pizza the servers didnt seem to know what the other was doing and it was a bit haphazard  i ordered a burger medium rare that came out so rare i could have milked the cow  however the tatertots served with it were deliciouslocated at the waterfront across from the movie theater bar louie offers both indoor and outdoor seating and is a decent option if you dont want to wait around at the other restaurants burgatory is directly across from it  this will not be a go to destination for me but it is a decent happy hour choice|ive had a pretty wide variety of experiences at bar louie  sometimes i go and the service is decent and the drinks are good and sometimes i go and the service is really slow and the drinks are flat or just plain bad  the one thing that is usually pretty consistent though is the food  any food that i have ordered has always been pretty good  ive never had an amazing experience here but i do still go back for food and drink specials and because of its location near the movie theater|my boyfriend and i came for  burger night and the food was delicious i am not a huge bread fan i usually eat my sandwiches open faced but i loved the buns my boyfriend ordered a chicken and a burger  and got both chicken that wouldnt be a big deal if the service made up for mistakes we love the atmosphere and taste of food but the service is horrible this review is not based on a one night experience out of three different times we have experienced bad service very inattentive managers need to review the importance of service with their staff  if some one likes you and you are attentive to their needs they are less likely to complain bit when you are ignored and they make mistakes most make it a point to bring it to a managers attention|its fun but not as fun as kennywood the boardwalk food is a bit too far from the wave pool and that makes for a lot of shoes onshoes off events the lazy river could be much better i did like the water slides and the potato patch fries as well as the scenic location|the evites are in the mail for the  for  special you will have to spend  on a parking pass i signed up last year for this promotion and dont think i got the passes worth the waterpark is nice and lounging by the pool or floating around the lazy river is perfect for a hot summer day there are just too many misses in my book thoughst off all traffic is a biatch be ready to sit on browns hill rd for a very long time unless you leave before am and wait for the park to open at am next remember it is a family park so there will be lots of rude and bratty kids all over the place im not a mean kid hater my experiences have been bad at the sandbar pool if you do arrive early enough you will be standing in the hot sun with a gang of kids that will push you out of the way and run to claim  chairs with towels even though they wont use them because they run around the park all day i actually got into an argument last summer with one said kid i was like im an adult and you need to have some respect he pushed me and took all the chairs i only needed one and his mother did not correct him i was on fire and moved a chair over from the back and he still was giving me crap because i moved the chairs overthat no one was even there to sit in at the time damn for realsandbar drinks are expensive and incredibly weak plus they are so sugary if you do get a frozen drink and sit by the pool be prepared for it to be half pool water in a few minutes an adult area would change all this i dont even care that im getting splashed all the time i do realize that im at a pool but its hard to relaxif you do get a pass have a friend who can get there the same days you can go if youre trying to go on the weekend forget it the weekdays are bad enough im looking for a better pool side lounge for this summer|sandcastle is a mixed bag for the kiddos  on the one hand there are plenty of waterslidespools that are a good fit for young riders on the other hand sandcastle like any city amusement park attracts more than its fair share of highschool kids looking to spend some time away from their parents and assert their personhood  unfortunately that element doesnt particularly care about censoring speech for  year old ears and worse in the mon tsunami about personal space since the wave pool becomes a near mosh pit of jostling and strutting and shoving and showing off for the fairer sex and that can be a little dicey for the littler kidshaving said that its still a good day at the park   cheese fries a cool dip in the pool on a hot day some fun slides   i think in rating sandcastle fairly you have to understand the context of the park  it is not policed particularly effectively  if you take small children you have to be a diligent parent and be aware of your surroundings paying attention to the group of  somethings thrashing around in your near vicinity accidentally bumping into people for a reaction from their group  mostly its a good time  mostly|were lucky to have a waterpark in the burgh  i have to keep telling myself that when i want to complain about this place  i do think its a great place to take the fam or even in my case spend a day relaxing if you can  lets do the compliment sandwich  positive  negative  positive  the negative i feel like sandcastle is the forgotten redheaded stepchild of kennywood  they keep pouring money into kwood but sandcastle stays the same year after year  now granted i havent been there in years but everything seemed the same as i left it other than one new slide  i havent been there in about  years  one new slide in  years  hmmmmmi see major places to improve  especially the pool  i honestly think the slides are great although you could always add more theyre still fun  the pool its just packed  so packed that youd think theyd add a second pool  looking around it looks like they have the extra space  maybe an adults only pool  swimming with  zillion kids plus adults drinking yes i like that you can bring your bevvie in the pool but its kinda weird being around so many kids and you start to wonder how clean the water is  i mean  zillion kids you gotta expect a good amount of kiddos are peeing in the pool  the sidewalks are also scalding hot  id assume since many of the people are walking around barefoot youd be able to custom order some kind of non sun absorbing surface  and im not investing in those dorky water shoes sorry  im always happy to see a potato patch stand  just as good as kwood  they also serve chicken tender which is nice if you want a little meat to add on  nothing more is needed for me  although the frozen drinks looked tasty and tempting it was so hot out i was just downing water by the gallons  youre also allowed to bring in your own snacks and food which i think is nice for families who want to save a little mola  again sandcastle is so awesome to have in the burgh it would be nice to see improvements  it always seems packed in the summer months so why not keep on improving it  or maybe they think dont fix whats not broken  i just may stick to a cleaner less pee filled community pool for my water fun fix|i have the season pass and go atleast once a week and each time ive been in the last week ive beendisappointed two weeks ago they threw a rubber baby in the wave pool and entice panic and claimed iy was a training exercise disgusted and today twice the pool with mushroom and waterfall in it was shut down due to adults pooping in the pool or puking dont know cant get a strait answer from any of employees just sad there customer service sucks|okay so its not as fun as kennywood but i guess its still cool i planned ahead a day to go for me  bobby his first time it was supposed to be nice day but the weather changed in  weeks we picked a nice time since it was literally supposed to rain all day there werent any long lines we literally rode every water slide in one hour then we went to head to the lazy river  it was closed they said it was closed due to not enough attendence but i mean come on we still paid  for  people to come in this park where i just rode everything in one hour keep the lazy river open so i can kill an hour aah the cliff hanger was also closed like always so we just went and rode everything again the dragons den is sweet and the blue tubaluba is as well bobby had a blast on the speed slides i have to admit though i do miss the regular body slide another reason i chose august rd to go to sandcastle was that the park was open until pm rather than  or  like regular days well actually at  we recieved a  minute warning that the park was closing at  due to rain ugh a little more time wouldve been helpful i couldnt hear the warning and asked an employee who said they were closing in ten minutes due to the weather and being understaffed to stay open until  it started to rain at  and literally at  the rain was over  the park couldve just shut down the rides until the rain cloud passed  but due to being understaffed would rather hand out rain checks which is fine because we get an another entire day but i mean it would be a terrible inconvience from someone out of town who planned a family day overall the smile on my boyfriends face was priceless but i truly wish we couldve enjoyed the lazy river and the park until  hopefully next time things go as planned|this was my first time back in about  years  i havent been here since high school so its hard for me to compare  years ago to now  i do know the prices have gone up but i can remember paying   i think the best thing you can do is purchase the tickets at giant eagle or even looking on the sandcastle website for deals  my sister for a deal for  and day in the  season  i  paid  at my local giant eagle  thats not really a big deal  i am definetly shocked that there was a  or  fee to park i mean its ridiculous we have to pay what we pay to get in and another fee to park is crazy  we opted for the  fee to park real close to the entrance bc of having a  year old with us  it is worth that extra   i learned that you should get there and line up at the game fairly early if you want a good spot by the pool people with plow you over and run to get a prime spot  that is a downfall  plus this means that there are a lot of rude people  we got there early enough to ride all the rides we needed too  we didnt do the lay river however because the lines were ridiculous  the wave pool was a hit for my son but just watch all the people there  people are rude there as well  some horse play and such i must comment on the food i def love potato patch fries but the prices are crazy i ordered  chicken tender meals with fries and the costed me around  with drinks  thats is bs  sandcastle is an ok place to visit but its just not worth the money|not bad for neighborhood corner chinese food the szechwan is not good too muchketchup the wonton soup is good  very good curry chicken with onion and happy family egg rolls are hit or miss sometimes they can be a little underdone is this the best place nobut it does the trick especially for a hangover cure|fried rice super blandchicken was slimyservice was indifferent no repeat visit for me|so i moved to pittsburgh from los angeles i know i know i knowanyway so theres absolutely no places in homestead that delivered chinese so i decided to walk down to the closest chinese foodrestaurant to my house the family that runs the restaurant is very friendly i read a review about them on google that said the  mom looks like she might want to cook you alive dont believe iton this visit i ordered the steamed dumplingsrecommended by some reviewer on googlethat liar and the vegetable chow fun i generally enjoy steamed dumplings but these dumplingstoo much dumpling little meat werent so good theyll probably be sitting in my mini fridge tomorrow and ill force myself to eat them when i have the munchiesstarving to death the vegetable chow fun on the other hand verrrrrrrrrrrrrry yummy definately most have next time anyone decides to stop by but all in all the verdict is you typical chinese take out placeputs the menu on the fridge|meh ive experienced better is an understatementfridays is like the fine dining chain for every yinzer in pittsburgh  when we were seated it was quick which was a surprise  somehow this restaurant gets packed and i never understand why  i was happy about that  i ordered one of their skinny margaritas blackberry to be exact  it was a nice size however at pop that was half of my food bill  the waitress started off attentive but after our food came out she was gone  i ordered a turkey burger with pickle and mustard  loaded mashed potato on the side because i wanted heartburn ha  food came  my burger had lettuce on it only  waitress was supposed to go and get our next round of drinks  i had to wait to ask for my pickle  the loaded potatoes were more like rubber than potatoes and not what i was expecting  disappointment  the waitress then went into oblivion and only returned with our check  never again will i eat at fridays  i will however go should a happy hour arise|this place is ok if ur grabn something quick  but they do have a great happy hour tho|if i were to describe this place in one sentence i would call it a mediocre and cheaper version of bettis  on the north shoremy wife and i won a gift card in a raffle  we went for lunch on a saturday it was not crowdedwe entered the restaurant and were promptly seated by a nice server  the restaurant was clean and nicely decorated and did not feel run down or old in any wayour server took our drink order and returned promptly  we got the pretzels with beer cheese appetizer and we each got a hamburgerour food arrived promptly and the appetizer was fine   years ago i would have called it good or better but time has marched on and expectations are higher then they once werethe same goes for the main course the fries were unremarkable but decent as were both burgers  the bill was also fair  the meal with two drinks and an appetizer was reasonable for what we got the server was pleasant and attentive all in all this fridays as a good but likely quickly forgotten experiencei would return here for lunch like i did today|im not opposed to chain restaurants but this tgi fridays in comparison to some of the other ones in the area truly falls short of the chain expectation i order the jack daniels chicken and shrimp with just fries the fries were undercooked and thrown haphazardly into the sauce holder the shrimp was over cooked and just deepfried the chicken was fatty and just tasted like it came from their freezer even the water tasted weirdfortunately we had a very nice and charismatic waiter and all of the staff was very friendly id recommend the tgi fridays out in south hills village over this one any day|i had a gift card so i decided to use it for a to go order the food tasted frozen and microwaved nothing special just around average|went with  others for a weeknight dinner the server was very friendly but seemed a little overwhelmed maybe they were short handed  the food was to me not even average i ordered a burger which very overdone and dry had to drown it in mayo to get moisture in it  my friend ordered nachos and what arrived looked like they had broken some taco shells down the middle then put cheese and one jalapeo slice on each piece imagine  halfmoons of taco shell  not like any nachos ive ever seen and more importantly not even the way they were served the three prior times my friend had ordered them|i understand its a chain and pretty standardized everywhere you go but i found this location to be especially bad first when you walk in the restaurant has a very stale grease smell that permeates throughout the restaurant nothing visibly dirty but smells like the entire joint needs degreased second the service the host was a typical younger girl efficient without too much professionalism not a big deal the waitress a professional  but unfortunately not in the way of experienced great service but moreso as experienced in efficiently moving things along  our food took a long time and she saved herself by telling us that she didnt know why our food wasnt ready yet but would check again and of course hot plates with lukewarm food came out soon after she reeked of cigarette smoke so im going to make a dumb assumption and guess thats where she was  the food typical tgifridays food good enough for a chain restaurant  extremely unlikely that id return|fridays seems to have gone down hill i was quite surprised when we went and there want a wait i thought we had lucked out we were seated quickly and our server came over quickly there was only one other table that had people in the section we were in i ordered a jack daniels burgercooked medium our food came quickly my burger was well done and dry without the jack daniels sauce there was no flavor at all  the fries were pretty goodi was sad to see how far down the quality of food had gone  thankfully our server did a nice job|a tgi fridays is a tgi fridays you either like it or hate it this location is pretty standard it has the expected mashup of decorations around the walls that try to give the place a laidback lounge feel and theres nothing outstanding about the menu or what they offer food wise and like other fridays its not particularly easy to eat here if youre anything other than a meat loverhonestly i wasnt expecting to eat here any time soon i had called a few days before eating here while planning a day out with friends and asked about reservations for a large group as it says on the tgi fridays website that its ideal to call ahead when you have a large party however i was told on the phone that this location does not accept reservations so my friends and i looked elsewhere and finally walked across the street to fridays after discovering just how darn long the waits at other restaurants were at least fridays only had a  minute waitonce we were seated our meal went by pretty uneventfully i remember that we had to repeat ourselves a lot to our waitress and i had wondered why she was having trouble hearing us but at least she was willing to ask questions and clarify things as opposed to taking a potentially wrong order back to the kitchen kudos the food as i mentioned earlier was standard tgifridays nothing particularly wrong with it just not that exciting either i had actually found one of the only lowcalorie items on the menu at the last minute  a steak and vegetable dish  and standard or not i was honestly pretty happy with it my steak was surprisingly juicy came out fairly pink and was not overcooked at all id ordered a medium temperature steak and the simple and tasty vegetables offered a nice alternative to some of the other excessive dishes i saw on the menu not that that mattered after i ordered a rum punch cocktail which mixed so much rum fruit juice sprite and other sugary beverages together that my teeth probably rotted a little bit in my head it was worth it though  that drink was a sweet tall cup of heaventhis tgifridays really fits my exact definition of an aok place  its not terrible nor is it not exceptional its just a decent place to grab a bite or to enjoy a drink id consider coming back again but admit that they wouldnt be my first choice so much as a solid backup plan for when other waterfront eateries are super busy|this place is kind of a hybrid of applebees and cpk which isnt to say its bad but nothing to rave about either i got their slider meal which was tiny for me and my friend got their steak which was way tiny the food was fine and the service was okay but really felt like an applebees knockoff and applebees isnt even worth knockingoffing anyway  stars|service was very slow from the beginning it took a while for us to get our water i ordered a blue raspberry slushie which also took awhile to be served it tasted okay but the mango peach slushie was way better you can change flavours we got the all you can eat appetizers for  but now you can only get refills on the same appetizer you ordered whereas in the past you could change the appetizers you orderedso we got loaded potato skins which was delicious the skin was crispy and the potato was soft and the cheese was so good the bacon bits were crispy we trie jack daniels and barbecue boneless wings the jack daniels were my favourite they were sweet and crispy the potstickers were very hot when they were first served and after awhile the skin of the potsticker was just really floury and chewy|i dont care what cub and bulls fans think this steeler and penguins fan thinks deep dish pizza is not all that first the crust tastes like a biscuit and biscuits belong nowhere near or on a pizza i will give unos a thumbs up on its flatbread its better pizza than some pizzerias in the area when i look over unos menu almost nothing excites me this place is a dud guess what chicagoans dont know how to eat hot dogs either|not quite authentic but good enough for pittsburgh its the only place that ive found that even comes close to a classic chicago style deep dishi also had the french onion soup that wasnt bad the croutons were still crunchy and it had just the right amount of cheesemy girlfriend really enjoyed her caesar salad and said shed come back just for the saladoverall i enjoyed it and would come back the next time i get a craving for a deep dish pizza it wasnt authentic but it certainly was not terrible|i really love deep dish pizza the thick crust that is crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside the spicy peppery sauce that can singe your tongue the mixture of ingredients just sliding down your chin as it bubbles out of your mouth that being said i really dont understand why people go to pizzeria uno this chain has done to the deep dish pizza what mcdonalds has done to hamburgers pizza hut has done to pan pizza dominoes has done to hand tossed pizza and taco bell has done to texmex it has made it almost unpalatable on our menufrench onionchicken bitespizza with pepperoni hamburger and romanolooking past the fact that the service was not the best or the fact that the food came out undercooked and tepid in temperature the food just was not good dont get me wrong this is not the worst pizza i have ever eaten but this chain is a perfect example of what happens when something becomes so prescribed overhandled and overthought that it no longer resembles the original piece of art that tasted so good i really never want to return|i really dont know why i bother with chain restaurants anymore  now that my palate has matured and i no longer think chicken fingers and french fries are gourmet cuisine i really cant find anything to eat in a place like this  my husband and i were running errands at the waterfront and we needed to find a place for lunch  we decided on uno because pizza sounded good to us  my husband is a meat lover so i agreed to let him order us a meatcovered pizza  to counteract this a little i ordered a tomato mozzarella salad so wed at least have some vegetables in the mix  when the salad arrived it did not look like the picture  the menu description is thus chopped lettuce roma tomatoes with basil and garlic buffalo mozzarella drizzled with balsamic syrup  this description is accompanied by a bright colorful picture of a salad with bright green lettuce bright red tomatoes and a delicate drizzling of balsamic syrup  it looks light and yummywhat we got however was soggy yellow and white iceberg lettuce completely drenched in dressing a total of four tiny pieces of tomato and some cheese  it was disgusting  there was so much dressing dripping off of this dish it was more like a soup than a salad  i suspect that the lettuce was so wilted and brown they figured they could disguise it by completely soaking it in dressing  not only was it disgusting but it cost us about    for complete inedible slop  the numero uno pizza we got was nothing to write home about either  it was ok very mediocre  the crust tasted like it was undercooked and the sauce tasted like plain tomato sauce with no seasoning whatsoever  i have been to chicago many times had real chicago deep dish many times and this just doesnt even come close to the real thing  the only positive i give this restaurant is they have the kiosk in the front where you can look up the calorie count of the food right there  it would be better if theyd actually print it on the menu but they are still doing better than most restaurants in this effort  they are making strides too with their whole grain crust options  im sure theres still a lot of room for improvement however  if youre listening uno please work on providing your customers with healthier food  not just healthy options like salads but work on making the main dishes you serve better for your customers lowfat cheese lowsugar sauce less sodium etc   their hearts will applaud you  and lastly why does every chain restaurant have to decorate with old signs  is there some sort of chain restaurant decorating requirement i dont know about  its baffling|food was ok had a steak w shrimp side ass mashed potatoes everything was ok not a lot of flavor|came here on a monday night  boy was the place dead  i was the only only customer at pm  ordered a thin crust pizza with extra cheese pepperoni and mushrooms  it was pretty good  could of used more cheese   i wasnt in the mood for the heavy crusted deep dish pizza this is my first time at this location but have been to several of the other locations in the us  it was just like the others  the caesar salad with anchovies was very good  the service was very poor  my waitress spent a lot of time chitchatting with the hostess  it was a chore to get water refills from her  they have big screen televisions in the bar area which can be seen from the restaurant|pizza ok on its own nothing great  definitely not worth the restaurant price  definitely not like pizzeria uno in chicago are they even related   or are they just using their name and trademark|i ate here at around  on a saturday night  reading the other reviews it makes me wonder if people were a the same restaurant i was  sure it isnt a world class dining establishment but it is decent considering it is a chain  you should know that going into any chain really  it was basically exactly what i expected in terms of food quality and pricewe were greeted immediately upon entering and while the hostess went to grab menus another server asked us if we were taken care of  service at our table was very attentive and water and other beverages were promptly refilled  i ordered soup and two appetizers instead of an entree or pizza and the server made sure to ask me about the order in which i would prefer receiving my food  my fiance ordered a deep dish pizza and we know they take longer to make than other food items  it was quicker than we thought it would be and he really enjoyed it  i had the potato skin appetizer  it reminds me of a baked potato pizza that i used to enjoy at a local place back in buffalo  it was delicious especially with the addition of a little bit of hot sauceoverall it doesnt even come close to visiting an unos in chicago but then again when does a copy every live up to the original  it wont be a regular location in our  dining rotation but it is good to know that when we have a craving for deep dish uno will do the trick and cost a lot less than a trip to chicago|the menu is outstanding but the pizza and beer is too expensive for  personal pizzas the size of pizza hut  beers and  salads we paid over  bucks the personal pizzas alone were  each if you want pizza and beer go somewhere elsepasta appetizers or sandwiches this place is good|well this visit started off good i was seated right away no wait was given a good beer selection of some pa craft beers ordered the traditional deep dish pizza but with no onions now after we ordered it just went downhill from there was never asked if i wanted another beer the waitress just gave me more water my pizza still had onions in it which i stated right off the bat that i didnt blame the girl who took my order i know cooks cant read i was one for many years mistakes happen and the manger took care of it and took the item off my bill no complaints still ate the food and it was good just not a fan of onions on my pizza now onto the bill the server continues to tell me that she was sorry for the mistake and declares she told the cooks not to add onions i already said it was taking care of and theres no worries she goes on to say that the next day was her birthday and if i felt like leaving all my money as a tip it wouldnt go unnoticed i took this as a joke as i had told her earlier i worked in the industry when i hand over the gift card i had on hand she comes back and again repeats herself tells me that cash as a tip is preferred as she doesnt have to claim it at the end of the night and again if i felt like leaving her all my money she would just be so freaking happy let me explain one thing and hopefully i am very clear on it no server and i mean no server anywhere should ever ask a guest or customer for a tip yet alone do it twice so out of kindness which i shouldnt have left anything by this point i left a nice tip for the cost of what food i did  have to pay forbottom line the food was good for the price but the service from this one person as i dont know how the rest of the servers are was just horrible|i think the location in homestead has ruined this place dirty dirty dirtybathrooms unkept entry door handle and windows filthypizza had too much sauce on it and was drenched server was coarse not refinedserving items were old and rusty temperature of food was not hotlow quality but probably ok with pittsburgher s|pizza is a staple for me i love everything about crunch crust a nice rich tomato sauce and a thick layer of melted cheese i have never tried chicago style pizza before and when we had to rescue our friends from car troubles unos was right there so we decided to try it out only a  minute wait for a saturday is pretty good for any restaurant in the waterfront we were seated at a booth in the bar area the tables were clean and it was a big booth so the four of us were not squished only complaint the bar was loud and when they did blended drinks you had to pause your conversation because the blenders were so loud good news only happened twicethe four of us decided to order two pizzas the pepperoni and the farmers market i also ordered a caesar salad because i needed more vegetables in my life  the salad it was a big salad that i shared with my boyfriend the croutons were huge and very crunchy the caesar dressing was not creamy it was vinegar based and had a little bit of a bite to it as chris kept on saying i thought the bite had more to do with the vinegar than anything spicy but who am i to say  the lettuce was fresh and crunchy and they even added tomatoes like i requested the main dishes came out about  minutes later i do not know what i was expecting but the pizzas were not as large as i was imagining two of the larger pizzas looked like personal pizzas to me but i was soon to see that even if they are a bit smaller they were filled to perfection the farmers market pizza had caramelized onions spinach sun dried amazing tomatoes regular tomatoes eggplant pesto as a sauce and a blend of cheeses the crust was perfection being so crisp and light that i stole chris extra from his plate the sun dried tomatoes were great adding just enough sweetness to the pizza that i went looking for the slices with the most on them it was a really really good pizza we even ended up taking slices home with us my eyes deceived me at first with the size then our friends told us that we had to try the cookie pizza cookie pizza what sorcery is this matt the one who suggested it said that we would not be disappointed this cookie came out in a really large bigger than our pizzas dish it had three scoops of icecream on it with a pile of whipped cream warm right out of the oven fresh cookie pizza oh sweet heavens it was good i am glad that i had enough room in my stomach to pile in that sweet goodness chicago pizza i would absolutly try again|was very disappointed with the food it was overcooked and not seasoned very well|nice place but some of the items on the menu are not available unless you get a  for  but thats not what the online menu states and its a salad come on|i am glad that western pennsylvania has one remaining outlet for the great chicagostyle deep dish pizza offered by uno its pioneer  dining here brought back memories of an excellent meal i enjoyed in chicago last month at uno subsidiary pizzeria duethe restaurant is attractive and comfortable and the outdoor seating by the river a delight  the tables outside though are too close and if all are occupied one can hear every word of what is said at neighboring tablesthe spinach and chicken pizza appetizers of zucchini chips and spinach and artichoke dip were all delicious but the zucchini was extremely saltyour server was pleasant and attentive performing many quality checks   is a lot to pay for a pizza but the deep dish pies are hearty and plenty for two people  for a small glass of house wine is excessive  the  tariff for the single serving appetizers was fair for the quality and the portion sizesthe weak link was the young lady who seated us  she was glum unfriendly and without a smile  instead of saying enjoy your meal when seating customers she says there you are  how a customer is greeted can set the tone for a meal and this is an important facet of the front of the house operation at the cheesecake factory the host staff is trained to engage the customer in pleasant conversation while leading the guest to the table the individual at uno got us off to a poor start  a nice touch would be for a manager to provide a quality check and make the diner feel welcome|this was my first time at an unos in about ten years my kids ordered pizza which was just ok  i however was pleasently surprised with what i ordered the bbq firehouse chicken sandwich was absolutely awsome  two big thumbs up for the sandwich  wait staff was friendly and attentive|last week was my first visit to this place the raspberry tea was amazing we got the app sampler  it was very good except for the homemade guacamole i ordered a side salad hardly any dressing on it and not very fresh i ordered the stuffed chicken with broccoli  grilled vegetables  waited along time for the entre  the chicken was good but a small portion  the broccoli  veggies were water logged lots of water on the plate tried my friends fried shrimp it was good with good flavor might have just been who was in the kitchen that night so i would give it another shot|the only reason to come here is because its a fun place to eat it sure isnt the food too much dressing in a salad that didnt even fill the bowl like so many before it unos is making me leave hungry it was a salad with walnuts goat cheese and blueberries and while it was good there was absolutely no value in this meal one of these days i will learn to stop eating at big chain restaurants kind of like not shopping at big box stores its a nice atmosphere and generally crowded and loud some would call it fun and i think it is but sometimes its worth a little extra to get what you really want and need in a meal thats what adds value in the future these places will be relegated to the last ditch effort when nothing else is available only in a pinch|stopped in for lunch on a sunday  small crowed for  on a football day  our server was very friendly  took  trys before i found a beer that they had in stock but we made it  im crazy when it comes to craft beers and trying the selection you have but keep them in stock its not that hard anymore  had the  for   i had the chicago classic and italian salad both out standing salad was very large and pizza was just the right size for a lunch  all in all great place for lunch just buy some beer|met my family here after work on a weekday not many people dining here at the time but our dinners seemed to take longer then they should have considering not very busy as we were waiting on our pizza the waitress handed us a trivia game console to use we played  games of trivia and the game of life the pizza came and the crust was very dry and not much flavor to it when we were presented with our check we noticed a charge of  that we didnt know what it was for  when we asked what the charge was for they charged us for the games that we played on the console that they gave us while waiting for our dinner i have never heard of anything like it i wonder how many people used the games and were charged the fee and paid it without noticing it on the bill considering it was hidden discreetly in the middle of the bill then when we were ready to pay the bill with cash we couldnt get our server to come and take payment was very disappointed it will probably be awhile before i go back if ever|love the stores selection but hate how the girls chase you around to tell you their sales if i wanted to know id ask |if the p stood for philadelphia and the f stood for flyers then pf changs would make more sense because this is the most americanized asian food i have ever tasted  one of the special dishes offered tonight consisted of chicken yukon gold potatoes and some sort of sauce  youkon gold  do you eat those potatoes with rice  my order of singapore noodles had french fried onions on top  with curry powder i assume it was powder because the menu promised curry but there was no sauce     the restaurant is halffull on a thursday night but noisy with at least three decades of american top music blaring nonstop  the bar is large the beer glasses are tall and thin but theres not  a tsing tao or plum wine in sight  this is as us as a place can get     but heres the thing  the french fried onions are crispy and spicy we order a  plate of garlic sugarsnap peas and thats exactly what we get  snap peas stirfried for not more than two minutes in a little oil a lot of garlic and probably a pinch of salt  this is a fresh simple tasty treat and its matched by the broccoli that comes with the broccoli and chicken dish  the sauce is blandly acceptable but the broccoli is emerald green and abundant       i hate the pf chang ritual where they mix their own special sauce for you as though you are incapable of mixing soy and chili paste yourself  worse it seems to imply that the food theyre serving will be so tasteless it will need all the help it can get from this spicy concoction  but once the wait staff departs i just ignore the mess and forget my irritation  because much as i hate to admit it the food although about as asian as the plastic chop sticks they distribute is fresh tasty and wellpresented  the staff remembers to refill the water glasses  id love to give this place two starts but i keep going back so i have to give it three or im a chump  but ill be damned if i call it an asian food restaurantps    i probably must mention that ben roethlisberger was coming in to pf changs just as i was leaving  with a goodlooking woman  does that increase or decrease the stars to be awarded|wasnt terriblebut certainly wasnt greatsave your hardearned cash|stars are for the food only     ratinggot there at pm on saturday night they told us it was an hour wait which was expected but it only took minutes to be seated so that was a bonus  started off with the lettuce wraps and i used to be a fan of these but they just seem to bore me nowfyilove the lettuce wraps at the cheesecake factory  i had the singapore rice noodles  this was so so as i thought immediately that lu lu noodles and asian cafe are better  the fried rice was disappointing and the vegetables tasted raw   some good notes were the dynamite shrimp plump juicy tangy with a small kick    sweet and sour chicken was just the same minus the kick the service was annoying   we were there less than  minutes and it seemed like our waiter was in a rush to get us out of there   constantly asking if he could remove my plate  i had to sternly say at one point that i will let you know when i am finished  i found it rude especially since  there wasnt even a line at this point  i think we will travel elsewhere following a movie  the result never quite met the anticipation|redoi went to pf changs several years ago and was not pleased with the food that was presented to me  my issue i thought i was getting chinese food  my resolution try this restaurant again knowing that it is just reinvented american food with names of those chinese dishes i actually like to eatso we returned to pf changs for lunch to try this american food in this caricature of a chinese restaurant  there were very few people in the restaurant  the two of us were seated in the largest corner booth and left to review our menus  when our waitress finally arrived we ordered the following itemscoca colaiced teapan fried pork dumplingssesame chicken lunch with white rice and egg drop soupchangs chicken with white riceour drinks and my soup came out immediately  unfortunately i was brought the wrong soup and the server had disappeared before i had a chance to say anything  i could see her across the barren wasteland that was the dining room and we even made eye contact several times but at no point could i get her to come back to my table  i tried the soup and was disgusted with it and placed it at the end of the table  i didnt know what it was and didnt want to know  almost ten minutes later she arrived quite happy with the job she was doing and asked how the food was  i asked if she could bring out some egg drop soup i didnt expect to get the stinkeyemy egg drop soup was brought out with the dumplings as well as the caddy of different sauces and oils  the server really wasnt that into the experience but again gave me the stinkeye when i told her that mixing the sauces was unnecessary since i knew what each of them was and would be able to mix them myself  i mixed the rice vinegar chili oil chili paste and soy sauce my guess is that it was supposed to be tamari to create a dipping sauce for our dumplings i took a bite of the soup and it was somewhat better than the other soup but it was still brown  i ate half the bowl and left the rest for the server  it was thick and gooey and the flavor didnt wow  i saw no reason to continue  i moved on to the dumplings which had an okay flavor to them  the skins were a bit thick and doughy  the meat on the inside did not balance this attribute at all  the sauce tasted a little odd so i tried to remix and it was still off  i tried the components individually and found that some of them were either old stale or rancid  we finished our dumplingsour lunch entrees arrived  i had ordered mine extraspicy but i guess it came pittsburgh hot super mild and had a lackluster flavor at best  the meat was tough and the sauce tasted of soy sauce more than anything else  i tried some of changs chicken and was equally mollified  this was supposed to be their version of general tsos chicken  now i have never had a generals chicken that was the same at any place  it is always different  many of them are good in different ways  this food though it wasnt good  changs chicken fell into the same category as the sesame chicken  since it tasted mainly of soy sauce  with the addition sugar  i just dont understand how anyone can like this place  even the yoshida sauce you get at samscostco tastes better|i used to come here a lot about  years ago but then i stopped for one reason or anotheri came back again tonight after the long hiatus and i was disappointed the deep dish personal pepperoni pizza wasnt very good  the sauce tasted bland the crust tasted oily and a bit overcooked or stale and there wasnt much flavor to the cheese i havent been feeling well and thought it might just be me but my husband tried it and said the same thing he also said his chicken parmesan sauce tasted blandi feel bad  it was a little like looking at an old taylor swift album you used to love five years ago except now you realize the songs were sappy and she looked completely different i used to love uno but its not at all what i remembered it to be|went there for lunch and had a decent meal  while the mongolian beef was beyond excellent the moo goo gai pan was average although i did enjoy the shrimp in it  service was fine and decor is pleasant  for some reason im just not in the mood to write a detailed review  please accept my apologies|sadly ive been here a few times because its a crowd pleaser when my girlfriends parents come down to visit theres nothing really wrong with it the portions are big and the food is alright and the interior gives you the superficial impression that youre encountering fine diningthe food is sooooo bland though everything you get at pf changs you can get elsewhere in pittsburgh at a much lower cost and itll be made with more precision and have better flavor the honey chicken at pf changs was so mediocre all i could think about while eating it was heading over to wai wai in bloomfield and getting a tastier order of it for  buckslast time we were there the server was horrendous as well i dont think ive ever felt as awkward at a restaurant he brought my girlfriends father don his unsweetened tea then told him he didnt bring sugar because he asked for it sweetened and then did not understand the concept of sweetening it yourself he then got all huffy when don kept asking for it and actually seemed angry at us when he came back to take our order don ordered for himself and his wife and before janey my girlfriend and i could order he had already started to walk away we actually had to yell out to get him to come back and finish our order not in an uncivilized or malicious way either after that he must have thought we were terrible diners i dont think ive ever been impolite to someone who is currently at work or anyone for that matter and he showed it by being silent and plopping things down in a passive aggressive way it was really embarrassing and every time he came by the conversation diedobviously the attitude of one idiot who cant hide his bad day well doesnt really have anything to do with the restaurant but its soooooo bland go somewhere else for chinese look up chinese on urbanspoon and itll give you a variety of good local places to choose from at half the price|ive had pf changs both in pgh and kc and honestly im never been disappointed nor elated with the food its upscale americhinese food you dont come here seeking authentic asian staples its all changed to some degree to suit american taste buds nothing wrong with that imo do i even know what authentic chinese food is yes sortuv somewhat will i stop putting quotes around everything definitely notit was  min from closing time when we party of  rushed in on a weeknight got seated ordered and ate without feeling rushed by the staffthis particular pf changs on the homestead waterfront had fast and friendly service though he forgot our order of asparagus we sampled everything from the the szechuan shrimp to the mongolian beef to the dan dan noodles good flavors nothing that stepped out in the crowdi dont come here all that often but when i do i invariably leave feeling satisfied and full|love the food try the bomb pop martini the service has definitely gone down hill in the past year and when ive  told the manger he just doesnt give a shit  its either hit or miss with service but food is always good|the service was lackluster coffee was warm but delicious limited to one cup apparently as the waitress never offered a seconddaughter had sweet and sour shrimp wife had spicy chicken i had wonton soup dumplings as an appetizer for the table all arrived warm the brown rice was dry as sand and the white rice was delayed by rice cooker problems also dry as sand i guess that is how they serve itthe base flavors for the shrimp and chicken were nearly identical i had expected them to be more diverse in all expectations were not met for what is advertised as upscale id rather have the local chinese cuisine which more flavorful and much less expensive|first time eating at pf chang thought the food was fine but id rather go to an authentic chinese restaurant any day it felt like a chinese version of the cheesecake factory  anyway it was a saturday late afternoon and despite lots of empty tables we had to wait  minutes to be seated and after that waited  min  for our food  i dont know if they were just short staffed the day we went but i wasnt impressed with the servicesome nice items on the menu include the lettuce wraps and the salt and pepper calamari which comes with a separate dish of salt and pepper for dipping the sesame chicken was also very good  other things were fine just not memorable  i think this is an ok place to eat if you happen to be shopping at the waterfront and dont mind spending a little time over lunch or dinner if you want to get in and out in a hurry dont come here|i was unimpressed with my food and i am even more sad to see now that pf changs mass produces frozen dinners this is about as far away from chinese food you can get unless of course you are eating microwaved warmed shrimp fried rice the restaurant is cluttered and the music was up so loud  i had to yell to carry on a conversation pf changs in the waterfront is a unmemorable experience maybe i would have better luck microwaving my own meal at home|i really enjoyed my mongolian beef and pork pot stickers but there was no presentation of pfc mixing sauces one of the things that sets pfc apart from the run of the mill non franchise is presentation and experience  i was extremely disappointed by the lack of presentation reservationsour party arrived about  minutes before our  reservationsat  we were informed our reserved table had been given to another party  obviously someone dropped the ball herewhen we requested silverware for the table our waitress blamed it on the hostess yes thehostess should have provided silverware however it was unprofessional of our waitress to pass buck as a patron i could care less whos fault it is just in fix it defiantly took away from my pfc experiencemy hot and sour soup is usally served withnoodley things that i drop in the soup we werent given any noodley  things  not trying to be a jerk but all things being equal the pfc isnt selling food as much as they are selling an experience this experience is what sets this restaurant apart|i have mixed feelings about this place i wish i could give  stars but im in a good mood so im rounding up today this was my first time here and i honestly wasnt sure what to expect the first thing i noticed when i walked in was the layout of the dining area it seemed less intimate than i had pictured in my mind the tables were all jammed together and the restaurant had a crowded feel to it fortunately there wasnt a long wait as we had made a reservation we were seated at a table in the middle of the dining room alongside a busy throughway it seemed all the servers were destined to walk past our table i appreciated that their menu pointed out that their meals were meant to be shared my wife and i decided to share our two meals changs spicy chicken and double pan fried noodles before our meal came out our waitress set some sauces on the table in a heres your sauce kind of way i remember thinking thats very nice but i have no idea why you just gave us sauce there was no explanation  just a little tray of sauces our food came out and she finally asked if we like mild medium or hot sauce we picked medium and with a few scoops she turned our three sauces into three mixed sauces and i still didnt know what they were for forget the sauce though my attention was now drawn to our meal for meals that were meant to be shared these sure are little portions i guess when you go for that highend presentation you can charge  more for  less the food itself was good in an ok sort of way i cant say it was the best ive had but it was good enough overall i thought the experience was lacking pf changs tries to be classy but does it in a cafeteria sort of way i was constantly distracted by the front doors opening and icy air pouring across the room the music didnt fit the ambiance our table felt like it was in the middle of the road the restaurant was loud and crowded the girls at the table next to us were taking those annoying duckface puckered lip pictures  i think our experience may have been different if we were seated at one of the booths along the side of the restaurant but no such luck|let me start by saying that i do like their food last night i went with my wife and two guests the apps came out fast and were fantastic dinner on the other hand didnt come out quickly at all the rice was undercooked and we told our server he set the rice on the empty table next to us and forgot to bring a new order by the time i was almost finished with my meal another server came over and they brought back another bowl of crunchy white riceis that the way rice is prepared nowi ordered the chocolate cake i asked for a container to take half home the server brought out a small container and when i asked for a larger one she said we can just squeeze it in there and started to flatten the cake she then realized that a larger one would be better people not crowded hours total|our last few visits have left something to desire one of the things i always notice is the demeanor of an establishments employees these people look miserable no one smiles or greets you appropriately its more like get in get out turn the tablesthe food has remained consistently good when we can order it the last time jb and i came for a quick dinner the place was not busy yet we were passed by  frowning waitstaff without getting drinks for  minutes we were left suiting at our table with our menus closed and sitting on the edge of the table hint hint so we left and most likely will not be returning|if you look at other reviews you will see that i am a very positive person but tonight was an utter disaster  we sat at the bar and the female bartender  was miserable we ordered drinks and she was unhappy that we did  she spent  minutes sending text messages and took  smoke brakes in one hour while our drinks were empty we ordered appetizers and they never came out  she actually brought us our check and we never got our food by the way we were the only people at the bar  finally a bus boy brought us our food after we payed we payed before our food came because we thought our table was ready we finally got seated by the windows do not sit by the windows because it was very cold we ordered our dinner and drinks and guess what no drinks after our food came we asked about our drinks and the waiter said he forgot nothing was comped and no manager was available this pf changs needs new management we will never return i will give it  stars because the food was great but the employees are absolutely miserably from hostess to waiters to bartenders steer clear until changes are made its not worth the headache|came out here with my parents to have dinner  i have to say that our meal was all around worth a  star rating but the lousy attitude of the hostess and the man behind the desk who seemed to be in charge quickly lowered that rating  our food was pretty good  the lettuce wraps are usually my favorite part and this time it was no different  my moms fried fish peices and veggies was also delicious  however my  mahi mahi was pretty much like eating air there was seriously no taste at all and it was tiny  i found myself adding all the extra sauces on the table just to try to give it some dang flavoringif i was you i would order lettuce wraps for an app and lettuce wraps for your meal  if you have room lettuce wraps for dessert too  oh yeah and to drink lettuce wraps|ok so ive eaten here more than once but just thought to write a review on it now ill be honest this is the only one ive ever been to so i dont know if theyre all the same but every time im underwhelmed i get there look at their giant selection and get excited then i get my meal and remember that ive never had anything too great dont get me wrong its not bad but for how much they charge they really need to step it up or at least give me a huge portion just saying|ive heard its very much a chain and that its not at all authentic chinese food however despite all that i have to admit the food was good and the service was excellent  there is quite a disconnect with the loud rock music played in the dining room and the serene chinese decor but i figure it works for somebody  i ordered the ginger chicken with broccoli and the meal was quite tasty  the prices are quite reasonable  just as long as you are not looking for authentic chinese dishes this restaurant will definitely serve in a pinch|i seriously dont know why people love this place so much the food here is horrible the rice is never cooked properly and its not even asian food its fake asian food i never come here anymore|still good food but i find that more times than not when we go we have to ask for clean dishes or silverware i have found this whether we are at the waterfront location or the robinson location maybe they need a new contract with a new appliance company|my wife and i came here a few years ago and you couldnt get in the door because of the line this was the hottest new place on the restaurant scene and everyone wanted to try it fast forward to present day and youd never believe that was ever the case changs is poorly set up as one large open room thats rather noisy food came out quickly but was not as good as the chinese take out we get from sesame inn spicy chicken was neither spicy nor very flavorful and had a massproduced feel to it took half home to eat the next day but ended up throwing it out a few days later normally one of the great thing about getting chinese is looking forward to the leftovers the next day   another minus was noticing how dirty the floor was on the way back to the bathroom i dont expect a place to be immaculate in the middle of dinner service but this looked like the mcdonalds on smithfield downtownthe one bright spot was our waitress was very good and kept our water glasses filled we just came from kennywood so we went through quite a few fill ups during our time there short of this id probably give changs two stars probably last time ill stop in here unless i cant get in to any restaurants in the area and need a place i know wont be too busy|this place has gone downhill and i dont expect that we will be going back in fact i dont expect it to be in business past christmas they raised their prices changed the menu and removed several of our favorite dishes from the menu the veggie dumplings are gone the jasmine iced tea is gone and the minidessert are gone the food is meh my broccoli was mushy in the ginger chicken and the sauce was like candy because it was too sweet|first of all i love pfchangs but i  recently visited here and had really bad experience the waitress hardly paid any attention to us the hostess had to like help her i even wanted to order a togobut i couldnt find her so i just went up to the bar and ordered it  im a server myself so maybe i had high expectations but i still tipped her like  on  i still love it though  im not gonna be an asshole and say im never coming back bc i know i will lol|food was ok soup was hot  the server was nice but my coffee cup was dirty and sugar container had sticky prints of some sauce on the sides yuk i dont even like sugar with my coffee and how did his shirt get that dirty over lunch unless he was starting the dinner shift on saturday even worse but he smiled brought me a clean cup and i wiped the sugar container clean pet pev otherwise everything else was ok some times its the service a bad server ruins everything  if the server looks unkept and their station is dirty  i begin to wonder what other aspects of the service i cant see thats neglected  omg i dont want to think about itthank god i only ordered the soup and it was hot|disappointing  i expected more out of pf changs all i can say is that there is better chinese at a non chain place and it is cheaper wouldnt go back i you want chinese go to how lee or china palace|since i have foot problems and am limited as to the type of shoes i can wear i generally come here normally both of your feet are measured for accuracy  most styles come in european sizes so i am familiar with the size i normally wearthey also sell orthotics which you can put in sneakers or special orthodics for dress shoes if you have a foot problem they will give give you  off your purchase of the orthotic once your mention your doctors namei normally come here for sneakers sandals and on rare occasion a dress shoe they offer a reward program for the amount of your purchase once you reach a certain threshholdi have never had a problem with any of my orthotics and give them a high recommendation they do offer trunk shows which was the reason for my recent visit since i needed a pair of summer sandals and a waterproof sneaker for an upcoming trip normally they sell new balance for sneakers and their prices are relatively comparable to that which you would find in other shoe storeshowever the do carry some better lines so expect to pay a little more if you want the quality of a name brand shoe you are permitted to purchase the items and try it around the house to see if you are comfortable with it if unhappy then you have two weeks to return it at which point it becomes a final saletime will normally tell if i had made the right purchase or not i bought a pair of waterproof sneakers and an allegra sandal which is versatile they were kind enough to stretch the sneaker to make sure it wasnt bothering my bunionlocated at the waterfront parking can be a bit difficult but there is usually ample parking in the back of the complex|had lunch here after getting my nails done in the waterfront  its your standard panera  lots of seating and a sunny room from all the windows  our food was made very quickly even though the place was pretty busy lunch on a saturday  chicken noodle soup is tasty but there was too much broth and not enough noodles and chicken  i tried their sierra chicken sandwich for the first time and it was pretty good  its very flavorful i like whatever they put in their chipotle mayo  it was a salty meal though  definitely had me running to the fountain machine to get more waterif i have to get a quick light meal and only chain options are available panera is my best choice  its definitely predictable and usually tasty  but there isnt much special about it of course|ive had bad experiences here a few times now  i wrote panera bread and havent heard back  bad service all around  basically we ordered our food they ran out of what we wanted so just decided to make us something else with out telling us  when we got our food we asked why they made us that instead of what we orderedoh it was the closest to what you wantedhmmmm how about you tell us that before we pay and how about you give us our money back  really you dont get much for what you pay for at panera  its not very good at all|i like panera bread but this one is a so so i always get my fuji chicken salad in every panera bread i go all of the other use spring mix to make their fuji chicken salad except this one they just use regular salad and salad doesnt taste or look very fresh either i was kind of excited to find there is a panera bread around us but i am disappointed after trying it dont know if we will be back again|it seems silly to rate a chain so i wont talk about the food i just love coming to this panera because its right by barnes and noble  i recently started getting into the panera card compared to the other paneras i have to say that this one seems cleaner bigger and all around nicer  of course i would never go out of my way to get here but if youre at barnes and noble and arent happy with the sandwiches there which i was i would venture on over to panera|panera bread has to be the most inconsistent restaurant i have ever been to i have posted two pictures of the strawberry poppyseed chicken salad the first one looks delicious the second one looks like they couldve used a smaller bowl it did not even look appetizing|in general i like panera so rather than reviewing panerai overall im going to compare this panera store to other panera stores that ive been toive been here a couple times and so far no major complaints in terms of food and service the people are generally friendly honestly they are probably the friendliest panera staff ive seen in all of the panera stores ive been to in pittsburgh although i havent been to them all once i came in after breakfast time and asked for a quiche and they gave it to me without any problems i havent had to wait super long even if there are a lot of people however my biggest problem with this panera store is that there are hardly any outlets and seating is rather a pain i like to go to panera to eat and do work at the same time but its rather hard when there arent many seats and very few outletsfood  stars  just your average panera foodservice  stars  as mentioned pretty good experienceseating  star  dont come here to work or come with a huge partyoverall  stars|sometimes i use panera as a lunch place and sometimes i use it as an office either way i tend to spend a lot of time at panera if i am meeting someone i prefer to sit in a booth for more privacy i like the homey feel of panera and love it when i get to sit by the fireplace the bakery items are always fresh its nice that they keep the chocolate chip cookies warm yumthe food is unpredictable sometimes its good and sometimes its not so good the serving sizes on their soups and salads have shrunk considerably in the last year they do have a good selection of food they keep adding healthier options their recent addition is soba noodle bowls they look good but i sense a lot of sodium hides in them if you need a place to meet someone to chat or get some work done it is a good place food wise there are many other choices to consider around the city for better food at the same prices|this panera bread location is ideally located in the waterfront shopping center in the midst of several shops and a large parking lot the space itself is much larger than many other locations i have been to and has ample seating which is always a good thing unfortunately the service is slow and unfriendly there was no line and it took a few moments for someone to notice there were customers trying to order i was surprised that i was automatically given a baguette with my meal rather than being offered a choice between the bread an apple or a bag of chips perhaps it is this location or maybe it was just a oneoff oversight as i mentioned there is plenty of seating but our options were limited because all of the tables were disgusting with trash on them and in desperate need of a wipedown if it were over lunch or a rush i would be more sympathetic but there were only a handful of patrons in the entire establishment i was also upset that the wifi was not functioning despite my nitpicking the food was fine and it is a standard panera just not a stellar location|it has been several months since i visited panera bread it is a bakery cafe chain with free wifi prices are reality the same although from time to time they change their seasonal offeringsfood is fair you order and you are given a buzzer to let you know when your food is ready they use real dishes and silverware the menu gives you a calorie count of each item you are purchasing  one of the popular feature items is you pick two where you can have half a sandwich or salad or soup in a pair of two of those items you also get with it a choice of an apple or roll and you can add a dessert for i was disappointed to learn they had removed the french onion soup from the menu i asked about this removal only to learn there was something wrong with one of the ingredients the other disappointment was that this year they are not making gingerbread men which are one of my favorite holiday treats instead they are offering a holiday themed sugar cookiei normally eat here when im in a hurry and dont have time to sit down at a regular restaurant they do use fresh breads and they do cater you can also order your holiday baked goods or breads for your parties|the problem i have this experience compared to my last is that the examination lasted  minutes  the vet checked the ears teeth and nails then called it a day  i came home looked at his teeth and saw my pup had a slab fracture  which was still attached to the gum  the vet didnt mentioned it during the exam other than telling me to buy a finger brush to brush his teethi was primarily there for a vaccination shot but if theyre going to charge me for a examination they should do a proper examination  i just felt i was rushed out of there i took my dog to another vet where they told me about the slab fracture gave me info on how it usually happens potential problems that it can cause and recommendations on ways to fix the problem|i mean its target it has everything you just need to know what to buy there and not get sucked into the convenience of buying everything in one spotbeware  though their merchandise looks nice and its a good buy for a student you dont want to make longterm purchases here the zipper on a skirt i bought broke the first time i wore it ive heard horror stories about disintegrating comforters during their first washthat said their storebrand toiletries and other sundry items are fairly cheap and they have a wider selection than giant eagle or cvs they also have a cool program with flickrcom  you can upload your photos order them online from targets onehour photo kiosk and pay by credit card when you pick them upi love their cheap accessories  glasses bags jewelry along with claires and filenes target is my favorite place to shop for those things|its not the greatest target of all time but it still meets all of your basic needsif youre looking for produce lower prices and bigger selection in every department then head to the target in east liberty|it always feels like everyone who shops at this target is moving in slow motion just sayinotherwise its pretty much so like any other target the lines were crazy long today and i was only buying one thing i was relieved when they sent a few more cashiers in and opened up some more lines it definitely expedited what was looking to be a very long wait|surprised how empty the restaurant was tonight   first time at this location  great service but wasnt hard to dohad a combination orange shrimp and chicken and chicken fried rice  it was typical pf changs very good  you can get the fried rice off the kids menu for  versus  for a big bowl off the regular menu|targeti like target more than i like walmart walmart is badi like target enough to return i like it enough to pass by any walmart that my throw itself in my path does that mean i love target no it is just ok|is it me or when i shop at target and get to the register the total is always double what i anticipated it be  am i the only onetarget reminds me of hills when i was a kid  since the rise of amazon i find it kind of pointless to visit any more  they do have good prices of cds and sometimes a hell of a deal on games but nothing you couldnt find looking hard on ebaysave your gas if your not close but if you need something quick i dont see why you shouldnt use target as your option|i can live at target sometimes i find myself coming back over and over to look at house and kitchen stuff i absolutely dont need maybe i need new pillows or thank you notes no i still need to come look at them because its target addictingthis one is closer to my house and its a relatively nice size i wouldnt rave about customer service because its very very basic or sometimes doesnt exist on my last visit i had a young lady ringing me up and talking to her friend on the side at the same time she couldnt scan some soap so she asked me what the price was and i couldnt remember but i knew it was on sale for twosomething dollars instead of checking it out i watched her enter  as she continued to speak with her friend i found some other mistakes as well when im out on the floor browsing i rarely ever get anyone asking if i need any help if any associates happen to be nearby  of the time i dont actually need help but its the thought that counts i guessi dont usually grocery shop at target but if i do need something then this one is fine for me its a good location parking is easy carts are always available with wipes to sanitize theres a starbucks in there umm hello addiction  and you can find some good deals i like how they have easy to findbrowse clearance sections at the end of aisles if you have their target card then some of the sales give you gift cards for a purchase and you get  off all your purchases with that card i still love you target always|the waterfront as a whole is a pretty busy shopping area and this particular target is no different  with a bunch of big box stores and restaurants at this side of the mall it can get pretty busy here  this target however to me seems like one of the more disorganized ones compared to the many others ive been to  clothing displays are very mixed up that is many things are on racks mixed up with other things  i found a wall hanging i liked but it was hard to go through them where the diagonal racks storing them were  some of the toys seem to be like that too  its not as easy to find things here as other places  things are or end up being where they just dont seem to belong for one reason or anotherthe one saving grace of most of the target stores including this one is the check out lines are very fast and efficient  that and the aisles are large enough to negotiate around because they seem wide enough that you dont feel so tight like at walmart|i find this target to be average although im here quite a bit i guess im just used to where everything is at the east liberty location i always feel so lost here its decent though the checkout lines move quickly|watch out when it looks like something is on sale  they mark a rack or table with a big buy one get one or  off sign then only some of the stuff on the rack is on sale|this place is bohunk central tuxedo jacket fit great white slim fit shirt looked ridiculous it was so big that i literally could jump off a skyscraper and land safely my friend got sized and this new guy super nice measured his  inch waist at  he looked really terrible at the wedding and was super depressed about it his jacket didnt fit and his white shirt was worse than mine ithe staff was really nice though its not their problem that mens warehouse picks vendors that support a  pound male frame i hope i never rent a tuxedo from mens warehouse again|i got a cheese pizza delivery from here once and i feel likeits one of those places where its okay and if thats what someone put in front of me i would eat it but i definitely wouldnt go omg lets eat thereit was just boring to me and i love cheese pizzabut some of my coworkers like to eat here on occasion so maybe some of their other stuff is better i wouldnt know|its not that delish|the pizza is definitely good the wings arent crisp and they dont provide a dipping sauce for the wings|this bed bath  beyond seems like your average store location i dont have anything too bad or too exciting to say about this location descent products and descent service i would just recommend taking all of your bed bath  beyond coupons with you when shopping because staff will help you combine them as best as possible|just okay often crowded on weekends for food that while im sure well prepared is not the most flavorful  this store is literally next door to the headquarters of eat n park so its a safe bet that this is the best one there isstrawberry pies being the exception to the rule  there are better places to eat for the same money|is it a pittsburgh thing maybe so but that is no excuse for this crumby diner chain the few times i have dined if thats what you want to call it at an enp i felt like committing sepaku hari  kiri i never got sick from the food but more disgusted with myself for stooping to this level of gastronomy nothing really worthwhile on the menu maybe a burger how much can you mess that up my gut just tells me not to trust e n ps  no offense to truck drivers of america bc they keep supplies on our selves but it  reminds me of a truck stop restaurant without the truck drivers i always seem to migrate to the salad bar and get weirded out for having to deal with the utensils that pick up the salad so i wind up washing my hands after getting my salad stuff the waterfront  e n p is perhaps the cleanest one i have been to but thats not saying much bc the patrons are kinda off so an extra star for this location but its not like i would ever say to my friends in ny sf london or whereverhey when you come to pittsburgh be sure to go to an e n p to get the flavor of the city obviously this place appeals to a certain class of people of which i guess i cant be a part of as much as i want to be at times|eat n park has become my standby in the area  i truly do enjoy what i get at this little dinerfast food chain  ordered the following itemsstuffed pepper soup and salad barchicken noodle soupblack angus bbq burger with macaroni and cheesehot turkey sandwichpepsii love the fact that i can serve my own soup and create my own salad at the bar  i really love the fact that the salad bar has such good ingredients that are atypical for most places  i would stay away from the pepper soup it was not very good  the hamburger is nothing special but it tastes good is not overcooked and has a good barbeque sauce with onions that are actually cooked  the macaroni and cheese is better from stouffers out of the freezer  i abstained from the turkey and just relished in my burger and salad spinach greens cucumbers cherry tomatoes sunflower seeds and balsamic vinaigrette  i will continue to return|being next door to corporate you would have higher expectations the breakfast bar is lame back home fayette county there seems to be a lot more variety such as corn fritters apple cinnamon thingies and little potato cakes to name a few the salad bar is just as bad the side dishes they offer are usually ruined with meat which makes no sense to me because the tiny ham cubes and bacon bits are already on the bar so if anyone wanted to add them into their linguini salad or whatever they couldthe late night patrons are a bit unsavory speaking of which my ex roommate used to work here and i could tell you some stories but i dont want to freak you out|i went here around  am on january   after new years eve they had a breakfast buffet laid outid barely gone to any eat n parks this past year because my local one in edgewood is horrible so i was pleasantly surprised that there was nothing wrong here we were seated quickly the waiter handled the beverage orders quickly and the buffet was fine no problems at all except when the place got completely packed around  am and we had a bit of trouble tracking down the waiter to get our check that wasnt a big deal thoughi cant justify giving more than  stars due to the fact that eat n park isnt exactly fine dining but we got filling food for minimal hassle so it was a good experience overall|much like every other eat n park  or  stars worth of chaindiner food except the last five times ive been here the service has been damn damn daaaaaaaamn slow  its always fun to see the staff smoking out back while ive waited an hour for some scrambled eggs|if you must eat at eat n park this is the one you want to go to why you ask the corporate offices are right next door and the suits are there every day breakfast lunch and dinner when i spend a few hours with dear old mom she enjoyed spending a day at the waterfront she loved the since closed  center store where she could buy her monthly greeting cards for  cents each then we drive over to this eat n park where she has her breakfast smile and i enjoy an egg beater sandwich and fresh fruitthis place is spotless the salad bar always looks fresh and the food is good for a chain|they burned my fish and they burned it bad  ordering fish at eatn park is always a gamble  i just never know how its going to turn out  im a risk taker so i ordered two pieces of baked lemon sole well it went terribly wrong  my waiter came out and said they burned your fish so i had them put two new pieces in the oven  i was impressed by his honesty and didnt mind waiting for two new pieces   i gladly helped myself to my boyfriends french toast while i waited then out of no where another server comes to the table with the burnt fish and sets it down infront of me with the burnt side down of course  that just shows the kitchen is not in total coordination  like i said getting fish from eatn park is a toss up in the end i got two nicely baked pieces of sole to replace the burnt ones so i left satisfied|yes i know that its cheap diner food but cmon you have your corporate headquarters within walking distance and this is all you can serve up my husband and i were craving a late night snack after seeing a movie a couple weekends ago and decided to try this eat n park location for the first time i had always been adequately satisfied at other locations so i thought this restaurant would be worth a tryi ordered several items  sweet potato fries with apple butter dip hot chocolate and pumpkin creme pie i think my husband ordered some sort of burger or sandwich anyway every item was problematic in some way the fries were good but the apple butter was oddly thick and sweet the hot chocolate had creative chocolate syrup drizzling that was running all down the cup and saucer i had to carefully drink the beverage  which was ok  because i was afraid that i would get the syrup all over my hand face and clothes the pumpkin creme pie looked like it was sliced by a  year old it looked like it had been carelessly cut and plopped onto the plate where it appeared very flat and unappetizinghowever our waitress was the sweetest middleaged woman our food took a little time to get to our table not too bad though and she comped two of the items i believe the hot chocolate and the pie from our bill she was very attentive and kind while we dined there and i made sure that my husband gave her a good tip if i remembered her name i would definitely mention it in this reviewhowever despite our kind service im not planning on returning to this location any time soon|some how even though the food at this eatn park is down right abominable the smiles and laughter is always there  how can i stay mad when the prices or so cheep myself my boyfriend and his nephew had lunch with milkshakes and me having a coffee it was on this particular occasion the fire alarm went off and rang and rang and rang loud and long for over  minutes before the fire department got there realized they didnt have key to turn it off and than another  minutes later finally shut it offonly at eatn parkmy baked potato was hard as a rock i had ordered two pieces of baked cod and only received one the waitress was very sweet and attentive and really attempted to build a rapport with our lil nephew which i thought was sweet|the food is usually pretty good however the service is almost always very very slow most of the staff are pretty friendly and sweet but there are a few sour ones in the bunch that make the experience not as nice as it could be although they still technically do their job you can feel very negative vibes from them and see how inefficient they are with the way they do things its a hit and miss unless you know one of the servers and their schedules the low rating is mainly for the slow service and the handful of staff members who arent very pleasant|they make a nice breakfast for less than the tip form dinner the night before  thats not bad|eat n park is usually decent  this location though has horribly slow service  seriously we never wait less than  minutes for a server to acknowledge us and we live near the waterfront so weve given this location the benefit of the doubt numerous times  each time hoping that the last was just a fluke new staff or something  its not  doesnt matter what time we go  it seems we are not acknowledged for several minutes and then the service is mediocre at best  occasionally weve had a stellar service but its few and far between  today after waiting  minutes then getting up to find a server in another section we were informed that we were sitting in a closed section  that server offered to serve us but honestly we left  i told the hostess who seated us about the mixup and got a blank stare  ive never had this issue at any other enp  we left drove to the squirrel hill location and our orders were taken in the amount of time we wasted at the waterfront  mgmt you have a beautiful prime location  get your hosts and servers on the same page|food is decent service is always hit or miss great for a quick family breakfast buffett for kids is free with an adult boom|i was in a jam and was meeting relatives for an impromptu breakfast this was not fast and easy however they did a great job making a slow experience by giving us free cookies and very nice service my egg whites spinach omelette was excellent|god i hate eat n park only reason i have gone is for the salad bar because u cant find a decent salad bar in this city just about every entree iv had here is nothing more than rubbish except maybe the cheesteak only go if u have little kids|poor service from the door  i walked in and was ignored  when i walked in they were more worried about the lack of pies in the case than they were in seating customers  in fact the person that entered after me was attended to before i was even acknowledged  i mean im no skinny person by a long shot but if im standing in front of the hostess podium i expect to be noticed at least  when i was finally seated things went a little smoother  that might be because i opted for the salad bar and didnt have to have anyone bring me the items from there  i really expected better from this location especially since it is basically next door to the home office  there was no line or mad rush to get in here i just baffled|eat n park is the place for smiles but mine is kind of that emoji that has a squiggly line thins i like about enp you always know what youre getting standard across the board pies great baked goods great  soup good  who doesnt love a smiley cookie  they are a charitable group and i think thats awesome things that make me squiggly smile i ordered the basic breakfast smile the other day i asked to hold the toast and potatoes and swap a fruit cup get the lessthanhalfcup of fruit and its sub par yes winter but isnt their ideal to use what is in season i can still find some sort of fruit in grocery store thats decent and youre a major chain find a supplier what really was disappointing was that my server upcharged me  for lessthanhalfcup now i have worked in the past for many years yes some swaps do require an additional charge but really i just gave you back potatoes and toast for clear fruit she did take it off but im sure she was doing what is practice so if i would have paid for that it would have been over  bucks for two eggs two pieces of bacon which is a buck a piece on up charge on friends sandwich and coffee and basically three bites of fruit eat n park is the place for squiggly smiles|i thought this is a nice place to eat if you have a family lot of options food was pretty good and cheap was satisfied with my meal had fish with veggiesyears ago and did tell others that this was a nice optionits not super gourmet but it is a place you can grab a nice meal at a good price|we had  people so we had our own room the server janee started off strong setting a tone for our meal that she would be organized and on point  unfortunately that was the high point of this service  we sat there for  minutes without drinks in fact some meals started coming out and we still didnt have our beverages  half the table had pepsi or diet pepsi the other half had water and two people had dr pepper  im not sure why they couldnt just get pitchersi got the salad bar only it was ok but it was messy so when you went to add items other items were mixed in which is kind of gross i thought the chili was overly salty  the other people we were with didnt have much good to say about their meals with the exception of the angus burger  janee did stop and take a picture of our whole table which was nice and we were there three hours so she did earn her pay but she set the expectation high that she knew what she was doing and it fell flat pretty fast  im not sure it was all her fault as she didnt seem to have a staff that was working to support her just catch her up as needed  i think if you have  people at a table  staff members would make you more successful  when we went to leave i bought a dozen of the sugar cookies  the person at the counter didnt know how to ring them up and was quite rude when i asked for her to ring them up like i was doing her a disservice by asking to purchase the restaurants products  that was my first time at eatn park and i think i would prefer to just eat at dennys next time|i was somewhat disappointed that i didnt find what i was looking for  this is a fairly small marshalls  it didnt look like the store received the worst items around they just dont appear to have a lot of diversity like many of the other marshalls that i patronize  will i return  yeah i will  i had one item in mind that i was looking for and didnt look for very many other things|went in here to grab a last minute item i needed for an outfit  i wasnt going to hold my breath here either i know its a marshalls and that doesnt always mean the best selection  its hit or miss no matter what you are looking forthis day was a hit maybe even a home run  i do have to admit the kenneth cole shirt i got not only looked great on me but made my wallet feel even better|since both marshalls and tj maxx are owned by the same company i make sure to stop by both locations when shopping at the waterfront i generally find nothing or spend only  or so at marshalls while being enticed to spend at least  at tj maxx the waterfront tj maxx seems to have not only the same product as this marshalls plus a whole lot more all that to say i consider shopping here a waste of time since i could just drive a block or so and be at a store owned by the same company that always has what i want and need sorry marshalls but youre just ok to me|if youre looking for a wallet a new cheap purse or something of that naturethis is the place to gootherwise this kind of shopping just isnt for mei dont have the patience for clothes shopping here thoughthe racks drive me nuts bc theyre in no particular orderits shirtssizes pantssizes jeanssizes coatssizesi cant look through a gazillion racks of shirts looking for something i like aimlessly in a m or l i just cant do it  lolwish i could id probably find some dealsprossome good dealsconsyouve gotta dig deep to find em|not quite sure if i really need to review marshalls since im probably not going to say much that hasnt already been said i noticed all other reviews are  or  stars as well i prefer the marshalls in greensburg but my husband likes to stop in here whenever were down at the waterfront and heck why not its hit or miss of course at times i can find absolutely nothing but not on this last trip i scored my new favorite tank top for  the h in desperate need of new black work socks found some for eight bucks it was actually a  pack of socks but came with an extra pair so  pairs of socks for not too shabby i also found a super cute homemadeesque wedding card for my cousins upcoming wedding for  any day with bargains is a good day|mitchells fish market is a very nice place to eatfor a chain restaurant  and actually if it wasnt a chain it wouldnt be too bad either  the atmosphere was surprisingly pleasant  the room was warm and intimate perfect for a date  it wasnt too noisy or too crowded and we were seated right away on a friday around  pmour server was friendly and happy to give recommendations  i started with a house salad which i told the server i would split with my boyfriend  she brought it to us on two separate plates which i thought was a nice touch and more than what i expected  poppy seed dressing was okay its pretty thick and creamy as i remember but tastyi ordered from the special menu since they had a bit of a lobster promotion going on  my entree was a combo lobster tail and lobster pot pie  now lobster is a beautiful thing but i have to sayit wasnt beautiful here  it wasnt awful but it didnt taste as fresh as i like im guessing thats because the meat was frozen originally  its just a shame  dipping the lobster in butter was a pleasant experience but its supposed to be an ecstatic onethe lobster pot pie was totes not what i imagined  i pictured a flaky golden crust a delicious creamy lobstery gravy and big hunks of lobster and vegetables  insteadi got what sort of resembled a small bread bowl made of a biscuit  there was a lot of sauce which was surprisingly orange in color and very rich with some lobster chunks and vegetables that appeared to come from a bag of frozen veg id recognize those tiny squareshaped carrot chunks anywhere  whaaaaaaaat  it wasnt bad or anything but not what i imagined  i was a little bummed out  so everything we ate was just fine and nice when youre craving seafoodbut i think in future id rather just head to the strip get a lobster and cook the sucker up myself  i didnt try their fresh preparations so i cant say how those wereid say in the waterfront though its probably one of your better options  healthier and fresher than most of the other choices  and the atmosphere is great including the service|got lunch from here today what i sampled maine lobster bisque delicious and the whole reason for getting lunch from herecheeseburger decent version i only ate about half but i expect the other half wont last longoverall i enjoy going here though it is a bit overpriced but sometimes i am just in the mood for that lobster bisque|good food and service but our party was skipped over or crossed off the waiting list after an hour we went up to find that there were three tables open the manager very blatantly lied to us stating that they had just opened up and just been cleaned food was good but not worth the hassle and wait there are better or cheaper places to eat in pittsburgh|i am bummed about this i had high hopes heres a rundown of the eveningpros super friendly waitress stephanie who maintained her professionalism and friendliness throughout  yummy elderflower and pear beverage lobster bisque was nice and lobstery hot delicious breadcons oysters were sketch and i dont feel good about that stephanie brought us an order of east coast oysters to replace the west coast ones that we sent back fresh grated horseradish had no flavor or heat whats up with that scallops were meh came with weird veggies unevenly seared and no real flavor and at a whopping  a plate i expect some nummersi doubt well go back for those prices i would prefer mccormicks or ruths chris|service an atmosphere was great i had the shrimp boil and it was very underseasoned much closer to bland than anything|i went here on a recent business trip and there arent many decent options in west homestead so i decided to splurge on the companys dollar and  ordered takeout   i was highly disappointed in the service and i only ordered take out    upon going to the bar to announce that i was there for take out there were  other people at the bar   the bartender had her back to me and it wasnt until a few minutes had passed that another guest told her that she should wait on me    after announcing the reason for my visit she checks on my order not ready yet and helps other tables  no offer of water or a drink  another gentleman working the bar asked the bartender if she had offered me a drink she stated to him my order would be right up   he then asked if she offered me a water to which she replied her order is going to be right up    he placed a glass of water in front of methen i hear my name and order announced by the kitchen staff    staff members yelled   its takeout  so back it went into the kitchen to be packed upgentelman bartender asks female bartender if she has rung me up yet she had notafter more time had passed how long does it take to put food into a takeout container   it finally is put down in front of me  she then rings me up   i dont expect take out to be piping hot but at this point i wondered if it was even going to be roomwhen i go to eat my meal utensils were not included  i now had to go find something to eat my lukewarm food with very disappointing experience   will not be returning|the service was mostly friendly but i was disappointed in my meal my meal was way over cooked the soda was flat and the carbonation needed changed and i felt like we inconvenienced our server by asking for new ones  overall i thought it was mediocre and i was expecting more for the prices|the food was really good but the prices were pretty high and the portions were on the small side the desserts were the high point of the meal for me i got the shark fin pie and it was really good the waitress thought i wouldnt be able to finish it but i showed her take that waitress|i have passed by this place a zillion times and never given it a second look  i thought it might be a red lobster knock off  then i asked a friend if they had ever heard of it and they had and liked iti was pleasantly surprised by how nice the ambiance was inside  very cozy  much more upscale than i had thought it would be  the service was terrific  lots of things to choose from on the menu  a bit pricier than i had imagined  most entrees were anywhere from  to   but this is pittsburgh and this is seafoodthat said they started us off with really delicious sour dough bread  butter was soft which i like  our entrees came pretty quickly  i had a seafood assortment of blackened talapia grilled sea scallops and salmon cooked on a plank  the scallops were just done i like them cooked a little more  everything else was pretty goodmy beloved had the crab cakes and really enjoyed themwell probably be back but will order something different   we liked it|food was only ok had lobster bisque soup not to good had the shang hai seafood sampler the scallops were hard over cooked the samon was good shrimp had no flavor i will say the service was the best our waiter was great|we had a bigger party and i think that might have flustered the waitresses just a bit they forgot about our waters until the food came out but were super apologetic when they did bring them the food was ok i ordered the crab cakes they were a bit heavy on the breading so i would give them a rating of eh my friend ordered a steak asked for medium rare and it came outwell done he was too hungry to complain and just ate it we might go back again and this time maybe take a bit more time looking over the menu|i have eaten some very good dinners here  although its a chain i would say its several notches above the other chain restaurants  the chef here seems to add some creativity to the menu so i will be definitely back again soon|top points service i was there with a large group for a meeting they gave us a private room and two servers took care of us they were efficient and very accommodating kudos appetizers had the crab dip and calamari both were good servers brought extra chips with the dip as they were needed im always surprised that more chips are not just added to the original dish at this point dip was good calamari was done well preferred the shrimp cocktail sauce with it versus the asian type soy sauce that is served with it wedge salad with bleu cheese waaaaaay too much cheese and i like bleu cheese i had the blackened tuna with mashed potatoes and seasonal veggies carrots were carrot sticks hardly cooked and dry green beans overdone and broccoli had seen better days simple green beans would have been more appetizing tuna had blackening spices but needed a better sear on it was not over cooked potatoes as expected other dishes seenfishermans platter looked a little greasy but thats expected from me in a full fried dish would be nice if this was offered broiled as well crab cakes and filet looked okay overall im always underwhelmed and overcharged here i guess with chain places you get that but i want more from a place that charges me  bucks for subseared tuna|we went here for thanksgiving dinner we had called ahead to check out vegan options but the person on the other end was a little grumpy about the matter but theres so little open on that day there was little choice except to make sure i ate a big lunch earlieri ordered the thai salad which is probably the only vegan item on the menu  really just a coleslaw with a peanut sauce and some funky chips  i also ordered some grilled vegetables  both were good but not amazing the beer selection was really bad i mean dive bar stuff however the slightly pricey wine selection redeemed the place and we had a great red and white  the service too was pretty good but i simply cant recommend going here due to the poor selection of vegan items|not impressed at all  the first time we ordered drinks our server forgot our drinks and the second time we had to ask if we could have more drinksi ordered white frutti di mare for  and i only got  scallops and  small shrimps  our bill was  way to pricey for  scallops and pasta|the food was delicious excellent seafood and plenty of things to choose from on the menu however the service we experienced was terrible we sat at our table for  minutes before anyone even noticed we were there keep in mind we were here late afternoonearly evening so the place was half empty once we ordered my draft beer took  minutes to come out then it was wrong i kept it anyways or else id probably still be sitting there waiting for it good food but i wont be in a hurry to go back|i have mixed feelings about this place i have eaten there twice i have enjoyed the flavors of their shanghai option both times the seafood has been cooked well the sharkfin pie is tasty for dessert however both times i had shrimp as part of my entree mitchells is a perfect two for two at forgetting to devein the shrimp first time i ate there two of my shrimp were not deveined second time there was one i only had two if you order shrimp take a good look at it the management has been very apologetic and helpful both times they truly cared|first time in pittsburgh on biz and staying in the waterfront district nice selection of better than average chain restaurants on the area spotted mitchells seafood and since i never heard of ot before decided to make it my evening dinner choice  in fact looked forward all day to a nice shellfish dinner ala bonefish grill they have a nice al fresco patio overlooking the river that i wish i say at  place was pretty empty at  pm on a monday night but thats to be expected i ordered the seafood americana which was supposed to have sauted shrimp and scallops in a light butter sauce what i got in return was a plate of small shrimp in a brown gravy with no scallops whatsoever i immediately returned the dish and the young and nice manager came over to make it right so i reordered a different steamed shrimp and scallops dish which was much better  larger shrimp and  sea scallops over spinach and veggies with a soy sauce on the side  very nice but wish they had drained the ingredients better so they didnt end up on a soupy broth  having waited tables in a high end seafood restaurant through graduate school i am tempted to attributing this experience to monday night late dinner inexperienced cooks and lack of kitchen or server oversight i hope your experience is better than mine too many other good choices nearby to give them a second chance  sorry  disappointed|traveling with my boss we had dinner here since it was convenient to the hotel food was good as usual but we ended up with a young man who had not been a waiter for very long brought us a bottle of cabernet when we ordered a bottle of chardonnay  told us he had never opened a bottle of wine before expected better service at a place like mitchells|will not eat here again waitress angela could not be found for  minutes at a time the entire meal was a running commentary on where she was and why we didnt even get water refills until dinner came she had to be specifically asked three times for water before we got our one and only refill spilled mussel butter on my jacket and although she did apologize no manager ever came over to see if we were okay when i did complain they offered a  gift card which didnt even cover the cost of said jacket thanks but no thanks when asked specifically if a dessert was served warm the waitress said yes of course but spoiler alert it wasnt party involved said it was fine and asked me not to say something when asked if they had a very specific after dessert drink the waitress replied in the affirmative only to substitute irish coffee instead if you are out of something just own up to it dont try to pull one over on someonelong story short  decent if overpriced food nonexistent management and the worst service i have experienced in a long while as a server myself i am pretty forgiving but the nonservice ruined a  meal and mitchells management couldnt care less|very disappointing  i have been a patron of this restaurantlocation since it openedusually dining there about once a month  my last few visits were fine not great but fine  today was not  the restaurant was about half full i was with one other person     food  my friend had a ceasar salad  the staff didnt know where the anchovies were therefore none  it was served at room temperature  chefs special was penne in a light alfredo sauce with crab and shrimp  it also was served at room temperature  i had the scallops with stir fried vegetables  the scallops too were at room temperature and only seared on one side some not at all  the manager offered to redo the meals which we accepted  she shrugged her shoulders and said she didnt know what else she could do  the scallops were better the nd time penne was watery crab was all but invisible  the garnish had cheese on it the first time not the nd  penne was mediocre at best     service probably the worst service ive ever had there  our server seemed overwhelmed apologized continually to us and every other table she had nearby  maybe that was part of the reason our meals were not hot the first time  never did get a refill on iced tea     ambiance the place is starting to look tired  the tables are showing their age the surface hasnt been kept up the finish has long since worn off in the most used partssorry to see this place go down hill  have many memories of better times  may not ever go back  looking for a new place in the area|the food here is good but also pretty pricey you might get more mileage and value spending the same somewhere else however this would be nice for a business lunch the decor and atmosphere is classy and there is something for everyone on the menualbeit it is all very seafood focused of courseive found the wait staff to be professional and personablethis location has outdoor seating that overlooks the river|after a long but beautiful day touring pittsburgh and riding the duquesne incline we settled down for a late dinner at mitchells fish marketwe were seated in a picture perfect spot by the window as requested our waiter initially greeted us warmly but the service went south quickly and i trying to wrap my head around  why  what was wrong with the service you wondered wellwe had to wait a long time for our drinks appetizers ordered but not received requested bread several times waiter was oblivious to the request  dinner took for ever it felt like a century later it was good thing we was on vacation so we had time to waste we observed the other waiters and waitress was busy attending to their patrons on the plus side the food was divinely delicious  salmon scallops super fresh and melted in my mouth  my husbands dish ordered the shrimp and crab cakes and he hummed  yum to every bite he ate  unfortunately service and excellent service should go hand and hand  if only the head manager who was consistently walking around to various tables talking to patrons would have stop at our table we could have given him the scoop about our lack of service  on well|mitchellswhat have you done  i have been to this location several times and always loved it just never got around to writing a review  the patio area is great when the weather is nice and ive historically loved the fish preparations   this last trip though was a pretty steep slide downhill  first i went to the bar and ordered a glass of the house pinot grigioa generous poor from a bottle that was definitely a couple days past its prime   you should know better   then onto the table  im pretty sure the hostess double sat the server who was supposed to take care of me because she expressed her frustration right in the middle of the patio area  i waiting a few minutes and then someone else ended up taking care of me   the service was fine but i was a little put off by the start  what really got me though was the menu  mitchells used to have a great menu and ive always been thrilled with my selections  i dont know what changed but it was something  i ordered the crispy ginger salmon with stir fried vegetables   the portion was ample but the fish was sort of mushy and the crispy ginger topping wasnt crispy at all  the veges were half overcooked and half undercooked  if i didnt include this last visit id have given it  stars  this last visit brought it down   heres hoping that whatever changed changes back|last night was my first visit to mitchells and i was really looking forward to some great seafood  i am sorry to say i did not get it  i ordered the crab stuffed shrimp and was disappointed  there were five very small shrimp on the plate  the shrimp were dry and overcooked  the crab stuffing was mostly stuffing  all i tasted was breading  i didnt see a piece of lump crab anywhere  the best part of the meal was the bread and butter  i was with a party of  people and i was surprised to see such small portions on the others plates  for the prices at this place i had hoped for so much more  i will not go back|i love eating in the beautiful river setting though it is right by where the bloody homestead steel strike took place in   i would have given this place a higher rating based on past visits  but my most recent experience was not quite as good  the waitress spoke too fast and gave me misinformation about what sides came with the plank of fish  she did offer to fix the mistake but i let it go and traded sides with another person who was with me i think broiled is better than the plank  i still will eat at mitchells at least once each time i visit pittsburgh  the food is healthy and i enjoy being there|i want to like this place more than i do its definitely at least decent its a family style seafood restaurant that has a bit of class to it pretty nice visually and service is good as well especially at the front desk ive taken a couple of people there for birthdays and they do a nice job with that without being obnoxious with the ceremony if you make a birthday reservation you can actually get happy birthday bob or whatever printed on your menus for the evening nice touch food is just solid thats why i dont give them more stars ive had a few things here and theres nothing special about their flavors although their presentations are nice ive been a couple of times and havent had anything id be excited about basically a safe family style classier midscale seafood choice|its just like old navy anywhere  well maybe not the one in san francisco which is always packed  it ws pre thanksgiving so quiet before the storm on black friday  i picked up my one and only bargain of the weekend  a  pair of flip flops it was preparing to snow outside|after further consideration this store does not deserve a  star review the old navy product has been pretty weak recently which isnt the stores fault but the severe lack of customer service doesnt help the situation while shopping here on friday i was one of maybe  people in the store i would practically walk into a sales associate but not even receive a glance or smile no one working here seems to give an iota whether or not product is being sold to avoid inconveniencing the associates i will be taking my old navy purchases online in the future|im not too impressed with this particular dicks sporting goods it is in a great location in the waterfront but the selection seems a bit limited to me they have what you need but they dont have many options it seemsi went in there the other day and it looks like they also have a snowboarding section now which they definitely did not have last season they also have hunting golfing and biking in addition to the other regular deptartments your normal dicks nothing spectacular but it will do|i have visited this old navy location four or five times over the past year and have never had an issue in fact a friend and i visited the store around christmastime and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful however this was the not my experience yesterday i drug my husband along so i could look for new jeans and maybe find some sweaters  winter clothes on sale there were signs up exclusively for old navy credit card users which i am not however the sale of buy two get one free on thermals ended on january th two days prior then there was regular sign that simply stated buy two get one free i was confused as to whether this applied to everyone or just o n card users so i find an employee the only one on the floor and she says that the sale applies to everyone that the one for credit card holders is old well take it down rightat checkout there are cashiers both waiting on one customer no one else in line the male cashier does not have his light on so i opt for the other lane there is a cashier a woman and what appears to be a manager a younger woman there is some issue regarding the patrons purchase from what i can figure she opened up an o n card and was supposed to get a discount but it didnt come off her total my husband and i stood in line for several minutes no one even looked at usnot even to say sorry be right with yousomething no acknowledgement whatsoever me already being cursed with an impatient personality gather my items and move to the other register after about five minutes i ask the male cashier if he can ring me up he says that he can when hes done with the current customer duh i say great thanks i wasnt sure since youre light isnt on to which he just shrugs ummmneedless to say not the best of experiences this time just hoping that maybe some college kids called off or something and that they were understaffed will return but not for the customer service|i dont see to many options in pittsburgh for sporting goods dicks seems to be the big chain for sporting paraphernalia in this neck of the woods their selection is poor especially in the snowboarding and biking section maybe its good for small children who want their first snowboard it is a very average store with average products i would like to see some attempt to carry more high end products i am not into fishing or hunting live prey so i am not sure about these departments i guess if you want some under armor products then this is the place to go because i see aisles upon endless aisles of these types of products|monopoly completei finally understand why and how dicks sporting goods can charge the prices they do  there is no competition  come on people i need these warming items to keep from turning into a salcicle and i am paying a lot of money to accomplish this  the only saving grace is that the people are nice and the selection is there  can we get some lower prices|i enter every sporting goods stores as a soccer player runner and sports fan so my reviews will always be skewed towards those particular areas with that said this is probably the worst dicks location that ive ever been to the selection is very limited for soccer gear which must be a testament to the lack of the local customer base seeking out soccer gear its mostly lowend youth gear too which makes it nearly useless to adults or even some teenage soccer playersthe staff at this location has always been really nice though and its the closest location to where we live so i still end up going there quite a bit for running and clothing needs of course we usually leave emptyhanded as they dont have what were looking for they do have quite an extensive fan gear section if youre looking to support the local pittsburgh teams but this store just doesnt have the overall inventory necessary to be considered a good dicks location|this is an older dicks sporting goods location come here for the basics but dont expect to find the huge assortment that you would find at other dsgs throughout the city i wandered around here for  minutes or so one evening and did not have anyone approach me asking if i needed assistance i also found a small child in the back of the store playing dangerously on one of the elliptical machines which is something that both his parents and the stores staff should have addressed overall ill go here if i need sporting goods basics but would rather drive a little further to a nicer location|it is now a shop and save|living alone i love the  for  deals they have on meat i also love faygo products when i have a party or bbq so their sales are always right on time they dont have as many stores in the area but they are worth checking out the lines are a lot shorter and the staff is a lot friendlier|this store has changed hands many times over the past few years and it shows fifteen years ago if you didnt get there by am you would have fight a crowd now it never seems all that busy many of the stores best and dedicated employees left or were let go about five years ago and product lines change with each new owner the most recent owner seems to be improving the store and employee turnover has seemed to slow|staff in the deli is hit or miss you either get the girl who is nice and friendly or the one that hacks and coughs and roll their eyes at you when you order more than one item   the cashiers talk to one another and dont really pay attention to you and sometimes you have to watch them as they will ring up an item twice have had that happen many times   some sale prices are pretty good  deli prices are a bit high  ready made food prices a bit high for the quality you get     convenient bank hours though til  pm  also very good at keeping their sale items well stocked|i was at my friends house who lives in the area we stopped here for a few things it was a well kept giant eagle which seemed bright  clean in my opinion compared to city options north side south side the produce had great selection and i didnt see them out of things we needed we did self checkout so cant comment on the employees|for any locals im from the san francisco bay area so my views reflect my expectations there i wasnt entirely sure what to expect on my first visit to gian iggle but there werent too many surprises its pretty similar to safeway or luckys that is a huge amount of processed food and a passable produce section the produce was similar to what youd see in california this time of year maybe a touch more limited also it was holiday season so all the junk thats associated with that too the obvious differences were no alcohol section at all   you can wander down the strip mall to the beer store and buy mostly only in  packs apparently some of the giant eagles sell six packs but not this one  also for people from out of state check out the pierogi section and the chipped ham and other pittsburgh oddities for a vegan this is easy enough  lots of produce and all the things youd find in any other large chain|ive had mixed results here i would definitely recommend if buying a new bike but have had much less success with itemsparts ive ordered or with repairs|when i think bbb i think the days of simply bringing your bike in for a quick and relatively inexpensive tuneup and a few fixes are long gone    this review is more for the repair end of bbb in their defense bbb does appear to carry some amazing brands of bike ie colnago that you just dont find anywhere else in pittsburgh at bbb i was charged  for a tune up and a few other things granted this included installing a sew up tire which i can understand would cost approx  swapping out a left side big ring shifter on my down tube this should have cost approx  at most and installing new bar tape cost of tape  and  to install so whats with  for a tune up well the story goes like thisi bring the bike into bbb prior to the nice weather hitting pittsburgh in hopes of trying what people have said is a great bike shop and getting my oclv trek  ready for the season turns out i dont hear from these guys a week goes by two weeksi think thats ok i have two or three other bike i can turn to for a ride then i wind up going out of town for a week thinking for sure ill get a call from them re my bike is ready to rollbut no dice so i call turns out a screw snapped when the mechanic was reinstalling the down tube shifter and it had to be tapped out is that my fault he says should be ready in a few days so i come in a few days later to this mammoth bill i ask if i am paying for the labor of taping out the screw i dont think i ever got a straight answer i look at the bill and cant see a good breakdown of the charges normally i would duke it over a bill like this but i figuredi had somewhere i to be  minutes ago and at least i finally have my bike i would expect that for that money my bike could have been stripped down to the frame and totally gone over overhauled but it wasnt  well bbb ill give you a star because the mechanic did do a good job in that my cycle shifts well and the tape job on the bars looks great nice wrap plus ill toss in a star for your outstanding selection of high end cycles maybe i would have rated bbb higher if i was in the market for a purchase instead of a simple repair|bought a bike there on my second time in the shop   glen is very knowledgeable but can be a bit overwhelming annoying and pushy i can see how he can be very helpful to the average joe but if you are in his shop you should have done your homework as this place is not walmart mid to high level product here i would encourage getting fitted and even buying a bike there but going back for service is a whole different story  same day service is unheard of here even for the simplest of adjustments no service is available at all on the weekends  the first time i took a bike there to have a rear derailer hanger replaced and readjusted i had already purchased and had the hanger  days went by before i returned to pick my bike up after not being called  i figured it was just a fluke experience and gave them the benefit of the doubt  the second time i took a bike in to have a damaged shift lever replaced with a new  pair i called after  days and they said it wold be  days more  when i showed up  days later it still wasnt done it took  more following that  days total  stay away from their service department|okay so i just moved to the outskirts of duquesne pa which is outside of pittsburgh from harrisburg pa of all places where i am at really there is no delivery but these guys did they were nice and cordial and cheap but i have been spoiled by the pizza shop in harrisburg downtown run my an old world italian guy named luigi that pizza iswas miles better than this this crust while thin did not have flavor and was hard the slices were small for their  slice which i did like the cheese was good the sauce was meh ive definitely had way better  stars for being cheap and delivering|good pizza and i love the breadsticksi dont know too much else about this place|pizza is very hit or miss when the owners are there its really good when they arent you get pizza that is over cooked more like burnt and long delivery times the pizza even when plain is very greasy way more than other places around usually pizza that greasy is caused by low quality cheese also they do not take credit or debit cards there are better options|this place was really good  ordered the sampler plate with one small haluski one stuffed cabbage four pierogies i have to admit the haluski was epic omg the best i was like what am i eating soooo freakin good  the pierogies and the stuffed cabbage wasnt as amazing but it was tasty the crab cake was nasty yuck|the experience was not that great the lady taking the orders was nice but not helpful with what to order the owner kept her back turn to us the entire time based on the pictures and news articles i read about her i thought she would have been more social to what really matters we got  sampler and order of jalapeo pierogies and the ruben pierogies a lot of food for two guys really had no idea what to expect haluski was good the pierogies came luke warm and soaked in oily butter like the cab driver said you can find better id pass on this spot|decent pierogies but not the best ive had ive eaten  pierogies plus two times both times i got the potato  cheese pierogies they are good however they come in way too much butteroil they are probably soaked in at least a half a cup or more of butteroil when i get them i have to take them out of all the butteroil bc it would make me completely sick if i ate them as is other than that the pierogies themselves are decent however they are pretty pricey about  for  dozen recommend eating here if youre passing through or nearby but i wouldnt go out of my way|out and about at lunch decided to stop and grab something to eat    there was a nice selection of hot and ready pierogis to choose from which was nice and there were a few available behind the counter cold  most of the specialty type pierogies require special orders potato and meat etci had a meatball sandwich for  and it was tasty it was the size of a half meatball hoagie   the woman that waited on me said that the meatballs were homemade    of course i had to get some delicious pierogies potato and cheese submerged in butter and onions  i took them back to the office and shared|good food but really spotty service out of three trips one was excellent one involved us waiting for forty minutes for our cold food and one involved us waiting for fifteen minutes to even see a server before we just left money for a coffee so its not a bad place but definitely stick to the drive thru|moved into a new neighborhood get to try some new pies dpasquarellis pizza house jumped off of the page as the place to try yes on name alone haha after being told that they dont deliver to me and then that they do the actual order took place no you cant get double or extra pepperoni the pizza is not that good that they can dictate what you want on it or extra cheese no you cant get a menu and no we are out of hot sausage too many nos to me no we dont have coke or pepsi no we dont have bottles for all the noslarge pie with pepperoni and ham cans of mountain dew  seemed a little expensive compared to prices on mt wash where this would have been  no mas the delivery occurred ahead of the stated  minute time delivery guy was great the dough was a little tough in fact my jaw hurt after  slices i tried another piece about a half hour later and it was really tasty and the crust was a bit softer i also like the dirty crust  they flip the crust down to size covering a presauced section putting a small bit of sauce inside the crust they sauce the crust edges sloppy and get cheese all over the top dirty crust yummy|i have tried to eat here  times in the last  yearsevery time i try its closed  like today a random march friday  pm  it was closed  do they take a lot of vacations  ive heard good things though|they do great quality work the only reason i did not give them five stars is for their lack of customer courtesy not once but twice i am a very patient and understanding person but being rude twice means you dont want my business and i tipped |it wasnt a busy night at the neighborhood but you could have been fooled by how long the food took  while it did take a while everyone was extremely friendly  the food did come out hot at least mine did the rest of the plates were platewarmer hot  everyone in the table resented me for holding back the table since they staff pointed out they were waiting on my burgerwhich hey works as a segway onto the burger  quesadilla burger  i knew that was a mistake but i did it anyways  the patty was sorta flavorful  the toppings were in the bland category  cheese went mia  and the tortilla were overtoasted and tastelessa big blah overall which is sad since weve had a grand ole time and good food in past visits|applebees is a chain restaurant found around the country the service is friendly and now they have added to your table a machine where you can play games answer trivia questions or add to your order there is a slight fee for the two former items so you would swipe your card in order to use iti normally come here during the week when they have lunch specials you get a choice or soup half sandwich or half salad of the ones listedi normally order the french onion soup along with the chinese chicken salad although it comes fried you can request it grilled and you get a small breadstick to go with itit is a smaller portion than regular size for the same items but since i dont eat a whole lot i find it to be enough food is okay prices are reasonablethey have another option when you come at other times for a  party sharing meal which is listed on the menu on this particular visit i noticed a young boy was celebrating a birthday so a group of waiters came gave him a small dessert and sang to him desserts are also reasonably priced but not overly bigi stop here when i want a change of pace and want to save a few dollars on a lunch|giant eagle is one of pittsburghs more expensive grocery chains i only shop here because it is convenient to where i live often times when im shopping for produce i find fruit that is overripe and sometimes find mold in themthe one i shop has a small market district area and is easy to get around they have a rewards program which is called an advantage card where for every  spent you get  off your purchase at their gas station called getgo you can accrue rewards but they expire after  months of non usethey have a floral section and is one of the few places i can find graveside flower arrangements for memorialsstill expect to pay more if you shop here selection at this particular location is average|called for an arrangement for pickup told the person who took my order that i would be able to pick the arrangement up at pm  she asked if i could get there any earlier i said i would try my best but i work until pm so maybe not  she said ok  comes to be pm and i get a call from a guy at the shop asking where i was  the lady who took my order wrote down that id be there at pm  i explained that i never said that and picked the arrangement up a little before pm  arrangement was just ok  i specifically wanted a lot of orange flowers which they did but they added strange colors with the orange and some of the flowers were already a little wilted  even though the location is convenient i will probably go elsewhere for a flower order next time|the order process went well and the delivery arrived in a timely manner i saw a picture of the flowers my friend received and the arrangement  wasnt even close to what was pictured on the websitea lot more filler flowers despite ordering the premium arrangement i picked this place specifically because of what they offered despite other cheaper places in the area i am disappointed because i wanted the best arrangement possible for my friend who is going through a tough time i will not order from this place again|meh ive ordered from here twice and not really been enthusiastic about the results either time keep in mind that i havent had pizza from this place yettheir steak hoagie is middlinggood nothing to write home about but a pretty good example of the standard pittsburgh pizza place steak hoagiethe seafood calzone is another story something in it was so bitter i couldnt quite eat it im wondering if it was the garlic or perhaps a leftover burnt taste from the oven whatever it was it was gross the shrimp werent that good either suffering as they did from that certain i taste like iodine flavorthe advantage to rb is that theyre open reasonably late given the location but the phone service is rather surly and it always takes them an hour plus to deliver which would be ok if i didnt live a block away normally id just walk and pick it up but just for you yelpers i subject myself to the vagaries of sitting on my rear end on the couch waiting for my food to arrive|the food was ok nothing to rave about but nothing to be to dissapointed about either i ordered a sandwich with extra meat and was highly dissapointed i called in to try and get it corrected the guy pretty much brushed me off telling me thats how the do it ill let you be the judge by the pic well after telling him that i was going to give negative review he said i was threating him and for me to write my review and hung on me i waited a few minutes let things simmer down called back and he did send over a free sandwich which was nice just wish he could have done that from the start overall its decent late night food at a reasonable price but honestly theres better options during normal operating hours|the food here is pretty good which is disappointing because the service is terrible about  of the times we have ordered from here they somehow managed to screw up the food tonight they screwed up  of the  items we ordered i dont know if the person taking the orders has hearing problems or is just being very careless but either way its very irritating getting food i didnt order even if its still good food|if you havent been to one of these heres the scoop  they will try to upsell you on everything telling you that x is recommended even when it most definitely is not and in fact could even be damaging  for example they told me my car was recommended for a tire rotation  my cars manual specifically states to not rotate as the tires are no the same  just get an oil change and thats it  on the plus side theyre really fast  last time i stopped in to subway for a  figuring i would have time to eat it in the car during the oil change  i only got  of it finished and im not exactly a slow eaterlastly always look online for a coupon  you can use your phone to google a coupon good for  off|i stopped by here this past tuesday in order to pick up a to go pizza  my fiance a friend and i were trying pizza from three different places and luigis was one of them  i have driven by luigis many times before and for some reason had never stopped in but that did allow it to come to mind whenever i was looking for a pizza place i had not yet tried in the bellevue area  whenever i called to place my order i was told that my pizza would be ready in about  minutes  i arrived closer to  minutes later and was immediately confused whenever i walked into the restaurant  you see there was a large dining room on the left that was full of people and i didnt immediately see the are where i would get my pizza from  finally after a few steps into the restaurant i noticed that the whole back area of the restaurant was where i needed to be and i made my way back there  my pizza was ready for me and i quickly paid and was leaving whenever the cashier told me stay out of trouble  i really hope that was a friendly sentiment and not one that was based upon my appearance or anything else  the pizza itself had a medium thick crust with a bland sauce which is weird since i could see a ton of green herbs in it  the cheese was just ok and nothing special while the pizza itself had a slightly sour taste to it which i did not enjoy  out of the three different pizzas we ate that night this one was overwhelmingly our least favorite which was evidenced by the fact that  of it was left after the eveningthe bottom line for me is that i will probably not head back to luigis in the future  i just dont see myself making a trip to luigis between the weird experience although not bad that i had in the restaurant and the fact that there are much better pizza places nearby|recently ive found myself patronizing bellevue a little more namely because ive bought a house in the area and have been checking out some of the mom and pops along the little strip of mayberry rfd that is the quaint main street luigis is one of those little mom and pops that offers standard basic italian in a comfortable setting its a little kitchy redwhiteandgreen with dino and frankie tunes playing in the backgroundive stopped in on several occasions now for dinner with various friends and the food has been consistentits goodsatisfying not overthetop gourmet or even in the remotest sense pretentious its just a good ol night out for some pasta or lasagna with a side salad garlic bread and conversation with your palsthe portions are ample the prices are reasonable the flavors wont knock your socks off and make you think youve died and gone to sicily but they wont make you cringe at having given your money to a profiteering chef boyardee either the service is decent kind of point blank not rude nor over the top friendly the crowd can fluctuate between oh my god im surrounded by hillbillies to the local gathering at mayberry but that seems to be the norm for most places in da burghive not had the pizza which apparently get raves because frankly i only think of pizza as coming in a box to my front door when im too lazy to do any cooking at home but ive had three or four of the pasta dishes and they come in a generous portion with a side salad and an order of garlic toast they taste fine fill you up and dont break your bankand for a local neighborhood joint thats exactly what id hope for a place you can go to find a dependable and reasonable meal on a semiregular basis in a comfortable setting with no frills or pretense and that is exactly what luigis is|the pizza was ok it is been the best my husband and i have had in this area they seem to be the most authentic compared to other pizza delivery shops in this area|i stop by here frequently when i am on my way to work for breakfast the drive thru is fast but they do tend to get the order wrong but i will say that i have had more free meals here due to them comping me for all messed up orders the staff is friendly|this is the place that is close to my house so i go here all the timethey are usually pretty good and they definitely got betterthe orders come out pretty fast and the employers are nice|we ordered from here because uncle chen our goto takeout place down the road was closed i ordered the general tso tofu a favorite dish of mine and hubby ordered the beef mei fun noodles we always grab some egg rolls too the lady on the phone wasnt rude per se but she wasnt exactly helpful or answering any of my questions either hubby wanted to see about getting a different sauce on his noodles and i had to ask a few times before she finally answered my question about how large the tofu dish was i was in a good mood though so the attitude over the phone didnt bother me price was good typical takeout rates the good news is that they will allow you to pay with credit cards over the phone so if youre like me and never carry cash you can still get delivery she told me  minutes for the foodthe food arrived in about  minutes we live half a mile away it was hot and smelled great hubbys mei fun looked typical but he was saddened to see that they didnt exchange the white sauce for brown sauce the beef was pretty mushy and didnt taste all that great the veggies were fresh and pretty crispy even after soaking in sauce noodles were alright nothing to write home about my general tso tofu was delicious and tasted exactly like the dish i was craving fried to perfection perfectsized pieces of tofu and a fantastic sauce the broccoli was fresh and tasted good this particular dish only came in one size enormous i think hubby and i just ended up sharing my meal paired with some mediocre egg rollsso long story short lady on the phone was a bit irritating delivery was fast food was fresh and depending on what you order the food quality ranges from soso to great if youre looking for a quick fix to your chinese food craving this is a good place to order from although ill be going back to uncle chen before i try china sea again|as with all of the fast food restaurants in this area of ohio river blvd this place is dumpy and dirty  the staff is also poorly supervised and ive been privvy to more store gossip drama and horseplay than ive ever experienced in any restaurant fast food or otherwise  they get so loud back in the kitchen that we will often stop our conversation in the dinning room to wait for them to quiet down a bit before we continue  the food itself is generally passable|my mom was up from mississippi for thanksgiving and claimed to be in dire need of a manicure i wanted to try somewhere in my new hood brighton heights so i turned to trusty yelp for advice off to star nails we went the inside was bright and tidy the pedicure stations looked clean and newer and the ladies were friendly unfortunately the good feelings didnt last long we each picked a color and went to our respective technicians the technician doing my nails as very nice and talkative but just very inattentive to detail i got no handarm massage minimal shaping and the polish application was exceptionally sloppy and thick her attempts to clean up the polish all over my cuticles were futile their actual technique was strange too as both technicians had us dry our nails after the first coat was applied my mom and i left and almost in unison declared it to be the worst manicure weve gotten at least the price wasnt exorbitant   tip each perhaps their other services are better but ill be giving the other nail shops in the area a chance next time|we stopped through the drive thru last night after helping my sister move it was midnight and thankfully something was open i ordered nuggets fries and a frosty my sister ordered the same and bobby ordered two jr bacon cheeseburgers well only one burger was in the bag we found out halfway down the road bobby said the other burger was dry and they forgot the mayo  my sisters fries had no salt on them lso she says mine were fine but i kept that to myself to avoid her eating some of mine typical older siblinganyways i dont normally review fast food that ive had bad experience at bc it happens often but totally forgetting a burger is not cool|i was in need of a pedicure before my beach vacation so i decided to stop in to star nails in bellevue ive never had a pedicure before mostly because im superticklish but i felt like it was about timethe salon looks quite nice inside wood well laminate floors clean decor and four pedicure chairs up on the platform on the right i didnt have an appointment and waited about ten minutes on a wednesday eveningnancy was my nail technician and she greeted me warmly and helped me over into the pedicure area pro tip dont wear a pastkneelength skirt as it can make straddling the foot bath to get into the chair slightly awkward nancy helped me out like a pro and i was all setthe pedicure chairs have a massage feature that reminded me of the migun massage tables they dont just vibrate they knead the controller is right next to you so you can stop and start as you like i just made sure the thing kept running the whole time the foot bath was nice and warm id brought a book to keep myself busy but turns out all my attention was occupied by relaxingnancy guided me through the steps and the slight language barrier isnt much of a problem she completely understood that i was superticklish from the flinching involved and somehow managed to be very careful about it it wasnt at all unpleasant which is what id kind of expectedthis is the awful tmi section so avert your ayes if you are at all sensitive since ive never had a pedicure and i tend to walk around either barefoot or in thinsoled shoes i had quite a lot of callus built up the removal was kind of disgusting so i just didnt look but it didnt hurt at all i also tend to ingrown toenails on both big toes and she dealt with them gently and quickly i was a bit concerned about having that done at a salon but its a week later and my toes havent turned gangrene so alls well that ends wellend tmieven though it wasnt the spa pedicure not sure what else that involves i got a full foot and calf massage polish on and all done at which point i thought i might as well get a manicure toothe manicure involved heated mitts and a hand massage and was very nice total cost was  plus tip i gave her  for having to deal with my nasty feet i had some fun conversations with other patrons and overall a great experience id go back once a day if it were in any way reasonable to do so but this is getting placed on the onceamonth schedule for surethe polish from the pedicure is still holding up like a champ after a week the manicure was pretty well shot after a couple of days so ill probably just stick with doing the polish at home although i cant complain about the massage and cuticle careagain i dont have other salons or spas to compare with but it seemed like a good basic service with a few little extras the staff were all friendly and remembered the repeat customers who came in they do take credit cards and you can put the tip on the card as well i brought cash for that as i am not used to salons taking tips on cardsthey also offer acrylics which i dont do gel nails which id like to try and nail art im not sure if they do waxing i am sure that its a friendly place that its clean important and that they made me feel relaxed even though i was beyond nervous going in|lincoln bakery is yet another local bakery ive been meaning to try  when a google offer came up i took it so i would have no excuse to keep avoiding it  the place has a nice neighborhood bakery feel as i took in the many selections it seemed that everyone who came in was a regular  there werent many people when i was there it was still relatively early but i got the impression that at times there can be a line to the door  one thing that i didnt like was although they had many pastries to choose from nothing was labeled  so i had to keep asking what things were  the cinnamon roll was okay nothing spectacular  but the pastries i got were very good  id recommend checking it out  i know if im ever in the neighborhood i will stop in for a treat myself|cookies arent bad  havent had a reason to buy cakes or other pastries  staff is friendly and it smells like heaven|the couple that owns and operates metro motors were in a word rude  he was especially rude to my  year old soncar was decent but overpriced and the advertised mileage wasnt correct|everytime i eat at this location i end up with a sick stomach  i dont have that problem at other arbys  the dining area is clean and everything else seems ok but i always get a sick stomach  maybe they should relook at their food prep|arbys is definitely king of the fast food joints on the blvd  for that id give it five stars  however its still fast food which explains the mediocre rating  do not go here without a coupon from the sunday papertheres a whole page of them at least once a month  the staff here is very nice and very fast and on the whole the food is better than elsewhere by the river if youre stuck with a fast food choice|kuhns is cheaper than the large giant eagle two miles away but there isnt a lot of variety and you wont find any specialty items   the deli and meat selection is good and cheapnearly half the price of the big bird  you can find most staple items here and they always double coupons  the produce aisle is humiliatingly sad  there is no bakery but they do have fresh mancinis bread in the mornings  a major annoyance is that you must pay cash for stamps and bus passes|like time traveling back to the sixties this store barely meets the basics small dingy dated and very limited in selectionbut at least its convenient and walkable for those in the surrounding area dont go looking for really fresh or exotic produce the produce section is tiny and mostly prepackaged meat section also limited the deli section is small but friendly and efficientagain it carries the basicscheckout can be slow if youre in the middle of making dinner or baking and need a quick missing ingredient this is the place for a quick stop as long as you can use the express lane  otherwise its worth the trip to trader joes whole foods walmart or even giant eagle basic is okay and so is this kuhns|so i came to this red white and blue with high hopes of thrift store mecca and i will get to how i left empty handed and in tears  first ill walk you through my experience  this place is pretty large and relatively clean with a nice parking lot  the racks are packed with clothes  and i mean hard to move the hangers because there is so much stock which can be a pro or a con depending on how you like it  i found it a bit cumbersome since although the clothes are organized by type dress vs blouse there is no size separation  in a place this huge it takes quite a long time to find what youre looking for without the size separation  but im not one to abandon a bargain because i dont want to look around after all that is what its all about so i gave a good  min and got a handful of garments to try on  i would typically spend a few hours but i was trying to spare a friend not as keen on secondhand garments  with my carefully extracted finds i searched in vain for a fitting room never to find one  after asking the staff where it was i had to take a seat and leave my jaw dropped for a while because there is no fitting room i couldnt take this fact into my brain and although there were some household items i wanted to go back and buy i was too upset to continue  sidenote yes i can understand how this can work for the rwb but imho it is unforgivable and i wish there was at least some warning before spending my time searching for a bargain when i couldnt even see if it would fit i would recommend this store if you are looking for something specific secondhand especially for dishes or older electronics or even beauty products  there was even a used nikon slr with a wide angle lens  though  but if you plan on buying a sundress and dont plan on stripping down in front of your fellow thrifties youd better be confident in your purchase  rwb is just like any other thrift store and you cant return or exchange your items so youd be out of luck and out of money|my beef was so raw that i had to put it in the microwave for two minutes it was even slightly cold before i reheated it the manager says they cook it medium rare and i explained it was so rare it ate the lettuce off of the sandwich neither the brown sugar bacon and beef nor the blt had much bacon how do i post pictures for a sandwich advertised to have delicious bacon this fell way short the little bit of bacon it did have was burnt really arbys i told the manager i have no idea how they thought sending out a sandwich like that was acceptableoverall this made a horrible day worse i was celebrating my two oldest girls graduation from high school and what was supposed to be a very nice dinner was a disaster we went to arbys as a back up so i had at least a little something to eat that was equally disastrous at least the fries were okay albeit a little soft and mushy for some reason based on this experience i would not go back based on this experience i would most definitely not recommend this to others|prices not great for true thrifters staff completely useless no dressing rooms i simply have nothing to say about this place|nice and clean with well organized large selection but was expensive i was looking for some twin size thin cotton blankets easy to wash and hang dry for my dog and the prices were  of course somewere high quality items which u would have to pay new retail store price  but still overpriced i finally found a small blanket for  on sale|this is one of my favorite thrift stores in the burg  everything is well organized and the checkout lines go fast  i always see plenty of staff members which are always working hard  when i have a goal of something i am looking for  this store always has it  cash only  no credit cards but atm is on site  the mention of no fitting rooms often peppered throughout some reviews   i am not one that tries on clothes so that doesnt bother me  i just wing it and it always works outthe ample space for parking is no doubt a bonus  its easy to get in and out via route |the homecooked breakfasts at the rusty nail in bellevue are wonderful prices are reasonable the wait staff are gems and is often bragged about by bellevue locals  that said two stars is all i can muster primarily due to the tiny cramped dining area  ive witness people at three tables being disrupted while they are eating so departing diners would have enough room to push their chair away from the table and pass by others just to leavedont get me wrong i adore that pittsburgh is a small friendly city but im not fond of getting elbowed in the back as the guy behind me cuts his breakfast steak and eggs nor knowing his guest gargled with cool mint listerine this morning or worse didnt   yes the tables are packed that close together  and whatever you do dont dare bring a large friend here to dine when its busy unless you enjoy feeling like a complete jag off for doing so on the way out|the sunday brunches serve great pancakes and i always felt so fancy eating here as a kid  note that if you wait until the churches let out to get in line that there will be a long queue outside  the rest of the menu ranges from decent to average but the food is always cheap  the tables are so close together it feels like youre crawling over your neighbors to be seated  on nicer summer days and during any of the bellevue events they often serve fresh lemonade or iced tea outside|i really wanted to like the rusty nail  i love little local restaurants like this  but it really is a very tight squeeze to begin with  they really need to pull some tables out of there to make more room  we were right on top of another table with two very loud young children and there was just no buffer  and the food was just so bland  i get that it was supposed to be homestyle cooking but it just had no flavor  to be fair we did go for dinner and i understand that this place is more of a breakfast joint so i would be willing to try it again sometime for breakfast  for dinner though unless you like superbland food i probably wouldnt return for seconds|given that the rusty nail has been highly recommended to me as a good breakfast spot by various sources im sad to say i was sorely disappointed they have a wide selection of breakfast options  however even with numerous breakfast specials listed not one included eggs meat potatoes and toast  yes thats right  i had to order the eggs bacon and toast special with a side of the potatoes  when my food was served the portions were average except for the side order of potatoes  i did greatly enjoy the potatoes though which i ordered deep fried  my dining companion ordered the french toast with ham and enjoyed it very much  we were here on a weekday morning so we didnt have to worry about it being crowded  the service was good  and its not that i thought anything was bad its just that as the two star rating says meh ive experienced better  given the plethora of choices in bellevue this will not be my first stop should i find myself on lincoln avenue for breakfast again|a great pittsburgh diner with friendly service and good diner food if there are any problems the prices a bit high for diner food and as others have said its extremely cramped otherwise its an enjoyable place to eat and the food is indeed very good|i am very happy to be moving into a neighborhood that has a lineup of decent momandpop shops to find a reasonable meal when the cupboard is bare or the energy banks are depleted for cooking bellevue does seem to have a small collection of decent eats at reasonable prices and the rusty nail is one of that handful of good examples of neighborhood hauntsits touted as a diner in many of the reviews but it really is a step above your average diner and is more of a cozy neighborhood gathering spot for a decent burger or entree ive not made it there for the breakfast but have always been satisfied by the dinnersrusty nail is hardly on the gourmet end of the scale in fact i would imagine the sysco truck pulls up out back regularly with deliveries of food parts from cans of sauces to frozen animal chunks as long as those parts are assembled and doctored to make them seem a bit fresher than the typical conveyorbelt diner all is fine and indeed all is fineso few of our local diners are up to snuff when it comes to serving up decent diner fare that i cant call rusty nail a diner its a neighborhood family restaurant periodburgers meatloaf pot roast fish sammiches salads pastasa varied but adequate menu fair and decent prices friendly and attentive service a cozy enough atmosphere although i have to say again in a review of a restaurant if youve got multiple tvs in the space for gods sake can one of them not be showing sports coverage and a pleasant crowd of patrons during my last visit there was a large family gathering at the next table a nicely polished middleclass clan ranging in age from gramps to granddaughter at one point dad received a phone call on his celland actually stepped outside to have his conversation as i was leaving i had to pat him on the back and thank him for being one of the few remaining decent guys with mannersbottom linerusty nail is comfortable its not a driveoutofyouway destination for dining it is what it is a great little neighborhood spot for the neighborhood but do bring cash the dont take credit cards believe it or not they will actually take a check|checked out the neighborhood restaurant for sunday brunch the portions were generous and the omelets were very good we felt that much of the food eg sides and service were just average for example we typically had to ask for coffee to be refilled it is a great place to go for a quick bite to eat on a sunday morning but i would not make a special trip to the restaurant|first time here and i wasnt impressed at all  i should have gone to the dairy queen |i stopped by here on my way home from whole foods market they had just paved there parking lot which can only fit  max cars at a time it was not as big as the one i normally shop at in penn hills they are a beer distributor and have a way hugger selection but they serve all of penn hills so go figurei was looking for a gluten free beer which they had four kinds including cider the prices were crazy expensive  for a  pack of cider no way i had to buy it though cause it was sunday at  and all the stores close at  so i had no choice i should have waited but i drove all the way here to get it so i should just buy it while im there aside from the money issue this place was just ok to me|not a fan ive been here twice in the past six months and both times the person working was rude and unfriendly it might have been the same worker both times tonight we walked in and went up to the counter with our beer the guy looked at us for a second then continued doing whatever he was doing behind the glass im not sure what we were not acknowledged at all and we waited some more we finally had to ask if we could pay for our beer he looked up from what he was doing and said ummm yeahhh then finally came over no apology no greeting as soon as we paid he slid the glass door closed again no thank you or have a good day there were still two hours before they closed so its not like we came when they were trying to close we left wondering what just happened it was a weird experience ill continue to look for a different distributor which sucks because its so close to me but id rather spend my money somewhere else i gave it two stars instead of one because they do have a good selection of cases of beer if you want more than just a sixpack|a decent italian restaurant serving delicious fresh made bread with hummus flat breads salads soups and pasta outdoor seating is available in nice weather and the service is friendly overall not a bad place but not super exciting either  pinos suffers from its close proximity to the excellent  point brugge cafe it also gets quite noisy inside so its hard to carry on a conversation and seems to attract a somewhat older crowd of people|i made it back here about two weeks ago  i must say the experience was night and day compared to the one at the end of july  whether or not it was an off night i do not know but the place was loud and crowded the service was bad and the food was mediocre at best  i should have just waited it out at point brugge  i wont becoming back anytime soon|i often have lunch at the nearby point brugge cafe but i decided to give pinos a try today for a change of pace  bad idea  my lady friend and i started with a pair of appetizers greens  beans and italian frites  the latter which the menu described as fresh cut twice cooked fresh herbs  roasted garlic were basically just regularass french fries  decent but nowhere near worth their  price tag  the greens and beans were even more of a ripoff  freakin dollars for a smallish bowl of rather flavorless produce  talk about a profit marginas a main course we shared a flatbread with goat cheese caramelized onions and roasted red pepper  it was pretty good but my enjoyment was diminished by the fm radio that was blaring through the loudspeakers  who wants to hear car commercials while eating a meal at a nice restaurant  classlessconclusion id rather wait  minutes for a table at point brugge than be seated immediately at pinos|pinos appears to fashion itself something of a nouveauitalian smart casual neighborhood restaurant and its literally just that translation the menu is uninspired and predictable a relatively encompassing selection of appetizers and entrees revealed not quite a soulcrushing but certainly a lackadaisical attitude toward ingredients recipes and presentation though the service was refreshingly excellent unfortunately the only other reason youd be dining in point breeze would be to enjoy the amazing point brugge cafe just down the street as a previous reviewer mentioned i stopped in simply because the brugge was full but i unfortunately wont be making that mistake again|i always see this place and saturday we decided to stop in for lunch the atmosphere was pleasant my boyfriend had the buffalo chicken sandwich which he loved i however ordered the steak and cheese pita and was extremely disappointed the pita was soft and fresh but the steak was terrible it was very steakum like and saturated with grease when i picked up the sandwich grease poured from it im not one to send back food and thats my fault but the waitress came by once as i was eating over heard me upset about my food looked at me then continued on her way needless to say i dont think i will be returning|tasty option for sunday brunch ive read the reviews and what seems to ring true is that pinos has a good sunday brunch thankfully thats when me and my gang decided to check out this little lovely brunch menu has both traditional brunch fair and some italian twists my mum had challah french toast and loved it pops had their breakfast risotto with a fried egg on top  i tried that and it had a nice kick to itother folks at the table had the eggs benedict salad and sammy over all everyone was happy and it was only half full so easy to talk and hang out and for the music complainer you whining stinker we had a nice ipod mix on when we were there|i have had lunch at pinoss several times probably at least  times usually i am there  for a business lunch when i am in the area i find that we are well served not rushed and the noise level is not too loud at lunch we have several times asked the chef to make us some special version of his menu and we are always accommodated to me this is excellent service makes you feel like coming backi would have to admit that i usually order the garlic fries which are really great i do this if i am not going back to the office or out to meet a clientnormally i would add a soup of the day which are always nice and a sandwich of the day i have never been disappointed and certainly would continue to conduct business lunches here pinos has been very reliable and dependable in all aspects  i would make it   stars|i grew up just the street from pinos and my family were probably its most regular customers  we got takeout at least once or twice a week for many many years and always enjoyed the pizza and hot subs ive just been back for the first time in  years after moving away and was pretty unimpressed the decor looks nice but the food was wayyyyy overpriced for what it was  dollars for a plate of pasta really it claimed to be fresh pasta but it was completely tough and chewy not al dente just undercooked and not very large im not sure when the restaurant changed but i think it really missed the mark people want a casual friendly affordable neighborhood place that they can bring the kids to why take that away|i struggle with this review i wish i could give it a  but i really cant hate on it like everyone else their wait staff has always been super attentive and friendly and their happy hours are great but a lot of their entrees are a little meh for me especially for the price stick to happy hour for winecheese platters and enjoy a nice summer evening here|went here with a gift card from the restaurant week photo competition we were one of two tables there and a bunch of staff showing up during the meal our waitress was good but that couldnt save the foodthe meal started out with some what i guess used to be foccacia  i say used to be because it no longer represented anything other than long pieces of brick or bark very stale and tastelesswe ordered the vegetable board which was probably the best thing we ordered with light and bright vegetables perfectly cooked and paired with two delicious sauces then we ordered the octopus which was fine but very cold and the octopus had little to no flavor being overwhelmed by the citrus in the dish the tuscan wings were ok but they were really ordered for my husband who seemed to enjoy them finally the diver scallops  this dish was indeible  the scallops were very overcooked and the pea puree was so minty i was unable to eat it we sent it back and they did take off half of the price werent expecting anything just didnt want to eat it after that we decided against dessert and left  i probably will not return|my husband and i celebrated our one year wedding anniversary this past weekend and since we recently have moved into a new area of town we made reservations here because word on the street was that it was good verdict it was soso we had reservations at  and were seated promptly which was fine except we were seated outside listen folks its cold when the sun goes down they have three tables set outside i guess trying to squeeze out some more business our server was nice but not attentive at all  we were left waiting for things for  minutes at a time also because we were sitting on the sidewalk people and animals and cars kept sweeping by us it took the waiter three tries to get our meal order because he had to keep stepping out of the way of people walking down the street wine was good food was ehhhhhh we had the mussel and clam appetizer and when it came out about  of the order was not edible and all the innards had fallen into the sauce which by the way smelled like stinky cheese my dinner and my husbands dinner was good no real complaints there espresso and a smore cupcake for dessert and i grand total of  later before tip definitely not worth it at all  the best part of the night leaving the worst part of the night associating this place with my anniversary|nice atmosphere with above average food this restaurant has a lot of potential the wait staff was far below average they were slow and we had to ask multiple times for things they were not the most polite wait staff and our waitress was either a little demeaning or very socially awkward|we were huge fans of pinos a few years back before the wine bar concept was adopted in all honesty we havent been back for a year though we kept saying  we have to get to pinos needless to say we were disappointed  the place has changed and not for the better  it seems in an effort to create a quaint wine bar pinos lost sight of the original draw and that was the food  the menu has been scaled back considerably  though the food was adequate its not the same  i came here because the food was amazing and with that no longer being the case i doubt we will return  hopefully things will change back to how they were  customer advice for what its worth  refocus on great italian food not a wine bar concept   sometimes a liquor license is not the best investment|small portions over priced food very small menu dinner was ok but disappointing overall|pinos offers an unhappy marriage of good food at bad prices  the food is tasty but not transcendent  the prices in the high s for most of the entrees are not justified by the quality location or portions  the food is essentially slightly hipper olive garden fare at double the pricesfor dinner entrees you can get more for your money elsewhere  but its not all bad  the atmosphere is pleasant and the service was excellent  i had a good time and id happily go back for appetizers most are pinos is frequented by a large rambunctious flock of malbec massacring  year old women  my friend and i were the only males there  if cougar hunting is your sport of choice youll feel right at home in pinos jungle safari|pinos is an midlevel italian place with a charming neighborhood atmosphere the prices arent the cheapest but for what it is pinos delivers small plates and dinners that are satisfying without breaking the bank the lamb bolognese is one of my personal favorites as well as pretty much any of the appetizers i also love the creative cocktail list and the half price bottles of wine for happy hour there are few places in pittsburgh that can get me as excited about cocktails as pinos my roommate and i have come here with friends and sat at the bar for hours eating and drinking a variety of delightful things in short they do drinks and food quite well for the price the reason pinos only gets three stars is the unfortunate inconsistency with service ive encountered i get treated differently depending on who i come in with and thats unprofessional if im with my roommate and one of my friends both of whom work nearby we all get seated quickly and treated extremely well in short it feels like my presence is valued when ive come to pinos with people who arent in with the owners though ive had a thoroughly lackluster experience once i came on my birthday with my boyfriend and frankly was let down we waited awkwardly for a very long time to be seated even though there were empty tables and in general had a very impersonal experience i felt embarrassed having spoken so highly of pinos to him beforehand i know ill be back for the occasional happy hour or small dinner but pinos isnt somewhere i would take anyone i wanted to impress due to the problematic service|some nice wine and good appetizers  the main courses are quite pricey|we have had dinner there before and enjoyed it  my sister and niece were in for the weekend so we decided to go again as we hadnt been for awhile  service was lack luster and slow  they charged us for a salad we ordered but was never delivered they werent full when we got there but they did fill up  we probably waited  minutes for our entrees  our meals were mixed  the flat bread pizzas which we had for appetizers were good  several of us had the seafood pasta  it said it was a cream sauce but it was pretty watery the shrimp and lobster was tough and i suspect frozen hell i can cook frozen food at home  the scallops were tiny  generally underwhelming  other dinners were better we had a party of  and they added a  tip  i understand why restaurants do this but i dont like it  i tip  for adequate service but since when do you tip on the tax too  we wont be back anytime soon|the food was good the pasta is made fresh the ambiance wasnt very cozy even though you are packed together and the tables are small it really didnt match the menu which is primarily italian our server was busy when we first got there so we waited patiently however as the dinner went on and it was only us and  other tables she didnt clean off the table once refill our drinks got an order wrong it drives me nuts when servers dont write orders down on paper again the food was delicious but everything else didnt fit|these guys do everything by the booki had lapsed in my pendot stickers and registration and they helped me get that together they wont work on your car if its registration isnt validthey told me my  toyota would need new wipers to pass safety inspection they had me but the cost was reasonable|this giant eagle truly is giant  and believe me thats about all it has going for it  you would think that this means you can find what you want and generally you can but it also means enormous crowds no matter when you shop hereyou know that a trip to a large one size fits all chain grocery store like this is not quite the same as shopping at macys or boscovs  you know that its pretty hard to give a place like this five stars  its purpose is purely utilitarian  but good gravy youd think that a place like this could handle large crowds  it shouldnt take you a halfhour just to get one item  thats what happened to me yesterday  i would have been better off going to cogos or   i might have paid a bit more but i would have been inandout in under five minutes  i prefer the giant eagle in squirrel hill|i have to agree that this is one of the poor examples that giant eagle has  granted it has the basics you need and is  of the biggest in the city itself  finding things takes work  my big gripe is that it has one of the weirdest and most illogical layouts that ive seen  it actually takes time to find what you need as compared to most stores where once you are in there a few times you easily find everything  parts of this store are diagonal and that causes you to go in every direction possible  here is a quick summary of the setup as it can be classified as a maze when you enter the store through the slow wide door you go to the left and walk past the front registers to produce  normal enough from produce in front of you a quasi lshaped department you take a quick left and go diagonally to the right to walk past the pharmacy  take a hard right down aisle  and then you hit the bakery     from the bakery you walk along a long meat wall  diagonally to the left youll find the service meatseafood counters and because how the wall goes diagonal to the left the sign for aisle  is facing diagonally to the right so you dont miss it because the  side is longer towards the back than the other aisles  are almost twice as long as  from meat you have frozen straight back on a long back wall in its own cove  a hard right if you bypass frozen brings you last to hot foods the deli and then facing in front of you the customer service desk which is tucked away in a corner not really visible when you walk in the store once you pass the deli and customer service take a hard right then to the left almost a uturn to the checkouts and then you take a hard left to leavemost of the other giant eagle stores are much more logical in how their aisles and deparment locations are set up   youre not going every which way to try and find thingsalso the service isnt that great as one of the other reviews said  given that i would take market district on centre ave or ge on murray ave over this storehowever for those who remember the giant eagle on centre ave at n craig st nothing beats how bad that store was  there is a reason that store was nicknamed the dirty bird  compared to that north oakland store that closed several years ago shakespeare st ge is light years ahead|i cannot in my life understand why this giant eagle of all the giant eagles would get a five star rating  from the moment you walk into here its like someone has hit you on the head very hard and you walk around in a confused state the rest of the time youre in therethe set up is ridiculous  i mean who wants to walk around in the freezer section and then go through a smaller than usual end of the aisle to see surprise the meat section hidden off in an area where they could have knocked down the wall so you didnt have to do a little dance to get to it  aisles seem extra long in this store you can tell that they worked with the space they had  its like when you are half way through the aisle and realize its too late to turn around because its the same distance to the end as it was to the beginning of the aisle but you kind of just want to give up and sit on the floor because you feel like youve been walking forever  honestly i only went here because i was at target and didnt want to venture any further to complete my shopping|i prefer this store to the market district on centre its just as overpriced and poorly laid out and maybe a bit grimy but carries less products to sift through when you just need to grab some simple things hopefully not produce parking is easy and you can hit up the unpretentious wine and spirits in the same stop i think this plaza still exists to prevent impoverished people from venturing into the other newer fancier stores which are a mere half mile away and designed to appeal to people who think they are cultured and discerning|i agree with other reviews this store is poorly laid out and honestly makes no sense sometimes bigger is not always better i used to head here often while living near shadyside to stop at the family dollar  hit ge in one run i normally only stopped here for a redbox movie my debit card got hacked at an outdoor redbox at a get go so ill only go to a redbox that is indoor like this one anyways id hit up the liquor store for some wine afterwards for dealing with long lineswait  awkward clientele outside|ugh dirty long lines walked out without making purchase |as a petite young white female im fearful to go here alone i choose this giant eagle most of the time over the big market district one on center avenue because its easier to find a place to park and you can run in and grab what you need quickly however i feel like i walk around with my purse clutched tightly to my side and have to watch my back the clientele that hang outshop here is not the greatest there is a police officer that sits at the front of the building which is good that makes me feel a bit better most cashiers are friendly and nice some are very slow the shift supervisor that hangs out around the cash registers is extremely unfriendly and often shows little disregard for her job her employees and customers more than once she has yelled at me to move faster when using the self checkout and when my self checkout lane has needed the assistance of an employee because it wasnt working she makes sure you know youve bothered her from what she was doing i cant wait to return to this giant eagle so i can get her name and post it on my yelp review hopefully someone will get her some customer service training or etiquette classes|im not sure why this place has bad reviews its par for thecourse for supercuts standard cut  is a bit pricy but they always do exactly what i say ive simple hair so it works well for me employees are generally nice sometimes like talking to me sometimes talk just to each other worth three stars for sure|nothing spectacular but i go there regularly and generally get a cut that works fine for at least a couple of months  they did a good job after i had a botched cut overseas hairdressers in japan are understandably not necessarily qualified to work on nonasian hair as they dont cut a lot of it parking can be tough depending on time of daytheres a shared private lot but its small|went here with a friend for his haircut its been a long time since ive been to a barber shop or haircut salonstore but from what i remember this place seems completely average the hair stylists seem nice enough and competent the wait was a few minutes i actually expected the wait to be longer because we came in on a saturday if i ever need a haircut which i havent gotten in maybe  years i wouldnt have a problem stopping in here but i tend to enjoy my long shaggy mop|i used to cut my own hair haphazardly with a pair of andis clippers  once due to a series of unfortunate events i ended up needing a new passport photo the day i cut my hair  i hadnt realized quite how much of a goob i looked like  since i was going from free to paying for haircuts i chose a supercuts and it was better than i did for myselfperiodically im burned by a supercut but what ive learned is that if you know what you want and tell the cutter how to do it things generally turn out alright and ive been going to this location since i moved to pittsburgh and have never had a bad experiencethe supercuts i used to go to in boston was renovated with a spafeel  mostly that meant new seating and heatedmassage chairs at the sinks where they do shampoos  not the case in shadyside  its in a stripmall and everything is kind of dated  the only spa treatment they have is the tea tree experience you get a bit of a hot towel face massage and special tingly tea tree shampoo  some of the cutters will spend several minutes on this while others finish so fast it seems like they have an aversion to scalpcontact  its hit or miss in terms of the amount of time they spend but for  thats a risk im willing to take  of course you can do the same for yourself with a little dr bronners but after letting someone operate sharp machinery near my face sometimes i want to be pampered just a bitso far while some have been better than others ive never had an embarrassing cut at this location and if youre a dude with short hair you can be in and out during your lunch break at work for  or about  if you dont want the shampoo|decent neighborhood pizza can be found in morningside at eddies pizza haus the sauce and cheese are perfect but the crust falls short  it has a nice texture and overall the pizza isnt greasy but the crust lacks much flavor maybe a little more salt is needed in the dough to compensate the pizza is decent enough though and merits a try perhaps it was an off day for eddies|pretty solid chinese takeout  they have a  minimum on campus food and delivered in less time than expected  the szechuan eggplant was not spicy at all but it did have a nice assortment of mixed vegetables broccoli zucchini corn carrots etc  the vegetable egg rolls seemed pretty tough  i dont know that i would order them againoverall im pretty pleased  i already like this place  even the big neon sign that just says tasty on the storefront   this is how im going to refer to it  ie do you want some takeout from tasty  i also love that one of their lunch menu options is fried rice soup  an egg roll for   i will almost definitely order from here again|food there are countless options to choose from for vegetarians or carnivores but the food is only soso  weve ordered takeout numerous times due to proximity and nothing has been bad but nothing has been special  the general tsos tofu and the moo shu vegetables are the best things weve ordered  the eggplant was soggy and not great  the portions are large  nothing is particularly spicy even if it is mentioned as being spicy on the menuprice tasty is cheap  drinks naatmosphere typical chinese takeout place  a photo of every single meal they offer is on the wall  located in the plaza next to pizza parma  decent location for that end of shadysideservice the employees speak poor english but can usually understand what you are askingttelling them  the food is usually ready for takeout within  minutes many options cheap ready quickly food is nothing to write home aboutwould i go back again if im feeling too lazybroke to go anywhere else|this place features everything you can expect from a standard holeinawall chinese restaurant theres zero ambiance offers quick takeout and the service is rude i decided to give tasty a try because its conveniently located on highland avenue and has easy parkingi ordered the kung pao chicken and crab rangoon sadly they prepared kung pao beef instead its extremely disappointing to receive the wrong food its even more disappointing when the restaurant refuses to correct the order while it wasnt what i ordered the food was goodbut there is better chinese food out there|note tasty has a credit card minimum of  and has a parking lottasty is another standard chinese takeout place  it didnt blow my mind but overall it was good especially considering the price before i continue i will come out and say that all of the food was a little tough  the eggroll especiallyas was warned   and the rice had some dark spotsi assume it was from the bottom of the cooking vessel  however i will chalk some of it up to my mistake because i thought they closed a half hour later  than they did and consequently ordered about  minutes before they closed so tasty you get a pass on the riceanyhow i ordered a vegetable eggroll and general tsos tofuive learned to accept my guilty pleasure i ordered the general tsos extra spicy  it was not also the tofu was in very large chunks which has seemed to be my luck lately i want surface area and i dont want to have to figure out how to cut my food with chopsticks i will say though that the sauce was very tasty  enough to seal the deal for a future order at this placethe eggroll as i said was tough it tasted good but it was tough and small this probably wont be in my future order however with the  minimum i do need to order something else with my tofu i hope the soup is goodthe lady behind the counter was friendly and was decent on the phone and didnt once mention that they were closing so close to when i ordered portion size was good for the  it cost me ill definitely be able to make a lunch out of what is left|not tasty at all|im giving this place a solid  ive had better cheap chinese and ive had worse first off let me just say take out is probably the way to go our server was nearly impossible to understand and we drank water out of tiny styrofoam cups that we had to wait for her to refilli ordered the crab rangoon a shrimp springroll and chicken fried rice the rangoon was pretty good the springroll was just a clump of grease and the rice was good my friends ordered beef and broccoli an egg roll and general tsos they were not too impressed with their mealsas far as food this place seems to be pretty hit or miss the prices make it worth ordering take out or delivery but i wouldnt waste my time eating in here|went here last night for takeout since our normal place is currently renovating their kitchen we ordered fried dumplings which were just ok we also ordered some shrimp lo mein and general tsos chicken these were some of the best entrees that i have gotten from a takeout place the lo mein was perfectly cooked and was not greasy at all the shrimp were also cooked perfectly the general tsos may be some of my favorite i have ever gotten it wasnt spicy like i requested but the chicken was still crispy after having to drive it home and the sauce was very savory overall i probably will crave the food from here and will be back on a night when i do not mind driving to pick up|eating as i type first time ordering here crab rangoon  cooked to perfection downfall is there is barely anything stuffed inside you dont taste a thing biggest disappointmentfried rice  average its rice no sign of egg just a lot of onion not bad though general tsos  pretty good its spicy like i requested sauce was all at the bottom just needed a stir chicken was cooked nearly perfect some a little chewy but better than the normal weird and slimy chicken you get sauce is really good ordered via eat street and took about  mins to be delivered to bloomfield pretty fast id order again definitely wouldnt try the rangoon again and thats one of my favorite apps|slow service and average pizza  convenient to home depot|i had heard lots of good things about ventos unfortunately i did not get to experience these things the service was slow and lukewarm the pizza was expensive and not the same price in the restaurant as advertised on the website httpwwwventospizzacom also no credit or debit cards here  youre directed to the atm in the restaurant that charges a fee of    i ordered ahead and although i had to wait for my pizza when i got there i received it cold and it just was not that good  i also ordered provolone sticks which also did not taste good|this was one of the worst dinners out ive had in recent memory on the other hand i wasnt expecting much so i guess the place lived up to my expectations ive been trying to think of a good way to describe their food and the best i can come up with is as follows imagine a cafeteria pasta dinner you might have been served as a child away at summer camp and youll have a pretty good idea in other words the food is perfectly edible here but boring and nothing you would want to actually pay for there was nothing disgusting about it it was just extremely uninspiring to be fair i only tried the pasta bread salad soup and calamari so maybe they have amazing pizza here its possible although unlikely based on what ive seenon the upside the service was friendly enough and there were plenty of empty tables at prime dinner time if youre hungry youll definitely be full when you leave|i went to this place because i had a livingsocial voucher even with this voucher i feel like i paid too much money i think i could have had better food if i went over to the giant eagle across the street and heated up a lean cuisine i do have to wonder why the owners would put out the living social deal when what really would help business at the restaurant would be simply to improve the quality of the foodthe only positives i can give are that it isnt pretentious and the waiter provided very good service it was almost empty for a monday at  pm so if you are desperately starving not able to go to better restaurants nearby or heat up food from your local grocers freezer this might be a tolerable food option  again it is advisable to be desperately starving|based on some recent reviews it looks like the quality of food at minutellos has slipped a little bit  still as i mentioned before its a shadyside institution located in the basement of an apartment building  anyway the main reason to come to minutellos is for the pizza  my cousin and i did just that the other night when we were in the area  we did the whole build your own pizza thing ordering ours with pepperoni green peppers onions and mushrooms  good pizza even if the place is beginning to look a little dated|minutellos is going out of business last day of operation is sunday february  |just like with the getgo down the road the shell on baum is almost just as difficult to get in and out of particularly in high traffic and while the getgo has a great selection of food and beverages and even a redbox the shell doesnt compete on any level and the price of gas is higher my advice is to only go here in case of an emergency which was my case because i was  miles to empty|its clear that this business just does not have pride about where they are who they are they are here to make money its frustrating because they also dont particularly need to work hard there are not a lot of other gas stations in the area particularly ones that have car washes i come here to fill up for the week and by getting a car wash i save money on my gas they have me here for the savings the guy behind the counter claimed he wasnt hungover he just had too much benadryl its clear they have the perfect people to work at a gas station perhaps he shouldnt be here during the saturday morning rush however|i took my car to mikes auto body as its recommended by geico and is part of their easy claims and repair process  this was a big mistake  like many of the reviewers here i was initially told it would take a certain amount of time and then at the last minute on the day i was supposed to get my car back they told me it would be a few more days  their excuse  the headlamp that came in didnt have a bulb with it  seriously  since this was the geico rep telling me this i couldnt really argue but i dont know why geico keeps working with a business that repeatedly does this to its customersi got the car back in great condition cleaned on the outside and the console wiped down inside  all in all just alright  go here if youre not pressed for time and youve got geico otherwise shop around|animal rescue league is great but im very disappointed by their dog trainerbehaviorialist lacey i have a large papillon a throwback as my vet called him whose previous owners neglected and undersocialized him for the first two years of his life as a result he is now extremely fearful when taken outside the home and he becomes overstimulated and aggressive i brought him to one of arls saturday small dog classes but he freaked out and we were asked to leave lacey said shed be in contact to set up a private class she called a few days later and we arranged a private class for pm on a wednesday i made arrangements to leave work early to drive back into the city and get my pup some help its hard to anticipate exactly how much traffic there will be on fifth ave during rush hour so i wound up playing it overly safe and arriving  minutes early for our class after a few minutes lacey noticed us and came outside to tell me that she was running fifteen minutes behind i wasnt sure what to do because i couldnt really go anywhere with my craycray dog and there was too much traffic to go home and come back again so she said we could wait inside in a small hallway we went in to wait and naturally with all the smells and sounds my pup got a bit riled up but we waitedand waited and waited at pm i knocked on the door to the training room silence so i opened it nobody was there and the door to the outside was open i peeked out and there she was with the people and dog that had the lesson before me i waited for a moment hoping shed notice me and look at her watch or something but nopeso i took my dog and walked outside to my car she turned and looked at me but didnt acknowledge me in any way i went and sat in my car with my dog for a few minutes hoping the other folks their dog and lacey would wrap things up but no they just continued on at pm i knew i couldnt wait any longer because i had work i still needed to finish up that had to be done by pm i got out of my car and began walking towards lacey she just stared at me rather than saying were just finishing up or sorry i lost track of time or anything at all so i said were going to have to reschedule its past  now and i cant stay past  she simply replied okay ill call you i thought it was rude and unprofessional to not offer any type of apology or even a halfhearted explanation but whatever no one said she had people skills i suppose and this was about getting my dog help well its been a week and a half no call from lacey needless to say ill be finding another more reliable trainer im just really disappointed not only in her unprofessionalism but also her lack of caring about my dog i barely had any interaction with lacey but even if there was something about me she didnt like she should have cared more about helping a pup that obviously needs it i sincerely hope that others have had better experiences and i hate to knock even a single star off for arl  but this yelp review seems to be my only way of warning others to seek another trainer for their dog behavioral needs |our cat recently came down with some health issues that we could not afford to address he was in pain and we decided the humane thing was to put him to sleep we went to the arl and asked the receptionist there if we had any other options available to us well basically the only thing you can do is sign him over for euthanasia she said in the most uncaring apathetic voice possible we were heartbroken of course go wait by that door and someone will meet you after a few minutes another woman came out and took the carrier ill bring your carrier back out in a minute we said no thats okay keep the carrier she said okay and took our cat to the back and that was it no kind words no sympathetic gestures no would you like a moment before i take him no im sorry nothing for us this was one of the worst days of our lives but nobody at the arl seemed to care or at least have been trained to pretend to care one bit they get a couple stars for offering a necessary service but other than that this place will only be associated with making a terrible day that much worse with their lack of caring or empathy|we took our kitty here to get spayed at the east liberty location  although they accomplished the job for a very reasonable price they were just extremely rude  i know that youre probably not making much working here receptionist ladies but just try to be nice|im conflicted as to how to proceed with this review  i think this place is a necessity for the city and their opendoor policy ensures no one will be turned away saving thousands of animals but their staff members are some of the most unprofessional and rude people ive ever met when they say that no animal will be euthanized unless it has a health or behavior issue believe that behavior is a very broad term  in their own words  any animal that doesnt tolerate and also welcome handling by strangers will be euthanized  i found this out when i fostered  kittens and all of the  week old kittens were to be put down because they were fussy  what the hell kitten isnt fussy theyre curious little guys that want down to explore  when i took the kittens in to offer up for adoption the exam room was right next to a room full of barking and howling dogs  there was a girl back there howling at the top of her lungs and laughing i guess she thought it was funny that the dogs were so terrified and distressed  the tech handled the kittens that were terrified because of all the noise very roughly and shoved them back into the crate injuring one of them  when one of the kittens tried to stop herself from being shoved in the crate it scratched her and she became very angry telling me they would all be euthanized for acting this way  luckily the volunteers must have handled them and helped to calm them because they were able to offer  them up for adoption  if it wasnt for the volunteers that place would be a hellhole for all those poor babieswhen i took one of the kittens that i ended up adopting to save them from certain death to be spayed the extremely rude tech handed her to me in a box to take home  after an hour and a half drive home i opened the box to find my kitten wrapped so tightly in a towel she couldnt move and she had another towel around her face so tight she couldnt breathe  i was never so angry in my life  i dont care how rude you are to me but do not take it out on the animals  the poor baby probably hissed or scratched at the tech so the tech decided to protect herself from the vicious  pound kitten by immobilizing her  i am now fostering  kittens from them that are very sick  they told me they do better getting well in a home  well no doubt when i got them home they were filthy  with feces all over their backside and they weigh less than they did  weeks ago when i took them there  when i asked the vet tech what kind of food they fed them she said oh it doesnt matter  it most definitely does matter  suddenly changing an animals food causes gastic distress vomiting and diarrhea  even the cheapest bag of pet food will tell you that  thats probably how they got so sick  im actually afraid to complain to anyone until the cats i fostered are adopted im terrified they will hurt the kittensi hate to say dont go here dont take your animals here because then only the animals suffer  but if you have a bad experience get names and write the managers and ceo and let them know specifics  hopefully getting the wrong people out of there  starting with the african american receptionistim sure this review will end up with the not recommended reviews  it seems all the truthful reviews get pushed to the back|im all for what the animal rescue league does  my parents just adopted the most precious  year old dog from the arl but the management here really needs to pull it together  the volunteers and staff are great but there are just a lot of issuesfirst my parents love their little seven pound dog but getting a small dog here is exceptionally difficult  you need to be prepared to go in at opening and take the dog home that day  they will only place a  hours hold on the animal and many people coming in here want small dogs  there was a lot of heartbreak before finally landing a dogsecond there seems to be a lot of oversights  my parents dog wasnt properly vaccinated which is really concerning  the poor baby had really severe kennel cough as well and he was sick for well over two weeks after adoption  they had balls and things in the playrooms that the dogs share which spreads disease  i think with some proper training andor change this place could fulfill its mission even better  the good news is that after looking at their s they seem to have successful financial management so this is easily possible  well unless you count the fact that they havent turned a  in the irs in  years according to guidestarmaybe they just need some stronger management|i go to this cvs all the time since i work in the neighborhood  im not a huge fan of it  i go mostly due to convenience  their greeting card selection is kind of lousy  i dont think ive ever found a decent card here  i keep trying every holiday or birthday but every section is just full of duds  also a lot of stuff is locked behind panels that you need the employees to unlock  like razor blades  and body wash  body wash  it drives me nuts that i need to ask someone to open that shelf for me  it makes no sense  staff is hitormiss with friendliness  some people are cheerful and some act like they want you to go awaygood things  i love their coupon rewards  i guess thats for all cvses not just this one but it keeps me coming back because i get mad style coupons like every other visit  and i had a good experience getting a walkin flu shot from the pharmacy from the friendly and quite attractive pharmacist  im just not crazy about the vibe here  it just seems kind of depressing with the stuff locked up and the smallish store with kind of a blargh selection  i would much rather go to other pharmacies but you cant beat this one for convenience for me anyway  and they have a parking lot if that helps you|the times ive been here its been an ok experience however their store hours are absolutely terrible closing at pm basically means theyre never open when i would need to go there despite this being more conveniently located walgreens and target end up getting most of my quickshop business simply due to late hours at night when i need to cook clean realize im out of toothpaste have a headache need a lastminute birthday card or whatever|exceptionally poor maintenance service they refused to start heat before midoctober and the centrally heated apartment grew very chilly as fall progressed on another occasion they refused to change a rusted and weak lock the lock eventually gave way and i locked myself into the bathroom after the incident i requested that the lock be changed immediately and one of the owners threatened saying that we were in default of our lease agreement for not keeping our apartment as clean as when it had been leased to us dealing with rocco and elisabeth is nice but good luck getting anything done with nick who seems to be increasingly handling the operations of rockwel|although i aplaud the western pennsylvania animal rescue league for the services they provide including their vaccine clinic im very dissapointed by the preferential treatment given to some individuals for those unfamiliar with the vaccine clinic it is first come first serve many of us get here more than an hour before the clinic starts and wait in line for those of us who have not as well behaved animals we tag team it and have one person stand in line while the other stays somewhere off to the side with the animalhowever on the july clinic one lady claimed to be first because she told a volunteer that she needed to stay in the car with her mom instead of waiting in line then when the paperwork was being passed out and those of us in line expressed the fact that she did not stand in line some of us even having a picture of those of us in line she repeated the fact that she has an elderly mom when that didnt suffice she said she had an agressive dog while i understand that agressive dogs should not be in close proximity to other animals or humans which they could harm that doesnt stop others who have less friendly animals to still stand in line and control our pets or have another member of the family stand in line on our behalf for the arl to let both individuals and their agressive dog sit in the car and be taken first is unfair to the rest of the participants what is even more concerning is that this agressive dog was allowed to sit in the waiting room for  minutes with  other owners and their pets some of us which had more than one pet if this truely was a case of an agressive animal then the arl did a disservice to its first  vaccine clinic participants who were in the waiting room in addition the release form states that agressive animals will not be tollerated it would be one thing if this was a one off but then someone came in claiming to have an apt for a vaccine booster at  even though they dont schedule appointments on sundays except for spay day and they took himif any one knows what i need to do or say to get preferential treatment in the future please let me know i get that this is a low cost clinic where the services are provided at cost and i greatly appreciate  that because it helps me care for my animals and the rescues we have at a reasonable cost however i shouldnt be punished or forced to wait because others cannot follow directions it would have been a different story if the preferential treatment was because of medical emergency but they wontarl please keep up the great services you provide but also please be mindful of all of your patientsthanksa loving pet owner|the coffee is really awesome but the brunch wasnt anything spectacular  it was also exceptionally busy and me and my three friends had to crowd around a teeny tiny table  all of us felt like the paniniburritos were totally edible and good just not great  the flavors just werent super tasty  i would say yay on coming here for coffee sort of yay on coming for foodit kind of bothers me that it shows up as the number one restaurant in pittsburgh  i mean it definitely does not deserve that ranking  i wouldnt want outoftowners coming to pittsburgh and thinking thats the best we have|reasons location and setting highland park is simply lovely  makes you feel as if you are in a small english town where time has stood still the art and small tables inside and outside are charming socially responsiblefair trade and international array of coffee fresh meat  local pasture raised meat local produce in their tasty paninis nice crowd and staff|ive read countless star reviews of this coffee shop and im sorry but i dont wholly agree with well everyone else so heres my slightly alternative take on the cafe  im aware like many reviewers on this site that not every place is aiming for me as the target customer but even still theres no way this is a five star coffee shop yes the coffee is good and if i happen to be lost in highland park someday on foot im sure id stop in to get it again  but the place itself was a turn off despite the interesting people that it attracts  glossy refinished exposed wood beams fake grape vines over the windows and odd light fixtures create a tacky atmosphere i cant overlook or sit in  i think this is a great coffee shop if you happen to own a house in highland park but for me its going to be voluto or espresso a mano from now on  its just not worth the drive|ill preface this by reminding anyone who reads my reviews that  stars is a good review for meit means its good but im not going to go out of my way for it  enricos tazza doro cafe is definitely very goodi love the location in highland park and the early morning crowd seemed pretty nice and very eclectic  we even ran in to a friend while we were there and had a nice chat  my girlfriend and i ordered lattes which were excellentthe space was overall very nice inside and while the selection of pastries was a bit thin i would say the ones they had looked good  i do wish they had more outdoor seating though  its tough to make the im a fan list for coffee houses  ill try it again and may change my review in the future  while im on the note of highland park i want to join the chorus of people who are dismayed by the recent hit and run involving the two bikers in highland park  accidents no matter how horrible do happen and as such im not as angry about the actual accident  but to just drive away and leave people severely injured by the side of the road is pretty wretched behavior  at this point i only hope that if you are the person who did this you will at least dedicate the rest of your life to doing good to balance your todate lousy behaviorits never too late|the espresso is definitely good although the interior is strange the location is cute for highland park my beef is with the snarky pittsburgh hipster employees that barely even engaged with my jokes made about their beta fish vivian seriously a boy beta named vivian that fish needs some recognition and love after basically flirting with ourselves it seemed like all they cared about was acting cool and barely providing an engaging espresso experience for me and my friend who were obviously excited to be there next time maybe there will be different employees but i have a feeling their lack of enthusiasm for serving the general public will deter me elsewhere sad times tazza i felt like i could have really loved you|this place was pretty cool  i mean defiantly felt like a place with a bunch of regulars but i felt welcome inside  all i got was a cup of coffee and a apple pastry  my mother got a espresso  both drinks were good but for being one of the top rated places on yelp i expected more than what i expirenced the apple pastry did not seem very fresh but it was still very good and worth eating  i guess i was just a little disappointed because i expected so much more than what i got|i think the lattes have improved since my last review and their soy cappuccinos are the best ive ever had in fact i never even cared for them until trying tazza doros i still hold their teas in high regard however the food here sucks theyve always had a limited sandwich menu but at some point even that has been reduced to three choices i am a sucker for a good veggie sandwich especially in combination with caffeine even though enricos is an easy walk from my home i find myself either walking further or driving elsewhere for the caffeinated lunch experience i guess they are trying to keep focus on the brews but i dont think its that hard to do both i mean the staff seems highly competent they have a kitchen and sandwiches are pretty simple recipes to follow and learn with a new lunch joint in the hood park bruges why not expand lunch options rather than downgrade to the point of forfeiting without even the slightest struggle|still one of the best places to get soy capps but they no longer have an extensive tea list whats left is not a bad selection but there are dramatically less choices so its no longer where i would go to sample new varieties of tea sandwich menu is even more severely limited and it seems that pretty much all the food is provided by us foods or the like nothing is local itd be way cool if they would source their pastries and bread locally until then it is simply a great place to get coffee and espresso with nice vibes and pleasant service|so i went on a marathon  hour bike ride right before heading to enricos for the first time and on my last mile all i could think was iced caffe mocha iced caffe mocha over and over again  did i mention that i forgot my water bottle on my ride too  i was a desperate woman at the end of that oneso i got home aired myself out and drove myself to enricos since a previous yelper mentioned she had the best iced caffe mocha there  there was easy street parking right out front and i really liked that it was nestled in the middle of a neighborhood and not a loud crowded street  tables are large enough for good work space and folks had their laptops out inside enjoying the free wifi while the tables outside were filled with friendsso why the  stars  well the iced caffe mocha was a bit subpar  the syrup was all at the bottom leaving my first couple sips very watery  could have been a better mix  would i give this another try  sure but i definitely will ask for a nice hard shake of my iced caffe mocha before taking a swigthe coffee place at the walnut mall in shadyside is still my favorite for the iced coffee of the year award  try the iced or blended ghiradelli mocha when you are shopping shadystyle  awesome|the coffee was ok but the service and ambiance left much to be desired the place was dirty with straw wrappers etc on the floor the light fixtures were too modern to be considered cozy there were four people on staff but it took at least  minutes for one of them to stop gossiping with the others and take our order  i got the feeling that this place has had a lot of success and the owners have let things slide it was ok but in looking for a coffee shop to make my regular hangout i would not go back|we ordered a double espresso which looked more like a single shot cozy coffeeshop with an ample amount of seatingthere were different types of coffee available for purchase to drink there and beans to take homecute neighborhood coffeeshop type feel|on three separate visits ive enjoyed three great cups of coffee no complaints there unfortunately that consistency hasnt been there for everyone on a visit with my wife her latte came out far too milky probably just a mistake so we reasoned that this place deserved a second chance the next time around we order a pair of cappuccinos one with vanilla now before i go any further i recognize that cappuccinos are typically made without sugar or added flavoring i have also been to a ton of neighborhood coffee shops have heard the question wet or dry a thousand times sometimes a wet cap is really what youre hoping for in a latte and even when its not like most people i dont snark or complain when someone gives me a cup that isnt quite what i was hoping for i usually end up liking it anyways my taste buds arent that delicateperhaps you can see where im going with this story vanilla cappuccino i get it its not something thats done but when someone asks you for something you dont sell just explain the situation politely if you feel the need to snark share knowing glances or anything along those lines just stifle it trust me ive seen many professionals perform better with requests far more ridiculous theres really never any need for snobbery so ive got to dock tazza doro a bit too bad because the coffee is pretty good|this is one of those places i really want to love you walk in it is super cute nice ambiance friendly staff people are reading and talking none of these are bad things i got a regular coffee black and a sandwich which came close to  a little pricey but whatever the sandwich was just gross old bread that was just past stale to the gummy gross stage almost no toppings and some weird spread it was the mushroom sandwich the coffee was just a little off i couldnt put my finger on why but it didnt seem right then i looked into the back room there is bread stacked everywhere no wonder mine was stale i might go back for coffee in a pinch but i wouldnt get food there again|i dont drink coffee so keep moving if thats what you care about surprisingly quiet library quiet coffee shop which is nice unless youre hoping to have a conversation without the looming selfconsciousness of being overheard surprisingly cheap icedchilled tea there was a large group of neighbors gathering at the outside tables and a fair amount of passing conversation which suggests this might be a community gathering spot for highland park residents hoping to be inspired in future visits|went in as a guest of a friend of mine who is a member there nice atmosphere  lot of oldddd folks and they seem to market themselves as silver fitness sort of fitness center this may be a turnoff for some younger peoplethey had a lot of machines and exercise gear   pools and tan bedsetc etc  id probably prefer personally to work out somewhere with a younger crowd|this is not a review on this gym it is a review on their customermembership service i just called there all i wanted to know is what their monthly fees were simple right wrong they want your name and phone number and the rights to your first born child and then they wont even tell you anything without you physically coming to them to talk about whats best for you i took psychology classes i know what they are trying to do by talking to you face to face i am sorry but i want a gym not a drug dealer i dont need you to try to shove your products down my throat i want to go somewhere to work out and be left alone thats why i wear headphones and dont make eye contact i just wish places like this would give you a straight answer about their membership fees without hassling you i wont go here now period because i dont believe in these kind of tactics just be straight with people is that so hard|delicious wings  sometimes a bit too deep fried for my taste but really tasty flavors and spices we went for allyoucaneat wings night but sadly i could barely finish my first dozen beer selection is much improved since  turadg as post they have about  or so available to choose from|the food here is okay  wings bbq bar foods the floor here is always super slippery  it doesnt matter if i am wearing heels or sneakers  i just dont get why the floor is like and ice skating rink|the front serves as a good pittsburgh sports bar its a particularly great place to watch the penguins in the spring when they open up the front wall there are lots of hdtvs and there is a good selection of beer the food however is bland and is terrible bbq even for the northeast i would not come here unless you want to watch a game that you cannot see at home|pretty good bar food  its conveniently located and a fun atmosphere|ive been here quite a few times and i always try to like it cause theres a lack of good sports bars near pitt they have a ton of nice hdtvseverytime i go there is always a weird taste to one or more of the beers that i get i was just there for the pittoakland game and got a redhook i drink this beer regularly and something was wrong with the beer its definitely hard to describe but something is always off others in my party notice it toothe food is hit or miss i got the french onion soup last time it was good nothing ground breaking but solid soup ive had the pork nachos and they were blah|i found buffalo blues to be merely ok  i thought that their prices were a bit high for the size of the portions and their wings were rather small  i actually liked the wing sauces i tried though red hot and spicy garlic  our server was friendly but not terribly attentive  i would probably only go again on an allyoucaneat wings night  for  i would certainly get my moneys worth and the quality of the food was oksurprisingly lots of vegetarian options  a vegetarian in our party was floored by the possibility of having every burger or chicken sandwich made without meat or meat products|wednesday is wing night ie eat your face off night for   you can eat unlimited wings with your choice of various sauces for several hours if you can top it off with a brownie  theyre quite goodive mostly had the wings at blues  i like all of the sauces but the burgers are good as well whatever you do make sure to get the sweet potato fries  tip your waitress especially if her name is meg|wing night wednesdays  cent price wings and  beer at william penn on tuesdays and my body is not hurting too badly the next day buffalo blues for all you can eat wings there are a ton of sauces to pair with these wings they bring them out  at a time so plan on ordering your next selection when your wings come out because they take quite a bit of time to come i dont think i have ever eaten the other food here except for the wings because they are pretty good the only downside to this place is that service is really really slow|this is a great place for happy hour to catch the game or to have a smallish private party definitely check out their website for the daily happy hour specials but monfri from pm they have  off all drafts priced blues booze nachos and quesadillas basket of wings  pieceseast end beers are  all day every daythe food here is not spectacular but ive always enjoyed what ive gotten being from the south i wouldnt think to order the bbq or catfish here so i cant vouch for those the spicy wings cheese sticks salads and grilled cheese are all good the regulars and servers are pretty nice people we watched the saintsteelers game here with our saints attire on and easily made friends the whole night they also have a small loft area that you can reserve for free for a private party and youre supplied a waitress for the evening finally they deliver i love having another delivery option besides chinese and pizza now i can be lazy and eat a big salad|i ate at this restaurant last night with three dining companions  we decided to sit in the bar area at a high table which had views of the ample number of tvs  the beer list that they had was nice with about  different beers on tap and a nice selection of bottles  i ended up having the philly shackamaximum with my waitress telling me that she preferred the long trails porter  it was served in a chilled glass and tasted pretty good to mefor dinner we attempted to start off by ordering the blues bbq pork nachos  we were told that they did not have any pork and so we were not able to order it  at this point we were also told that they did not have any veggie burgers as well  so we started out with the chicken chili nachos  they were pretty good and were covered with real cheese as opposed to nacho cheese which was to my liking  for dinner i decided on having the lovely lisas salad since i love both blue cheese and granny smith apples  upon receiving the salad i dug in  the chicken was cooked nicely moist and tender and there was a nice coating of blue cheese on the salad  however there was a problem since there were no granny smith apples on the salad  whenever the waitress came back to check on us i asked about the missing apples  she went to the kitchen and came back and told us that they were out of them and promptly left  i am not normally one to complain but i feel like something could have been substituted in for the apples or that i should have been told before ordering or they could have discounted the salad but none of that occurred  it is sad that it happened too because the rest of my salad was pretty good but that left the proverbial bitter taste in my mouththe bottom line is that i have been here before and the food is generally good   however leaving a major part off an item and being told that the kitchen is out without any rectification will make me think twice before returning here again  it is a shame because buffalo blues does have potential|my coworkers and i had lunch here on a friday afternoon and it was a pretty meh experience for me  we were seated all the way in the back of the restaurantbar in a room that i didnt even know existed so apparently buffalo blues is bigger than i thought  its nice that they have some tables away from the main bar areai went for the hot veggie sandwich with sweet potato fries in some kind of attempt to be healthy  the sweet potato fries werent too bad with a good flaky crisp  the sandwich left something to be desired  it wasnt hot first of all  id say the slightly crumbly bread had been toasted with the cheese but all the veggie ingredients were cold leaving an overall lukewarm effect on the sandwich  the hummus spread didnt taste much like hummus and was thick and pastey instead of smooth and creamy  there wasnt a lot of exciting flavor  it was just bellyfiller really  i guess thats what i get for trying to order healthy here  i just wasnt much interested in it and i dont think it was worth anywhere near   i better have a darn good sandwich if im paying   also it was relatively small in size  i dont have a huge appetite so that wasnt a problem  but i guess i think an  sandwich should either be awesomely delicious or big enough that i can take half home  buffalo blues was neithernot particularly interested in returning for any reason|superbowl sunday at the blues i came to meet a group of friends to watch the  who really cares about this game  show i was mainly interested in seeing madonna i do have to say that we had a server who gave us the utmost attention we had been seated at some tables near the bar mid restaurant that were wobbling and driving me crazy at the request of the party she moved us up front and center to a much better and stable seat much better view to see the material girl so our server gets  stars not only for that reason she kept the glasses full and kept checking in with us and took it all in stride as we ordered at different times and all had separate checks very classy wish i could remember her name young girl with dirty blond hair the food was pretty blah in my opinion bar food none too exceptional we had nachos that were on slightly stale chips good size everyone had a burger or sandwich as i glanced over to my friends pulled pork it looked dry and sad left sitting on the plate she said it was eh i ordered a gobbler club sandwich it was humongous but not that tasty pretty dry how can you go wrong with a club but the thick cuts of turkey did not sit well with me and i didnt like it at all bad texture the commercials and time with fun friends saved the experience but i wouldnt go back to eat just drinks and sports i like the location easy to park close to shadyside madonna really was the show stopper this night and unless she performs here i most likely wont be back|the best thing about buffalo blues revolves around sundays during football season for me personally its one of the best places to catch an nfl gameespecially if youre not a steelers fan on any given sunday youll find fans of just about every team in the nfl taking in a game so the atmosphere is a positive one seating is the only issue get there early or you might end up standing to see your particular game as seating can be a premium by the time the games begin luckily the tvs there are lots of them are all labeled with the days matchups so finding the game youre looking for isnt a problemthe draft beer selection usually has something for everyone from local craft brews by east end brewing to seasonals and your simpler standards hello pbr so if youre a beer person you wont be disappointedas far as service goes its hitormiss ive had mostly great service at the bar but ive also had average to below average service at tables during bigger sporting events  primarily steelers games  the service can be even more iffy due to the sheer volume of people in the bar areaoverall i have to rate the food as average i love their boneless wings and their wing sauces are all very excellent their pulled pork is really tender and delicious as well but most of their sandwiches and burgers are simply average the fries can be either really good or too soggy and greasy i think the inconsistency in the quality of the cooking is the main issue the menu reads really well which raises your expectations but sometimes the execution will leave you a little disappointed its never horrible but youll rarely be blown away by your mealin the end im giving buffalo blues a higher rating based on the experience during sporting events which lets face it is the real draw of a sports bar as far as sports bars go its my favorite place to catch a game they always get a good crowd for games whether sundays during the nfl season saturdays during big college games or for pens games and if you stick to the wings and beer odds are your experience will be great theres a good chance that you can go in and find fans of your team if youre an outoftowner looking for a game and the crowd is much more accepting friendly and relaxed than the crowds ive experience in other sports bars in town most of my average experiences revolved around nongame times when you try to get a more traditional meal and realize that there are just better options in shadyside for lunch and dinner|so i went to buffalo blues tonight for the second time not the second time tonight the second time in my life for dinner and some drinks and to sum up my experience in a few words both times it was about what i expected  just a fine sports bar  no more no lessill start with the drinks  they have a good draft selection and supposedly theyve got a nice bottle list too though i didnt have a look at it so i cant judge and the happy hour special compliments it well  off all drinks pmpm   plus they have east end drafts at glass all the time though they were out of big hop the only east end choice they have when i was there i dont know if this is a regular occurrence but if it is they better do something about it  the bartenders were friendly and quick to serve qualities that carried over to the food service as wellthe menu has a pretty good selection of puby and southwesternthemed foods from which i picked the black bean and corn quesadilla  although at the end i was running low on guacamole which is  extra for a small cup and sour cream this is a small quibble  the meal overall  was good and since i got it with the happy hour special i cant complain  one thing i will mention is that there arent too many vegetarian choices on the menu im not vegetarian but i try not to eat too much meat so i notice these things so if youre a vegetarian i would try to look up the menu beforehand just to be sure theres something for youi know i havent said much negative about buffalo blues in this review yet im still giving it only three stars  this is the kind of place that makes me appreciate the word versions of the ratings that yelp gives us  aok which if you didnt know is how yelp describes threestar reviews is exactly how i would describe buffalo blues  the comparison i keep going to in my head is die hard   its not nearly as good as its predecessor but its still something im fine with popping in every once in a while when theres nothing better to watchto sum it up  im not a big sports guy  buffalo blues though it is a sports bar is not the place that would sway me to go to watch a game there with my friends ill still say that some kind of playoff game of the steelersravens i watched at big jims was one of the best sportswatching experiences of my life  and judging it as a sports bar it didnt do anything to justify my giving it anything but just fine  but im sure ill go back there for happy hour again sometime|when hotlicks died buffalo blues was born it really is a pittsburgh staple but come onfood is really really average i love the ribs and wings but its about the same as any other rib place in the city only they charge an arm and a leg for it this place is for the people that feel that they are at a real rib place but dont want to cross centre or penn ave to get real ribs it technically is in shadyside so your mercedes will be safe the ambiance the restaurant is always crowded not just crowded but packed with teens underage drinking families with too many kids that overflow to your space and collage kids who also spill over from the bar its loud as hell forget about a nice quiet dinner there seems to be no consideration for customers at all last time i was there there was a st patricks day party it was not st patricks day that took over the whole place though the staff tried nah they didnt really try to keep them in the so called party room i was bumped into several times spilled my beer and couldnt hear my wife speak but as long as they got their money they could give a crap oh and there are like  tvs to interrupt any conversation at your tablewant to sit in the bar area good luck you will see a mix of drunk people women who look like highend prostitutes and college kids who are only missing a beer bong also its loud as hellthe wonderful staff it seems like its everyones first day to put it lightly the staff suck to be sure you will be waiting for your your drinks food and bill for a very very long time expect to be there for about  hours the wait staff are forgetful inattentive and very sloppy at their job it pains me to leave any tip for them most of the staff are hot stacked absolutely stupid and should be working at hooters not a place where your bill will be upwards of  for two people be prepared to be met with this saying oh like ohmygod i am so sorry i forgot that he he oh shes twisting her finger in her hair while shes talking you will get bad serviceperiod in fact i cant remember the last time a wait person actually wrote down my order and theyre idiots so no worriesthe food kinda good menu is huge youll find something you like but i go there about  times a year for the food it is way too expensive do not take a date there your average bill for a meal with actual proteins will run you in the high s without booze there are so many barfood places that dont claim to be high class that are just as good as this place i grew up with the rib sauce and love it but for your average consumer skip itthis place is a wannabe sports bar that tries too hard to be high end just watch out for the vomiting college kids with trust fundstheyre everywhere|the buffalo chicken dip is very good their wing nights are decent gold rushdeath row are probably the two best flavors in my opinion wednesday night trivia is also fun thought it took much longer than expected a good sports bar to say the least usually went there for world cup and euro cup soccer games as well|oh how the mighty have fallen this place used to be good something happened and the wings are small dry and just generally bad since wings are supposed to be their thing this is pretty unacceptablewriting this review makes me sad because it is a great place to drink beer and watch the game the beer is reasonably priced but the food is just expensive for what it is i essentially live across the street so i know ill go back but i hope some of these poor reviews will help them turn things around in the kitchen|good place to watch a sports game  beer specials were good food is very overpriced though  the wings are about the worst ive ever had and ive had alot of wings growing up in buffalo ny|pass on this place there are better restaurants mere feet awaythe menu here is too large which is a sure sign none of the food is going to be good  and its not good  some of the salads are alright but its just not good foodthe service is friendly and prompt but the beer is over priced  they do have a good selection thoughthis place is open late if you need a bite to eat but there are so much better options out there|their food is okay and beer selection is diverse and good the problem i have with the place is that buffalo bills fans congregate here and cheer on every mediocre play their football team makes or almost makes so its like watching the superbowl except its a losing record team stopping a team on third down|i have a lovehate relationship with this place  i love it because its extremely close to me so its convenient when im craving a beer and the atmosphere on sundays is outstanding  im a giant steeler fan but youll probably find fans from all  teams in buffalo blues which gives it a fun and exciting feel during nfl sundays  however i hate it because i believe the alcohol and food is overpriced  the food wouldnt rub me the wrong way so much if i thought it was worth the price but i dont  not even a little bit  the only thing i have found to be delicious there were the wings however you can go to almost any other bar to get delicious and cheaper wings  so its not really much of a win at all  also i want to have a handful of beers during the games but i dont want to empty my pockets doing it  so all in all i recommend going once and awhile mainly on sundays for a beer or two but other than that its not worth much of a visit|i have mixed feelings about this place  ill say up front i only ever go there on sundays for football and i would never go there for any other reason  it is the only bar i know of in the city where you can reliably find every nfl game televised and enjoy your sunday if youre not a steelers fan  pretty much every team is represented by the crowd on sundays with a disproportional number of bills and redskins fans  the crowd is generally friendly with many of the same faces from week to weekthey tend to have a wide selection of beers that rotates pretty regularly but wide selection doesnt always mean good selection  that said sometimes they get some really great beers that you wouldnt expect to find at a sports bar  whatever you do dont order a bloody mary theyre atrociously bad  the staff is almost universally friendly with the exception of one barback who seems to always be in a bad mood and rude to customers he often takes over as bartender later in the day on sundays  that said the wait staff dont seem to know much about the food or beers that are offered often mischaracterizing new beers that are on tap or giving wrong information about things on the menuthe food is mediocre and overpriced  when two of us go for one game on a sunday drink  beers each and each order an entre we generally end up with a tab in the  range depending on what were drinking that day  in a city that is almost universally accommodating to vegetarians this place is most decidedly not  they have a veggie burger which is actually pretty good but its the only decent thing on the menu for a vegetarian to eat there is also a grilled cheese sandwich and a veggie sandwich both of which are bland to the point of tasteless  its like eating plain bread  they have  entre salads and every one of them has meat as a defining ingredient  they dont even have beans so you could have decent veggie nachos  i know its a sports bar but i dont want to eat the same veggie burger every sunday for  weeks  it gets old  fastupshot  in the absence of a new sports bar opening up well be back next season but not before then|i would take advantage of all you can eat wings on wednesday we went on a regular oll sunday night and even though the wings were tasty my frugal self wouldve rather had ayce we tried a variety of sauces we ordered  wings and every  can be a different flavor the buffalo blues sauce was ok it was just their signature bbq sauce we also tried garlic parm honey teriyaki  gold rush all were ok the boozy buffalo is a good drink it consist of smirnoff orange tanquery jose cuervo captain triple sec oj fresh squeezed lemon and a splash of coke i seriously felt fabulous after one its served in a mason jar lauren was a nice server even though the table in front of us put her through some bs they ate all of their food then complained to the server and asked for the manager complaining that what they got it wasnt what they ordered no idea why they waited until every scrap of food was gone to complain but you know youll have that kudos to lauren for keeping a smile on her face|had a wonderful beef and pulled pork burger at buffalo blues yesterday the food and drinks were greathowever as far as i could discern this sports bar only had one waitress trying to cover over  customers and this on a saturday with the world cup games i saw only one waitress and a bar man the gal was valiantly trying to keep up but the burger was great|wings are overpriced and the quality of them are bad they were tough and greasy the staff are pleasant but then over all experience was too expensive for a sports bar|not bad atmosphere little cramped in the booths in the bar area wings were really good actually and the boozy buffalo was yummy|decided to grab a drink and a quick dinner with my ball n chain at the bar  i ordered the half n half combo of soup and sandwich grilled cheese and tomato soup  the husband had the grilled chicken sammie  as soon as the kitchen dumped out my order the bartender immediately took issue with the portion size  it was much appreciated  he immediately went back and got me more food  regardless of how good the service the food was not worth coming for  the soup was the consistency of the stuff in the canned soup that they instruct you to add water to prior to heating minus the whole adding water step  as a result it was as thick as a dip  despite not being soup it made a great dip for the potato chips  sit at the bar|i end up coming here more frequently than i would like due to their trivia night on wednesdays unfortunately every time i wish i was somewhere elsetheir claim to fame should be their wings but they are consistently some of the worst in pittsburgh the sauces are forgettable they consistently come out cold and they cost  for  forgetting wing night obviously youd think that you could at least wash it down with a cold beer but whatever room they keep their kegs in must just have a window unit air conditionerservice is normally fine but the place is always dirty and hot as hell i wouldnt recommend head next door to mad mex or literally anywhere across the highland ave bridge|the hot and sour soup was ok everything else was basically inedible water was not noticeably hosey as per other reviews more than  of the buffet was american food and a lot of the rest was seafood that almost had to be krab considering the price of the buffet no potstickers no pork egg rolls no spareribs no wonton soup|this is my goto place for curing a hangover i dont know what it is about chinese buffets the day after a long night of round after round but it does the trick i also like to come here before i go grocery shopping at the nearby trader joes because everybody knows its a bad idea to go shopping for food stuff on an empty stomachall of my favorites are here veggie lo mien string beans mac n cheese crab rangoon hot  sour soup i havent seen dan bing egg pancakes in awhile but when they have them they are out of this world with some peanut sauce another thing i miss is creamed spinach i have yet to see this dish on a pittsburgh buffet but if you go outside of the city it is a staple among chines buffetsanother star got knocked off for the lack of fresh fruit on the dessert table canned pineapple and mandarin oranges will always carry that metallic taste to them that is just no comparison to having the real thing|the location is convenient but i was not a fan of the food i had shrimp and chinese veggies and crab rangoon they cut the veggies way too big and the sauce was bland i wont go back for food but the crab rangoon was ok they didnt give any sauce you have to ask for it that sucks|just ate there right next to gamestop  google has  small booths  ordered the pepper steak w onion  food is fast fresh  hot but mine had too much onion  not enough steak at the end of the meal i was just eating onions with rice though i hear this is healthy for you counter lady was cordial but didnt reply when customers told her have a nice day awkward i know that english isnt her first language but she needs to catch on that people are wishing her well wasnt stuffed full either despite having eaten a large plate i usually get this feeling eating asian this is basically a nice place to go for lunch that wont ruin your appetite for dinner side note food is very clean brushed my teeth an hour before w toms of maine fluoridefree peppermint  still had minty fresh breath an hour after eating|this is an average chinese buffet the food was not bad but not impressive neither plus some cheap american food the food was a little too greasy even by american chinese food standard and my stomach complained soon after i left that place to me thats a nogo signalon the other hand they seemed to have a nonbuffet counter nextdoor perhaps the food would be better there|i think  or  stars is accurate for this joint the chicken is quality meat and its lightly sauted but the sauce is to blah its a nice place to sit down and have chinese food if you have no other local options  its my last resort for chinese food in the area prices are absurd|china garden is your basic americanized chinese food with one possible exception  its got an above average buffet  most chinese buffets ive eaten at range from meh to ick  but the vegetables seem fresh and crisp the chicken here is tender and not rubbery and the egg rolls are fairly goodits worth checking out if you need a quick meal|i needed a quick snack before doing errands and heading home and was in the shopping strip where there is a trader joes near bakery squarei am usually an asian food snob having lived for many years in san francisco  bay area but i thought id try some amerasian foodi ordered moo shoo pork which wasnt badjust kind of bland and not teeming with porkthat being said the vegetables were cooked well with a nice slightly crisp not soggy texture id sat if you want quite decent not quite chinese  food  and quickly china garden wouldnt be a bad place to stop|i had to get new tires mounted and balanced and when i went to pay the guy at the register actually says something to the effect of do you have any idea what this is supposed to cost so i could charge you  and you wouldnt know the difference joking or not why even go there|good for altar bar but they didnt have fries|seems like a decent garage i was really in a jam and needed a repair done and had already bought the needed part however they would not install it im not sure why their policy is this way perhaps theres good reasoning behind it but it left me in a jam most garages mark up parts  maybe thats why or maybe they dont want everyone walking in the door with their own parts i wasnt expecting a warranty i just wanted to part put on the car|not cheap by any means  rather expensive for the most part others rave about this guy but honestly i dont really see what makes him that great he charges just like any other mechanicsparts are marked up just like everyone else it is not like one can barter with what the prices a mechanic charges otherwise you cant get the car back|the kelly strayhorn is a good idea which is poorly executed  the facility has problems  the stairs on the house are too narrow causing trips the bathrooms dont really have the capacity for over  patrons etcbeyond the facility you get to the actual poorly executed idea  the staff is extremely unknowledgeable about the subjects they are producing  for instance none of the programmers on staff have any training in performing arts they are all visual arts people playing at another field  as a result they dont even know what they are really producing and any experienced person in the field can tell  the sad part about this is they really try  they throw staff and new ideas at every opportunity  dont expect great performances here expect a talked up mediocre performance  audience follows content and they dont have content or the staff that is knowledgeable enough to know better  check back in in a couple of years  this apple is too green to eat much less pay for|locked out of my house at pm called they arrived at pm took  minute to open cost dollars i used a different company to open my car door at  pm before and only cost so|pros great locationreasonable rentall utilities included in rent staff are ok maintenance issues get fixed fairly quicklycons  apartments are super old the oven doesnt work too well within  months of our living we ran out of hot water at least  times and this one time it lasted for  days during jan or feb i dont remember it was a major hasslethe maintenance isnt that great some parts of the complex feels really dirtyheating isnt that great  they control the heating and there have been days when i didnt want to go home because of the mediocre heating its not nice and warm as it could have been but i guess you get what you pay forgood for cheap student housing though not terrible place but nowhere near nice|i rented from jj land for two years  i had a small apartment with a low rentjj was extremely receptive to my needs while moving in and moving outwhen i called maintenance they performed the service i expected given the cost of my renti feel jj land is an adequate budget landlord  you get what you pay for  my rent was cheap  they seemed to try to do a triage when it came to repairs  they were extremely quick for one emergency i encountered and inadequate for another emergency when we suffered a communication breakdown and they didnt understand the scope of the issueper word of mouth it appears mozart is the best  forbes management is my favorite landlord based on my renting experience  ive heard nothing but bad regarding lobosin summary my rent was low  the quality of the apartment and quality of their service matched my expectations based on that rental price|i arrived on a thursday afternoon at pm when there was absolutely no other soul in the bakery except for the staff my pumpkin pastry with carmel topping was alright i also tried the key lime cake and sour cream and apple cake the key lime cake was definitely the best of the threewhile ive been to better bakeries i will definitely be back i have heard stories of wonder and delight from other friendsthere is a small seating area with tables and a water dispenser for diners|i came here to buy some desserts for a dinner party later that evening as it was my first time at food glorious food i asked the woman to help me choose a variety of desserts she was patient and answered my questions on the various goods but for some reason i thought it would be a quicker process and she would be more decisive with suggesting things  it felt more drawn out also i had ordered a peanut butter caramel rice crispy treat and she did not cut it into pieces after she offered and she placed the fruit tart near the flaps to the top so the cream got smushed into itthat being said one of the guests really enjoyed the chocolate chip cookies  he ate one and then came back for the second another enjoyed the napoleon and the peanut butter caramel rice crispy treat and pumpkin roll were good the desserts were good and had a homemade feelbased on the other reviews i would like to come back and try other things here at the bakery such as the sandwiches quiches pies and cinnamon rolls  theyve got a cute rustic sitting area and they take credit card i came here in the early afternoon on a saturday so they may have sold out of some items|ive had a wide range of experiences here  lets just say when i first moved here one of the employees gave me poor advice and ended up totally screwing up my title  its been a tremendous ordeal to get it fixed  another employee tried to help me fix it and screwed that up too  now im working with a third person who seems very competent and committed to helping me solve this problem but even she is like i cant believe those other people told you to do thatthey made this so much harder than it needed to be  my thoughts exactlywork with barb if you can  she knows her stuff  i dont quite trust anybody else to help me properly  also theyre only open from  or is it  so you pretty much have to go before work or on saturday  and i will be going in tomorrow at  until my car title saga finally comes to its conclusionalso parking is free in their lot  and if you are a aaa member i think your fees are lower or something like that  i do have aaa so it makes sense for me to come here  i cant say what the experience is like for non members|going through aaa is a bit worse than your average dmv the woman working the front desk was nice but that was about the sum of it the guy who processed our registration was patronizing and slow he also made a mistake that required fixing after the fact i cant say im enamored with the peculiarities of pennsylvania licensing laws|i have been a long time member and i have never experienced any problems the few times ive called for service until last night i accidentally locked my keys in my car before going into a social club i had just joined recently after a few drinks i left to go home and realized what i had donei called home to see if someone could come and bring me a spare key but got no answer so i called aaa for help after going through that stupid menu press  for this press  for thatetc i was kept on hold for nearly a half and hour what the hell do they only have one person answering the phone for the whole county i finally gave up and decided to just walk home at around  at night it was a real treat for someone  years old to walk nearly a mile alone late at night half tipsy on a street with no sidewalkshalf of which was uphill it could only have been worse if it were raining i am lucky i didnt have a heart attack after making it to the top of the hillif this is the kind of service they give now im going to have to rethink about renewing by membership next year i damn near crushed the card and threw it in the garbage can when i got home i was so angry|this review is for the titling  registration of vehicles and not for other aaa services offered at this location the good thing is that they have free parking you have to go through the gate and the receptionist inside will give you a token to leave the parking lot timing is everything if you go in beginning or end of month then its generally busier saturdays are busier it turned out i went on a saturday at the beginning of a month probably the worst time to go and waited about  mins the staff who processed my application was pleasant and made the process flow well once it was my turn it also depends what the customers are there for renewals take just a few mins whereas new registration and titling take up to  mins depending how prepared the customer is ie do they have their previous title insurance papers based on  of staff members x  minscustomerstaff member you can get an idea of what your wait time will be i did not see a staff member process more than  applications per houri went in for a new title  registration and the process took about  mins as i was fully prepared with all the right paperwork one thing that the aaa people will do here is go to your parked vehicle in the parking lot and physically verify the vin on your vehicle so no need to trace your vin or go to a notary to get a picture of vin notarized or anything|it is nothing like the bars in san francisco i dont know where you people went im not enough of a scenester to appreciate shadow lounge to the fullest i dont care for poetry slams or open mic the night i visited they had a live band playing an early set it ended at pm i was intrigued by the sandwiches they make on one side of the bar  whatever it was smelled amazing and no doubt smells even better after youve had a couple beers speaking of beers on tap selection is small   beers and even the fridge wasnt impressing me they do have full bar howeverthere was also another room with couches and big tv and another club  linked to shadow lounge that looked more hiphop and danceclubby there was no dancing going on though and the room was rather empty|shadow lounge brings good music to east liberty in pittsburgh for this they deserve  stars alonehowever the one time i was there for a reggae concert it was incredibly crowded but even worse it was impossible to get a drink at the bar there were two bartenders trying to serve  people in sum come for the music only|great clubbarloungevenue great mix of people and music with decent bartenders and good prices on beer|there were zero other people here aside from my friend and i|i was here for a concert the other night apparently theres much more to the venue than the side we were on where the stage was but it was a pretty small area for a pretty big crowd ok so we arrived shortly before the opening act and ordered beers  for a yuengling bottle isnt ideal but whatever we snagged a table with stools near the door before too many people got there by the time the opener was over the place was packed shoulder to shoulder and whether we stood or remained on our stools it was nearly impossible to see the stagei liked that it was an intimate venue but that many people packed into such a small space with expensive drinks and not even a good view not the best venue ive ever been to|i spent about an hour here  most of the associates are older men that take pride in there work and are all about customer service and getting the job done  theses associates were always working and never just standing around talking  whenever they finished one task they would ask someone else if they needed helpnow if only the key copies they made were accurate|i love hardware stores  love  but this home depot has disappointed me  the location is great but the floor staff is unhelpfultonight was a great example of i dont like the floor staff  my vacuum stopped picking up anything but the largest pieces of dust  after opening her up i quickly realized i needed a new belt  it was pouring down rain but i put on my rainboots grabbed an umbrella and hoofed it over to ye ole home depot  i had to stand over the shoulders of fiveyep i counted fiveemployees in appliances for a full minute before one of them would help meafter someone directed me to the vacuum parts i had two male employees stop by to see if i needed help as i searched for the correct belt  i had the vacuums name and number written down as well as the belt style and had the actual busted belt with me  yet each of these men acted like i was some stupid girl  did you unplug the vacuum before you removed the old belt one asked me  duh  im not an idiot  the other later asked do you always wear bright yellow rainboots when youre doing repairs and snickered  look all i said to both gentlemen was im just looking for the correct style number  but thanksi received similar treatment i stopped by to buy a new set of bits for my drill  you know drills come in more than one kind right i was asked  and when i needed a new bag of dirt of my cacti i was question about why i wanted succulent dirt over potting soil  every time a male employee here approaches me im questioned or given unsolicited advice in a snotty waythis girl may wear bright yellow rainboots but i am also the norm abram of my family  aka im pretty handy  oh and the vacuum works perfectly nowshout out goes to the check out attendants who were super polite  nice work ladies|this was my first time to this home depot  very impressed with the customer service here  we were redoing a bathroom and went in for more tiles  they were out of them  however a staff member helped us use other tile and decorative pieces to compliment the tile we already had instead of schlepping all the way to monroeville to pick up the tile up were originally looking for  we were very happy with the result|fish out of water here when it comes to hardware related things  i mean i know how to swing a hammer and push a button to start a machine but all the other stuffmehive only really gone in here to pick up paint so ill focus on that  i feel bad for the lady that works the paint counter  each time im in there she always seems to be by herself with a line of customers all wanting there base paint tinted  i dont believe there was ever a time i could just walk up to the counter and have my paint mixed for me  give that woman a hand|this is a pretty good hd it is somewhat smaller than the ones in ross park and monroeville but they seem to stock most of the same items occasionally i do need to go to monroeville to find specific items however with a s house i spend quite a bit of time here for getting materials for repairscustomer service is about average some people are very helpful others not so much in general they seem to be better than the lowes at the waterfront at least hd people know where items are in the store i cant tell you how many times ive received completely different and wrong answers to finding stuff at lowesi would prefer a small hardware store such as an ace closer to me for things like nuts bolts and screws ace seems to have a better selection than hd does for hardtofind items hd has most of the basics covered however and probably a little cheaperi generally avoid their paint section except for equipment i prefer the service at a sherwinwilliams or masterwork paint store weve had decent luck with their garden department weve had to return a few plants that died the day after we planted them but they have never given us any problems with returns its a bigbox home improvement store for better or worse its a convenient location with a decent selection nuff said|most of the home depots ive seen are the same and that includes this one aisles full of hardware supplies tools bathroom accessories and even a small nursery for gardening my favorite section is the tool section seeing that im a diyer do it yourself if you didnt already know that i enjoy building maintaining and fixing things in my own home as opposed to hiring a contractor and paying a boat load im best known at the home depot in monroeville i come in there so often a lot of the employees know me just by my dog yes my dog who i have brought into this store several times they allow pets im assuming because ive never been asked to leave and ive seen others with their pets as well thats the best part about the store is the animal policy and the fact that they offer enough supplies for you to practically build a house some things are cost efficient while others are kinda breaking the bank there not as modern as lowes but they have alot of the same products i recently built my own in home bar ts  by  a long bar that i a girl built by hand im very proud of the work i did i installed lights and polished it and it has a resin top with ceramic tiles beneath it its a real beauty and i got all the supplies at home depot cost me about  to make but i put it together in  months so thats a plus but yea if your in need of some nice plants to go in the kitchen or patio or you just want to spruce up a few things around the house then this mega home repair store is where you ought to be between this and lowes its not like you have a choice|i made the rookie mistake of going to this home depot on a sunny afternoon on a saturday  enter pure chaos  for starters this parking lot is the worst  small spaces with large trucks squeezing in  seriously what were they thinking when they made these micro spaces  there were people in every which direction aimlessly and some pointedly criscrossing every aisle  i was able to ask two different employees for help but you have to grab them because theyre busythe checkout was even more insane  two lanes with actual employees and then the selfcheck out which really shouldnt even be a thing  you try scanning your own yard stick  yeah rightthis particular home depot is located just beyond penn circle in east liberty slibery and is off a oneway street  dont come here for a relaxing shopping trip  be prepared for insane parking lot wars and lots of chaos once inside  but if you live in the east end and need supplies this is probably your best bet|after several other trips to this home depot it is the closest option for me the service has been better it is still heavily dependant on the dayperson and there are lots of employees who dont know very much and still learning so have some patience when shopping here|fairly mediocre even by the relatively modest standards of home depot unfortunately this is probably the best youre going to do for hardware in most of pittsburgh|tried using the online order store pickup with the hopes of increased efficiency  fail|a few hours before the event we happened across the ad in the city paper and decided to give it a shot  we were excited to get there as the event said we would be making something there would be food and music demonstrations live music and a gallery  booking our reservations for pm was quick and easy over the phone  for a couple  upon arrival we checked in and were asked if we wanted to purchase another item to make we were confused because we assumed that we would each get to make something  in the end we chose not to spend the extra  to make another garden floatornament aka a hollow glass ball  when our instructor met with us he was very friendly but it was loud and he was very hard to hear  he ran through everything at lightning speed and in the end all we got to do was blow air in a tube for  seconds  had the first attempt not popped i wouldnt even have been able to do anything  from a teachers standpoint there were many other steps in the process that we should have been able to participate in i wouldve been happy to sign a waiver if that is part of the issue  within  minutes our ball was done and we were shuffled out so another couple could have their turnwe then worked our way downstairs to the food and drink and there was an assortment of beer wine sparkling juices veggies fruit cheese and some deli meats  the assortment was nice as we were able to snack on the healthy side but the beer was still warmthe gallery was nice to walk through with work on display from so many talented people the live music added to the ambiance and the demonstrations were interesting to watchin the end it was nice experience but were severely let down by the makeittakeit section of the evening the part we were most excited for  it really started to bug us when later in the evening we saw an older couple getting to do more of the steps in the process mind you we arent young kids but young professionals  we would have liked to have a small info talk about the steps that will take place why they are that way the tools used maybe some quick science behind it then get to work on the item|worst pizza ive had in pittsburgh i ordered from here last weekend the pizza pepperoni had no flavor and the crust was way too chewy the buffalo wings were cooked well and were tender and juicy but they had almost no sauce on them whatsoever luckily i had some wing sauce in my fridge in order to save them maybe it was one bad night and i can give them another chance later but based on my one experience i cant recommend this place to anyone|ahh the only place near the train station that is open past  pm isnt overpriced andor full of people who are way too jolly for such an early hour i got a slice of cheese pizza and onion rings the pizza was decent there was nothing flavorful about the sauce and the grease would not stop oozing out of the cheese i felt sick before i got halfway through it that reminds me  the slices are huge and are  the onion rings were extremely basic  i gave most of them to a couple of drunken girls who debated about what to eat for half an hourone irritating thing i overheard as a girl was trying to place an order the cashier kept interrupting her to say things like we dont have those anymore or no we cant cook wings dry sounds like the menu and staff needs to be updated|i had some pizza from pizza parma today during a lunch meeting at work  a colleague brought it in so i didnt pay for it and cant comment on the price  i had a few slices of the pepperoni pizza and found them to be resoundingly average  nothing special nothing especially good or bad  crust sauce cheese pepperoni fin  it was a little greasy and quite cheesy as well  i was starving so i really enjoyed it but i think overall the pizza is pretty generic  still for a late night slice or if you live nearby and just need to pick up a quick pizza for dinner id say go for it  just dont have very high expectations|i have lived in a townhouse that motheral owns for the past year and a half or so linda the property manager who just retired  thank god is the worst at first she was nice to us and was prompt with repairs and getting back to us  but towards the end of our lease she became extremely difficult to work with and wouldnt stop bothering us even after she had retired honestly she needs to get a life and stop bothering the tenants who are no longer her responsibility the only reason i gave them  stars is because the new property manager seems incredibly nice and i dont want to totally deter everyone just because of linda who was a bad seed its sad because this location is one of the best in shadyside to live  but god forbid you ask for reasonableness when it comes to certain issues|pizza parma has many of the characteristics i like in a pizza joint  they deliver when they say they will  diverse menu and toppings  coupons  online ordering and  take credit cards i think pizza parma shines with their specialty pizzas artichoke buffalo chicken spinach  feta and greek pies are all delicious ive also had some of their pasta dishes and i cant complain its nice to have something other than pizza delivered the portions are huge and they come with bread and a salad pizza parma fails on wings though the texture is unappealing aka flappy chicken skin yuk and the sauces lack depth desserts are also not worth the buy|i like the pizza and the selection of toppings  they are reliable  great option for take out food|this was one of first pizza places that ive tried inpittsburgh it was about  years ago i dont have a clear memory of that time but i have parma pizza phobia ever since so go figure|ive should have known better than to order a salad from a pizza joint  i also should have known that i shouldnt have cheated on my dieti figured id choose today to be my cheat day and order with everyone else at work for take out  i opted for the popcorn chicken salad  sounds tasty looked tasty and yes it even tasted tasty  iceberg lettuce grape tomatoes cucumbers red onions french fries popcorn chicken and three types of cheese  i have to say that even though i was saying yes my body was saying oh hell noim regretting this decision now as i am sitting here in discomfort  not sure what on the salad made me feel this way  but im not liking the effect im getting right now  could just be karma turning around and kicking me in the ass for eating what looked healthy but was really nothing more than the equivalent of a fried chicken sandwich combo meal from a fast food jointill think twice before the next time rolls around to order from here|three stars is super accurate for this place we decided to do take out from here after walking by it a hundred times after the gym and hearing radio commercials about it from that god forsaken bubba show does that plug raise anyone elses blood pressure our order was ready in  minutes speedy and we got a large  topping pizza for  and a side of fries all together like  for three people which is pretty good as for the pizza the crust was crispy and not too thick or thin and the sauce was sweet not seasoned i prefer a more herby sauce myself so i wasnt wowed by it the fries were a bit soggy but tasty overall if i were in a pinch id order from here no problem but its not a place id set out to order from because i love it|pizza parma delivers through grubhub which is the primary reason i ordered sandwiches from them bbq chicken was ok the bread is a little more on the burnt than toasted side leading it to be dry the value is good the  sandwich was about |great friendly service and my order was done fast which was amazing since i was a walkin lots of toppings piled high but i wish there was more cheese they did have small bottles of vanilla coke which is a rare find these days|if you find yourself craving pizza on a saturday night you cant beat  for a large cheese pizza i also enjoy the hoagies as they are lightly toasted for a nice crunchi cant speak for the pastas or appetizers but the pittsburgh style grilled chicken salad is a dependable choice|take out and delivery only good pizza and our goto for delivery love the hungry man special cheese pizza breadsticks hoagie and a two liter for  pizza is good cheesy and delicious i like the sausage pizza here as well the steak and meatball hoagies are our favorites service is fast and friendly|some friends and i ordered a couple of pizzas for delivery from here tonight  wed bought a few growlers of hard cider from a local establishment and we were looking for some fuel to help us soak up the booze  my friend suggested getting pizza from here and i didnt object since id never had pizza from here before and id heard the pizza from here was consistently decentthe pizza showed up about  min after we ordered it right about at the time estimated so no complaints there  as for the pizza itself it was solidly aoknothing special but nothing horrible either  it was a bit on the greasy side and i could tell from pulling the first piece away from the pie that the crust wasnt crispy  biting into my first slice of pepperoni pizza confirmed my suspicions about the floppiness of the crust  as for the flavor it was your standard pizza flavoragain nothing special but nothing horrible either  it was more greasy than id like but not to the point where i felt it necessary to dab off the grease with a napkin though i was tempted to do soas the bottom line the pizza was fine for our purposes to soak up alcohol it was better than vocellis and about on par with papa johns  i wouldnt go out of my way to order from here again but i wouldnt object to it either|this place is bright and clean and ive seen staff taking care of machines every time ive been there different timesdifferent days so i imagine its well maintained in general  love that there are bus stops directly in front of and across the street and that this is a hour place  i usually spend  every  weeks though i could probably get away with using the single load machines and a few minutes less in the dryer  i especially appreciate the good spin cycle from these washers as that means less time it has to be in the dryeraround here you can walk around the hood while waiting for your cycle to finish pizza place convenience store coffeeice cream shops next door borders bookstore down the block more shops on ellsworth nearbyim a female doing laundry for  so it takes a while to have enough for separate whitescolor load  ive also been to the laundry factory a few blocks away and i prefer econowash over the laundry factory|so unfortunately ive had to outsource my laundrydoing in the last couple of weeks because the dryer in my building has broken down and my notsoprudent landlord hasnt been helpful at all in repairs ugh twice in the last two weeks ive washed loads of laundry late at night and discovered my dryer hasnt worked its really great to know that this place is right down the street and is open  especially when the laundry factory down the street closes at about pm which in general i much prefer to this place but for conveniencesake i appreciate this place on the cons list its not incredibly clean and i have used dryers that simply dont work here|i think the only thing i appreciate about whole foods is entering the store and seeing their fresh cut flowers  lets see whyi attempt to drive to whole foods only to be caught in a line of  cars attempting to get into the parking lot  i guess im not cool enough to ride pat transit from the south pittsburgh home  when i find a place to park after the lexus suv ha pulls out i find that they didnt put their cart back  so i enter the store and admire how their design is very appealing to the eyes how do organic oranges get so round and so orange and everything is stacked so neatly  then i read that a pound of these oranges are   then i go to the meat section which i dont even eat to find that the prices are double those of trader joes or even market district see future review  so i walk around and debate to see if i should buy clif bars and naked juice which happens to be on sale because lord knows i dont need bulkblanchedalmonds  but then i decide to buy fresh chunky peanut butter because it would be fun to try  when i get home later however i bought valencia peanut butter whatever the hell that is and cannot stomach it  gimmie my jif  so while i am waiting in line i see the  bikes those rebellious urbanites moved from quiet storm and wonder if my money is better spent elsewhere  regardless i wholeheartedly no pun intended support organic and sustainable farming but id rather go to the farmers market or drive a bit further out of the city to go somewhere real to buy my whole food  and at least i put my cart back|i dont know maybe im not clear on the concept of whole foods  dont get me wrong theres nothing really wrong with shopping at whole foods  whole foods does have wonderful merchandise buti have found that i can buy a lot of the same organic things and environmentally safe cleaners at giant eagle for lessthier wine and beer selection supposedly quite remarkable in other states well remember this is pennsylvania  you cant buy those things at the grocery store  i can get just as good quality meat and produce in the strip district  sometimes even better qualityi guess the benefit of whole foods  is that you can find a lot under one roof and dont have to spend a lot of time and gas going to different stores  im not slamming whole foods at all but i actually like trader joes better|everybody chill out  this is a trendy place to shop yes but it also has better prices on some things than giant eagle or trader joes gasp  i split my time between here giant eagle and trader joes pretty evenly depending on what specialty items i might needoh yeah dont drive here  walk ride your bike or take the bus  if youre really smart youll avoid the headache and park on one of the many adjacent side streets|i loved whole foods in ohio  it was calm and quiet and had lots of pretty organic producehere  well first of all the parking lot is a deathtrap full of upscale suvs who have no idea how to drive courteously  a few pointers use your turn signals wait your turn drive slowly in a parking lot and put your cart back  my blood pressure skyrockets the second i even try to pull in heresecondly the whole store seems weirdly dark  i dont know if its the high exposedductwork ceiling or what but its depressingthirdly they offer plenty of bulk beans and nuts but few varieties of rice  there are a few good points though  the sushi at least the vegetarian varieties are good and the desserts are delicious and beautiful  the salad bar and prepared foods always look good and the staff is friendly  but i still try to avoid whole foods as much as possible simply because of the insane parking lot|whole paycheck is a fitting namethis whole foods is decent for regular items but their prepared food prices have gotten really high as of late  i used to shop here for almost everything but their common products can now be had at almost any other grocery store for lesswhole foods had its day as a unique place to shop with hard to find organic produce and products now its just more expensive|great selection of vegan vegetarian raw milk prepared foods bakery cheeses and aged beef very expensive trader joes and market district come to mind as a cheaper alternative parking at this particular store is a nightmare|i  like this whole foods for the most part  prices can be so so but the selection for unique items is great  however a lot of the organic items can now be found at many giant eagles for much less expense|mean customers aloof workersgood food  crazyofficial rant of an angry womanfirst off  i shop at whole paycheck cause my household eats organic and whether i like it or not wf has the best organic food prices in my neck of the woods its still god damn ridiculous expensive but i take my family units nutrition and health seriously worddownhill from herethe customers and parking lot are more bat shit crazy than mental hospitals ive worked ati have watched more rich bitch elderly women nearly murder pedestrians and crash into cars trying to park their lincoln continentals in that parking lot than id ever care to witnessalso  i am a mother with a young child and have been shoved by above mentioned rich bitches while reaching for products out of the freezer cases with my child in my arms i briefly entertained shanking said bitch but alas prison orange is not in my color wheelthe customers are the worst human beings on earth thinks about self shakes head laughsexcept me of course you know who you are shadyside hags you treat the employees like dogs  like one level above dirt if i worked there i would hang myself in the cheese section the customers are the worst cross section of pittsburghers ever that said i understand why the employees are like stunned fish  keeping things close to the vest so that rich bitch shadyside monsters dont feast on their flesh in fits of ragebut i would like to point outone female cashier who shall remain nameless shit on me and treated me like a tree killing whore when i handed her one internet print out coupon on a single sheet of computer paper  she rolled her eyes and painstakingly tore my coupon out of the paper and then folded the unused paper and placed it in her pocket i am a tree hugger getting judged by a tree hugger fukisuma you im a mom trying to do right for my family  feed them healthy go to hellif you see a woman and child dressed like rambo and baby rambo running through wf screaming and wielding gallons of milk  its me trying to survive another trip to whole paycheck hell| stars actually would be  but i had to knock off half a star because of the parking situation the lot sucks i used to work at whole foods and i can not recall how many times i almost got hit by a car when retrieving carts i am one of the lucky ones i know of a few people who werent so lucky im a huge fan of the salad and hot bar  not a fan of the price though to be fair i can only blame myself for ending up with an  salad but everything is so good and actually fresh i cant stop myself from piling it on the prepared sandwichs are pretty awesome too and if you go after p they are buy  get  i now work with a lot of children on special diets and i have no problem finding lots of gfcf treats for them here groceries range from expensive to moderate depending on the brand the wfms  line is an excellent bargain the bakery is full of tasty treats youve gotta try the pumpkin pumpkin pie though i believe it is only available around the holidays the whole store gets crazy busy on and around holidays|oh whole foods you are so so very overpriced  i so so wish you were not because i love the idea of the place  but i just cannot bring myself to do my normal grocery shopping here  i cant bring myself to spend the big bucksthe place is always packed and youre usually left bumping into people left and right  you may even get a nasty look yikes  the parking is atrocious with only probably only  spots for a pretty popular store  and have fun just getting into the parking lot from centre  okay im going to a negative place right nowi stop in here one a whim when im out in the area if im really craving sushi because its way better than the giant eagles sushi down the street  its still not he best fast sushi giant eagle waterfront but it does the job  again theyre almost  more than at ge  when i run in to grab sushi and usually ad odwalla by bill comes to almost   id rather eat a fast meal at qdobasorryi said itmy feelings can best be summed up with thishttpwwwyoutubecomwatchvufcpryuu|having just moved from austin where the original whole foods is located im not going to actually review this place for its selection or quality of food cuz lets face it how could i seriously compare this location to the original gigantic amazing fresh wonderful healthy gorgeous whole foods in austin instead ill limit myself on reviewing the ever so friendly staff and parking lot first the employees ive been to several whole foods around the country and i always got the impression that whole foods prides itself on customer service maybe this place is the exception i was shopping here yesterday and a lady kindly asked an employee if she could squeeze in behind his veggie cart to grab something the employee actually had the audacity to say when im done and he did just that he finished stocking his fruits and veggies and when he moved his cart and the lady thanked him he didnt say a word also the lady bagging my groceries didnt say one word to me not when i said hello not when i said thank you not even an ok when i said have a nice day she didnt even smile at me where is the love actually where are your manners  i dont need you to love me but dont be rude or ignore me second the parking lot im pretty sure this is the only whole foods in all of pittsburgh however the parking lot seems to be built for pittsburgh population  its a small lot  good luck finding a spot without creepily following someone to their car and fighting an suv for the spot luckily ive never truly had a problem parking because i go at off times and park farther away but im suspecting one of these days ill come out and find my car dented or scratched maybe by a car maybe by a shopping cartmaybe by the lady who was bagging my groceries yesterdayso two stars docked for the above mentioned  other than that ill keep shopping here  after all its not like i have another choice when it comes to the whole foods of pittsburgh|worst parking lot in pittsburgh bring popcorn to watch middleaged selfimportant mouth breathers gun their bmws at one another to illegally park in the handicapped spots if one didnt know better one could mistake the parking lot drama for a permanent outdoor performance art installation allbeit an extraordinarily douchey one snotty clientele over priced prepared items no longer have a monopoly on any product in pittsburgh that being said they do have a great selection of produce probably the best in pittsburgh but youll pay dearly for it  very large organic honeycrisp apple you ask try  for real if you want to sum up whole foods just remember its a place where you can literally spend  on an apple also the ceo john mackey voted for mitt romney httpwwwnytimescommagazinejohnmackeythekalekinghtmlr so if you think youre shopping in a mecca of neoprogressive preutopian bliss think again  waste of time and money overall|short and sweet and as a haikuparking is awfulno wine but thats pas faultbest organic food|i am a big fan of the whole foods company in general  the store back home omaha had a wine bar espresso bar gelato sushi and udon stand a giant cheese counter where you could samplei could go onthe pittsburgh whole foods is small and almost as overcrowded as its parking lot  twothirds of the time they are out of what i came for  im sorry but if im paying that much for groceries i want a stellar shopping experience  this wf is mediocre at best|i love the concept of whole foods but as everyone knows its pretty pricy  hence its nickname whole paycheck  nevertheless always great organic produce  the seafood and meat here are also the best  however this place is always packed  be prepared to be bumping into people and feel a little claustrophobic  the parking lot can be quite tricky as well as it can become completely full  they really need to add another location in the city of pittsburgh to take some stress off of this one|ill be honest i just dont get it  when it comes to eating i do not adhere to any particular mantra or dietary restriction like vegan organic vegetarian ethical etc  if its edible and its within my palates liking range then i eat itfrom that perspective this place just gets two stars  some items were higher priced but the value added from organic to vegan certified would i guess justify it if you had to have it  but the items that do no fall under any of those premiumrestriction value types are still just as highly priced  so it feels like  of their inventory is priced at a wholestore experience premiumtheir prepared meals section was marvelous and their cut fruit section was like i had died and gone to heaven  but thats about the only two sections i probably would have been willing to open up my wallet|no wifi  just fyi  when i lived in cleveland and my first truly terrible apartment had no wifi whole foods was my second homei would buy a little sampler of buffet foods and salads a coffee maybe a vegan cookie and park myself at a booth for an hour or more lets be real  after i taught a yoga class  i know i know im such a white liberal yuppie its painfulanyway so when the internet went out at my pittsburgh home i trotted off to whole foods bought some food and a coffeeand asked about the wifi  we have it said cashier   its probably just under whole foods  we have it said cashier  but i dont know the password  ask customer service  we dont have it said customer service go to starbucksbelieve it or not starbucks is letting me drink my coffee  eat my vegan cookie and didnt make me buy anythingno wifi  otherwise this whole foods is pretty good|this store is great  its got all of the fresh specialty items we need for cooking great weekend meals for friends but isnt a vast overpowering warehouse items are well organized and easy to find as others state it aint cheap one way we lowered our whole foods bill was to go for their  inhouse brand which is typically priced at the same pricepoint as similar items in the regular chain grocery stores we dont use whole foods for all of our supermarket needs just the specialty items great produce and seafoodi docked two stars for absolutely terrible parking  yep i know thats harsh but every time we come here we need to factor in another  minutes to get a parking spot and be able to leave safely there are always cars behind us looking for a spot when we are trying to leave and so we often cant just pull out of the space and leave quickly even being careful we have almost been hit multiple times by people losing their cool with the terrible parkingthat being said we will continue to come here to stock our home when we plan to entertain at home|this store is pretty good yes it is fairly expensive but you can get quite a few items that are difficult if not impossible to find at other stores they have a nice meat department with quite a few good naturally raised products particularly beef weve been very happy with their produce which we find noticeably better than trader joei wish it was bigger so there was a larger selection and a larger prepared food selection we are used to the larger stores in chicago also wish there was a liquor department but ill probably have to run for state office for that frankly the worst part is often parking dont know what causes everyone to behave badly in their lot myself included but man it can be a mess anyway well keep going at least for meats and produce|i think whole foods and giant eagle market district are competing for the title of most annoying place to shop it all starts with the parking experience which is ridiculously horrible at this location  very poorly planned and then theres the prices  giant eagle being quite expensive compared to similar grocers in other cities whole foods obviously has to get a one up on those its inherent in the scheme of selling premium natural goods whole foods does have better lighting and layout than ge and yes a more discriminative selection of products especially for people with specialized diets like vegans me and gluten free adherents the house baked bread here might be worse than ge tough contest  often under baked and thus soggy in middle and crusts tend to fall off making gluten freedom seem appealing and i dont even need to talk about customer demographics because youve all seen rachel cs link|i love everything that whole foods offers but i cant stand the experience of going there the parking lot is a mess of aggressive drivers acting like the extra  feet of walking will negatively affect the environment more than their driving around the parking lot until a better space opens up once you get a space and finally get inside the experience mirrors that of the parking lot everyone is in each others way and trying to be the first one to find the best organic orange or grab the last package vegan general tsos in the storeto be fair though the experience is still  times better than going to the market district a few blocks down the same street similar instore and inlot experience but with a better and higherquality selection the staff is always really nice and super helpful and their trays of fruit and veggies are excellent weve ordered them countless times for parties and have never been let down pricey but excellent quality the prepared foods are delicious and their prepackaged prepared foods are also really goodbut like nearly everything else in whole foods a little pricey for example their yummy tomato bisque is  hardly cheap enough for a quick lunch but it is yummy their baked goods are delicious as well were constantly picking up bread from there and the occasional doughnut and were never disappointedtheir meats and seafoods departments are also excellent they have a great variety and are always helpful in answering any questions that ive had although we still opt for our meats from djs of course if youre at whole foods youre likely there for the organic options and as to be expected youre not going to find a better selection anywhere else more unique perhaps but their inventory just wont be matched any time soon for those foods surprisingly thirdparty  prepackaged pricing is actually onpar with giant eagle so whenever were looking for those types of items milkeggspastas etc we always opt for whole foods|i have only come to this whole foods a couple times since moving to pittsburgh in  however now that i have discovered that i have some food allergies i may be coming here more oftenpros high quality unique products especially for those with particular dietary restrictionscons terrible parking lot crowded store high pricespersonally i buy specialty items but wouldnt purchase all my groceries from here i cant yet afford that luxury|ok so this is my first visit to whole foodsever  and now i know why it has taken me so long  much like the parking lot the inside of the store is just as congestedi came here with only two things in mind that i needed i went to the aisles i assumed they would have been in and we all know the saying there  for as small as the store is you would have thought i would have bumped into a staff member  i was again wrong there  i scanned and scanned and scanned the aisles until i found the two items i needed and wouldnt you know right after i did i came across a staff member  after being run over by a stroller on my way to the registers i was happy to head back out and fight the congestion in the parking lot|i shop at whole paycheck from time to time but i find them much too expensive for everyday groceries  if i want to splurge once in a while or buy something to take to a party its definitely the place to go  the cheese counter is extensive but i dont like that they precut their cheeses i much prefer the way penn mac handles their cheeses and does not cut until you order  whole foods will gladly do the same so make sure you request that  i love the produce and the prepared foods  i just wish they would give us a break on the prices|so when i think about shopping at whole foods i always create an alternate universe where i think i would be able to shop here i think if i made at least twice the amount of money i currently do i would be able to be a member of the club and shop here  but i dont thus i only stop in here on very special occasions when i  can withstand the rage i feel when i pull into this parking lot and  i want to either eat at the buffet or buy a very specific item i would definitely recommend that others stop in sometime to get some food at the buffet the quality of everything is pretty incredible though of course its typically really expensive|my expectations for whole foods market had been established as was growing up in the dmv dc md va area thus very fresh produce highquality meats diverse cheeses expansive bulk section novel food items exceptional food bars and excellent customer service were essentially a given on the other hand i also expected parking difficulties even at stores with multistory garagesthe whole foods market in pittsburgh is not much different from those in the dmv area however the parking is horrendous really a mediumsize private parking lot for the only whole foods market in the pittsburgh area right along a congested major road let me say that whole foods markets in dc are also close to major roads but they at least have underground or aboveground garages and fairly decent road infrastructure to accommodate for the influx and outflux of shoppers i would love if the pittsburgh store can build a garage of some sort im not counting the garage next to the starbucks and walgreens with smooth entry and exit so as to prevent a minigridlock along centre avenueparking situation aside the pittsburgh store does live up to my expectations established from the dmv stores you will rarely find a bad apple no pun intended and the store usually keeps shelves stocked except when there is a major sale or promotion going on now if only its prices and my budget could meet halfway so i could frequent this store morevia bike or my own two feet|i will start by saying this review is for the hot bar and i must of gone at an off hour for the hot bar and by that i mean during the dinner rush before they replenished it i would say everything i got from the salad bar to the hot bar was good apart from they had run out of soupspecial of the day and the chicken was beyond dry the time i spent in the dessert was a wet oasis compared to the chicken i just feel that for the price i paid it was not worth it i have been to a smaller whole foods with a better hot bar and to the one in new york city and remember it being great i only give this one  stars because the mac n cheese and vegan tofu loaf was rather good but i must repeat myself about the price for what i got its way to much its hard to justify paying that much when i could make it for th the price at home now i know i dont have to cook or clean and thats the point of eating out but i could also go to trader joes get a few frozen meals and eat for over a day for the price of one hot bar meal from whole foods|i seriously dont know where to begin oh yes i shall start ladies do not ever go there hungry or on your period that has your horns out due to the most beautiful thing we get cramps first off the parking will make you want to rip your steering wheel apart and throw it at the person ahead of you that got the last parking space parking is madnessthen after you find a parking spot from doing bumper cars with other nondriving asses here comes another traffic jam carts and people the space in there is one big box geez louise i cringe when i have to go there to get an item that only wf carries but i like how they trap me with their delicious fruit and vegetable display as soon as you walk in its a war zone in that area i can understand organic being more expensive than conventional but why oh why is their conventional just as expensive as their organic really so every time they get me with their fruits veggies and the only place that i have found to sell skinless drumsticks along with  or  more items my bill is always  omg i only got  bag of groceries the fruit that sells by the pound be like  to  dollars i just cant on a more positive note the employees they have always been so great to me always greet me with a smile and if i have an item that has a coupon they go out of their way to get the coupon so i can save lol at save oh my haha but yeah the employees must be getting paid good because they smile and always happy to help me|i know what whole foods has done for the area and for that im forever grateful  they came into a dicey neighborhood and brought their awesome healthy food and fun staff and east liberty blossomed around it  but that parking lot  good lord its like playing bumper cars  and from the youtube video where the guy sings its getting real in the whole foods parking lot i realize that pittsburghs whole foods is not special  this is a common problem  small spaces not enough parking too many people driving through fighting for a spot yeah its a messits almost always crazy busy in here  i believe id come more often if the shopping experience was calmer  but because of the insanity of the parking lot and the hectic shopping people everywhere bumping into each other  that takes place inside i truly limit my shopping here  to like once a year but when i do venture in i think they have a fab hot food section and great sushi  some pretty tasty baked goods as well|i have such mixed emotions about whole foods i first visited whole foods in february of this year in my opinion it is a little overwhelming at first and heres why like most people in the us i was brought up on all of the typical mainstream american food brands so when i walked into this place and barely recognized any brands it was slightly overwhelming it took a little research and i still do some research on some products before making a trip i recommend going online and checking their coupons before making a trip  i tried a bunch of new products that way i have also googled best snacks at whole foods to get some more ideas of what to try now heres the sucky part overall whole foods is pretty overpriced but i will say that it is not entirely their fault they sell higher quality products than your average grocery store mostly all of their products are made with the best ingredients and are often organic and gmo free they are vegan and vegetarian friendly and have tons of options for people with allergies if companies are spending more money on better ingredients  they are going to have to sell their products for a higher price having said that tazo tea for  a box is not a sale i went a couple weeks ago and saw the sale price advertised did a quick google search and realized target sells their tazo tea for  not on sale needless to say i took the trip down the street and saved myself some money for the tea i also recently wanted to purchase kale chips that i heard so much about brand is called brads raw and the flavor was vampire killer until i realized they were  for  oz  you can get fresh kale for less than half the cost although whole foods can be expensive they arent always that bad my favorite yogurt wallaby organic yogurt is sold here on a normal day it cost  each a couple days ago they were  cents each not bad for organic yogurt they also have an amazing selection of uniquely flavored chocolates and they are pretty reasonably priced justins organic peanut butter cups are incredible the customer service has  always been awesome in this particular location i hear that whole foods is very willing to take back anything that you dont enjoy  as long as you have your receipt as other yelpers have said the parking sucks in this location its a nightmare so keep that in mind before you visit overall when i want to treat myself a little i come to whole foods|every once in a while when im feeling particularly flush i battle the evil that is the wf parking lot i tell myself it will totally be worth it in order to class it up with some high quality goodies  the fish and meat selection are out of the park when it comes to freshness  however ive purchased flowers twice and each time they were dead by day three  both times i allowed the molten flowers to remain on the counter an extra day to serve as a reminder why im not wf material|the parking lot is always a zoo and that alone will give me a bit of anxiety if i think of going to whole foods people get pretty crazy driving around in that lotlike mean and roadragey yes this place is more expensive and that keeps me from shopping there on the regular its always packed when i go in as well what i do like about them is the selection of flowers i dont always buy but its nice availability of very specific items great selection of all kinds of foods and a nice area of prepared food if you want to take something to go or eat there its a clean store and the employees are nice i find its easy to navigate its definitely a good place if youre trying to find items for a recipe you dont usually make like meboursin garlic herb cheese i found it here its vegan and vegetarian friendlyboth of which i am not but still a great option for other individuals i will say again the parking lot keeps me away a lot though if you happen to score a sweet spot its a great idea to peruse the aisles and you may just find something new to check out for a lower price|overpriced and overwhelming i made the mistake of going  once on a weekend never again the parking lot felt like i was in a david fincherdirected game of frogger its always always so congested and busy and filled with entitled customers i was checked into a magazine rack once when a guy tried to beat me to a checkout lane some of the fresh stuff is nice but its definitely not worth the anxiety attack|ive been to many whole foods market particularly in ca i was really excited having a whole foods market near my apartment however i am really disappointed with this location the deli premadesalad barhot bar selection is limited and the food is subpar the parking lot is teeny tiny if i had a choice i would go to the wexford location  definitely should stop by if youre in the area|when i travel for work i often stop at whole foods to pick up prepared meals  i know that i will get a good lunch or dinner and the price is comparable to most upscale fast food options    a few weeks ago i was really sick and came in to pick up a cold remedy lunch and orange juice  this whole foods is just not quite up to the national standardfirst this whole foods is fairly small but the parking situation is a disaster  there is not adequate parking and the kind of people who shop at this particular whole foods are the worst people ever  people will try to run you over in the parking lot to get the last spot  its actually patheticthe store is setup a bit odd and the employees arent particularly friendly here  i felt like i was begging someone to find sambucus which just isnt fun when you dont feel well  however the cashiers were up to parthe biggest kick in the face was the prepared foods section  at  am on a thursday there was no prepared food set up  no soup no entrees  just some leftover oatmeal that had hardened from breakfast and the name tags for the prepared food that would eventually come out  there are only two small serving stations as well and a lot of my favorite options were missing like the mac and cheeseif you are just looking to do standard grocery shopping here then this whole foods is just fine  the grocery selections were pretty standard and the aisles are wide enough  this whole foods is a big step up from the gross market district down the street but the standard is pretty low here as well|maybe im just not the kind of person that likes whole foodsi dont mind paying a bit more for quality groceries but the east end food coop is a bit cheaper in my opinion for the same products  the store itself is very very hard to navigate it seems to always be super crowded  ive never used a buggy only a basket and even trying to maneuver that is a nightmare  in my opinion theres just too much going on in the space that they have food displays at the ends of aisles sample tables seated tables at the frontand no room to actually shop  either someones in your way or youre in their way  the parking lot welli feel the other reviews have that covered|i in theory love whole foods i love the produce selection the cheeses and the meats the hot bar is lovely and the bakery pretty good when i moved to pittsburgh i was elated to finally have a whole foods i could shop at but the experience is just unpleasant humans in bmwsaudisbeat up subarus have turned into vultures circling waiting for the next spot to open up in the impossibly tiny lot there are no words to describe the anguish of being stuck behind one of these vultures stalking a shopper with a full grocery cart only to see a spot just ahead that someone else pounces on while you helplessly look on it sounds trivial and i get that this is a city but is this what one really wants to deal with as they are trying to run errands on their day off when there are other less stressful options near by and you know i think the trauma of trying to find a parking spot remains with the shoppers long after parking their car because people the atmosphere is kind of stressful inside as well the jockeying for the shortest line in the check out the pushing people out of the way for the last organic horseradish root its about the same as any other urban grocery store but after the parking knowing the dangerous gauntlet i must run to get back to my car with my groceries the prices its just not worth it and id be willing to forgive all of this if it were an above average whole foods but its not this brings me at last to the turkey i called ahead in late october twice to make sure the turkey i ordered would be fresh for thanksgiving it was supposed to be fresh it was labelled fresh but it was frozen if im going to pay  bucks for a bird it really should come as labeled and advertised i dont need the stress of hoping my bird will thaw before the big day spoiler alert it wont especially not after the parking lotedit well customer service was awesome and they refunded my frozen turkey i amend to  thanks customer service|i called the office to get a lightbulb replaced one of their maintenance staff took pictures inside my apartment without my knowledge or permission apparently my dog not being in his crate while i was not home was not up to franklin wests standards so they sent me a letter including the pictures that were taken without my knowledge  after receiving their threatening letter reminding me of the lease i regretfully signed my fianc called them to ask why  they were taking pictures inside our apartment without our knowledge they said they can enter our apartment any time they like which apparently means they can photograph your things as well if you have pets dont even bother renting from any of their properties pet depositrent is ridiculous i get harassed that my dog needs to be crated when im gone oh they even suggested i put my baby in doggy day care how the  am i supposed to afford that when im paying a security deposit pet deposit rent and pet rent ive basically been told im not getting my security deposit back  their reasoning that my dog has to be crated is for the safety of their maintenance guys my dog is a  lb papillon one of the pictures they sent me while they decided to do a photo shoot inside my apartment was of my dog laying down on the bed very vicious indeed im scared to even be in my own home now thats not a life im comfortable with especially because my dog is a registered emotional companion dog that my doctor and vet each sent letters to franklin west stating that yet is still considered a threat six months left on my lease wish me luck guys ps if you do go into their leasing office you will see one of the employees dog roaming around while mine is locked in a crate do they not see the hypocrisy|jimmy tsangs chinese restaurant is one of the old traditional pittsburgh restaurants a place you remember as always being there  my parents feel the same way about it  it is a good if unspectacular place with reliable tasty fare like honey chicken chinese flank steak and authentic eggrolls  i dont normally go for the spicy fare indeed i prefer the plainer dishes like chicken with vegetables but they have one item on the menu that ive always wanted to trysau la gi which is stirfried hot spicy chicken onions green onions  fresh bean sprouts  perhaps ive never noticed but i dont recall seeing it anywhere else  it was good but hooboy did i have to pace myself while eating it  and have plenty of water nearby  sau la gi was worth trying once but it really wasnt to my tastes and i doubt ill have it againmy friend maryann tried  ching za gai spicy also which is roasted crispy chicken served with tangy vinaigrette sauce  i sampled it and perhaps i will order that for myself next time  id like to cook a milder version of it myself at home  more to my tastes however are the garden chicken chicken with broccoli or beef with pea pods  seafood dishes include sweet and sour shrimp and  sauteed shrimp szechaun style  yeah im a little unimaginative when it comes to chinese food but i know what i like and if a place can do the basics right its okay in my bookjimmy tsangs also has a convenient and inexpensive lunch menu  the place also does korean barbecue and you can book a private dining room for you and your special someone with a  deposit|hey jimmy cigarettes are not a replacement for tea bags the early bird special is cheaper because it is mostly cabbage and the tea tastes like secondhand smokei had the same dish previously without the special and it was fine hence  stars and not  im going to avoid this place until i get a craving to drink tobacco|walking into jimmy tsangs was like walking into the chinese restaurant that was on hawaii five  it puts you back in time to the s and the food is reminiscent of that era alsohot  sour soup was highly americanized not very hot or very sourwonton soup was a very large portion and goodegg rolls were large slightly greasy but the filling was flavorless not very goodcheese wontons were okay but the old grease used to fry them in overpowered the flavorchinese flank steak was tough and chewy in a soy style sauce thickened with cornstarch a little too salty and greasy but overall it was goodflaming chicken was chicken breast with sugar peas bamboo shoots and baby corn in a whiteclear cornstarch chicken base sauce that lacked much of any flavor except slat  it was just okaytea tasted like american lipton brewed in large quantities in the back than served in a generic teapotthe place was clean service was good prices are very good but the food was just average|went there last night with  peeople there was another  people partythe food was good  not great but good we waited  minutes for the first dish to arrive and that only because we sent one of our folk to see what was going on they did bring drinks and tea promptly|i was expecting a lot more from jt but realized that it is a restaurant that serves both chinese and korean but not in a fusion type of way it merely has a chinese menu and a korean menu the idea was cute they even have typical chinese lunch specialsthe deco needs upgrading and dusting  some lighting or even natural light its like walking in a cave and some other reviews were right that it has a hint of smoke in the air i had a craving for comfort food and ordered jajangmyeon and grilled calamari the tea and water was served as i sat down i went a little after the lunch rush so there was not too many people the calamari came out promptly and the jajangmyeon took a little longer the portions were huge what took the longest and annoyed me the most i was the only one left at the restaurant was waiting for the check why does waiting for the check take  minutes they never came the clear the table or walked by so that i could signal that i needed the check i should have just walked out the food was okay but i seriously needed to get in and out of there in a certain time frame that they didnt help with you may want to consider going when you have a  hour lunch break|yep closed  my dad and i were gonna come here dinner last night  he called me and told me to meet him at china palace instead  so long jummy tsangs  you were one of the last of the old time chinese joints|after a long day of recruiting at cmu i arranged a dinner for  people here in casbah prefix menu over all the experience was okbreak downscallops  appetizer  i had high expectation but it came out a bit too over spiced  very rich i am glad they only gave me two  fillet mignon  entree  very tender piece of meat but no wear near as good as some of the places here in the silicon valley or even some of the chain steak places like mortonsdessert  the highlight of the of the meal  mango panna cotta with some sorbet  it was amazing  the consistency of the panna cotta was perfect  it wasnt too dense or too liquidybeing a big burrito restaurant i expected more but it was good nonetheless|so i went back to casbah for dinner and was totally underwhelmed the granola i had for brunch in my previous review was better than my entire dinner put together the service was better at dinner then at brunch but the food made my rating drop from five stars probably a little generous to three stars definitely go for brunch but its not worth the money for dinner mediocre food in a nice atmosphere with good service is still mediocre food|meh  seriously  mediterranean  what  sorry but just because you serve scallops on babah ganoush doesnt make your restaurant mediterraneanthis was kind of a disappointment if you couldnt tell by my sarcastic tone  the food was good and i had a great time but the food lacked the final eyebrow raising component that you come to expect with the bill that followsthat said the wine list was good and the prices were reasonable relative to the food  get the cheese course for dessert and youll go home happy|i really wanted to like casbah after checking out the menu online  i really wanted to like casbah once i saw the super cool dark interior of the restaurant  unfortunately everything started to go down hill from therethe waiter was less than helpful suggesting a wine to accompany our dinner which i found to be a bit odd at such a nice restaurant  my friend and i order split the tuna tartare and the fennel salad to start  the tartare was decent but it lacked seasoning and i wasnt into the creme fraiche on top  the salad was ok but nothing to rave about  i had the short rib ravioli after reading the reviews on yelp but i didnt like the sauce that accompanied it  my friend ordered the risotto with oyster mushrooms and she was also less than enthuseddont get me wrong nothing about my meal was terrible but nothing about my meal was spectacular either   it looks like maybe i should have tried brunch  we shall see if im willing to give casbah another chance|out of the big burrito group not counting mad mex this is probably the biggest disappoint of their chain and this is just not a one time bad experience i have been here three times and have been less than enthused with the food vs pricevalueservice has always been good and attentive i enjoy their wines and the selections but on almost every dish there is something is either wrongly out of place or i expected much better for the money i am paying for examplesumac scallop appetizer cooked perfectly but the tartness of the sumac was not there the other thing is i can brown a scallop at home in a restaurant i am looking for a perfectly cooked scallop that has a nice caramelized sear on it almost crunchy top juicy center also why so stingy with the baba ghanoush  tsp come on eggplant is that expensiverisotto  over cooked not even a little bit of toothiness to the grain plus it was pretty devoid of flavor but seemed to have had the addition of cream and butter to make it creamyduck entre again duck was perfectly cooked quince jus was nice not overly sweet but the faro did not compliment the dish at all i even had a dining companion taste the combination and asked if they like it and they said it didnt gopasta entre with spinach this could have been good but spinach was not washed and had grit in it this item was returned and a braised lamb dish was ordered in its place the lamb was slightly undercooked read just a little tough and jus that went with it was very wateryif this was some little bistro where i was paying  for dinner no drinks i wouldnt be so picky but some of my meals have been north of  and for that amount of money i expect a little more attention to detail|i was determined to let this one pass experience was not worth commentary until i made a disturbing discoveryi made a reservation for inside they sat us outside that turned out to be preferable to us because the tables that were available inside were very close to others the patio was spacious and decorated with busts slightly preferable to the inner cheaptrendyinteriorscom shit have you seen the terrible bathroom wallpaper borders probably not as the ladies room is a very dim place dont expect to be able to notice that your botox implant is crooked anyway it was hot under the spaceray heater on the patio making for a sweaty and iceinstantlymelted beverage winter night the food was alright with some interesting flavor pairings but it was certainly not quite worth the price the bread was the best ive had in pittsburgh our server made it seem that everything she was doing was somebody elses job in fact it was mostly other people who delivered which made it confusing in terms of knowing who to ask for things and whether or not to factor some of the fine service into the tip that presumably goes mostly to the primary server who was subpar for upscale dining our question for the kitchen left unanswered the host is supposed to do that but i will run on when i described the qualities i was looking for in my wine choice during beverage inquiry she just stared blankly and waited for me to decide the wine list did not include descriptions the gal who delivered the wine thankfully did describe it before popping the top and it was determined that i did not want this cheapest option before me she described another bubbly that sounded and was according to my own tastes delightful i was so very satisfied with the sparkling sensation of the meal that i sought it out at the wine and spirits store this was the moment that my minor disappointment in the value of my specialoccasion dinner at casbah turned into a feeling of devastating violation i am talking about a  markup on the retail price of this wine if you want to do your own math at casbah the  bottle of gruet blanc du noirs cost  while a whole bottle at ws is priced at  you can bet that i will choose to enjoy this wine elsewhere like avenue b byob next time casbah is lacking the quality service honesty and original ambiance that should accompany creative food at moderately high pricesupdate i recently saw a full size bottle of the gruet on a restaurant menu for  casbah take a tip|very tasty food and drinks its a little pricey but worth it if you want something better than a typical chain|the interior is very nice the food is a hit or miss we went for brunch today you can select a drink alcoholic or non an appetizer and a brunch entree for the price of  the appetizers we had pollenta and squashchestnut soup were very good the entrees on the other hand left a lot to be desired we got the mushroom omelet and jumbo lump crab and tomato omelet the omelet was very bland it did not have much flavor and needed seasoning and more ingredients than just eggs basically i have had better omelets at some dennys my drink mimosa was just ok my girlfriends blood mary was delicious though  uniquely spicy i have been to casbah  times last time being for brunch today the first time it was good worthy of  stars it gradually went down to  stars the wine selection is good but the food is definitely hit or miss once i had a halibut that smelled like the ocean it was not well cooked or fresh or something consistency is the key in a nice restaurant casbah leaves much to be desired in this regard|disappointing my bf and i went for just dessert and wine which we told the hostess ahead of time the waitress was very curt and disrespectful we were rushed to order even though there were plenty of empty tables and it was not closing time she did not offer suggestions or advicewe ended up ordering the flourless chocolate cake the cake was extremely rich but delicious and the portion was just right for sharing after dinner the marscapone was silky and paired perfectly with the cherries on topthe waitress kept coming back to see if we were done and ready for our check after we got the check she was in a hurry to get us out the door i am completely dissatisfied with the service and will not go back to this restaurant simply because of it|i have to agree with the hit or miss reviewers about casbah at least when it comes to the food i came here for brunch last weekend with a big group they were very accomodating to us throughout the reservation process and the brunch which was good and our waiter daniel was great the previous reviewer who said the bloody mary is the best drink was spoton it had a great spice and was the only drink that seemed like it had any alcohol in it at all the mimosa and sangria were very eh i loved my smoked salmon appetizer and that did seem to be the hit at the table but entrees around the table left people disappointed the goat cheese and mushroom omelette could have had a heckuva lot more goat cheese and mushrooms and my scallopsausagegritsegg dish just had way too much going on the grits were actually fabulous but the scallops were overcooked and got lost next to the scrambled eggs  and sage sausage crumbles if i lived in pittsburgh i could see myself coming back here for wine and appetizers but im not sure i would make it a regular brunch or dinner spot|not impressed at all my bf n i went and had dinner for my birthday there our waiter was rudelooked tired n sloppy like she didnt want to be at work she rolled her eyes whenever we need assistance n rushed us threw our menusthe food was good but nothing amazing|casbah is more like a  but i rounded down  we arrived after happy hour at soba apparently owned by the same people for dinner  there were four of us and they started us out with delicious drinks  i had the margarita topped with malbec which was surprisingly yummy for appetizers we tried the meatballs and the grilled trip of flatbreads with mediterranean dips  for mains i had the rare seared tuna andrea had the salmon and allejandro and elie both had the gnocchi  everything was ok to start and the mains were all good although they rely heavily on butter and huge portions for their mainstay of flavor and satisfaction  it was interesting to have such big portions after nyc where im used to portion control but i decidedly prefer more reasonable portions maybe somewhere in between all in all a nice garden pleasant and a good place for conversation|had a very lackluster mothers day brunch at casbah yesterday despite having a very late reservation time of  pm we were seated in the dungeonlike basement dining room i asked for tables upstairs in the daylight but there was allegedly no way to accommodate my request worst part about the basement is the thumping from the subwoofer located above  really ridiculous service was fine timing of drinks and first brunch course were acceptable given it was a busy day but then gap of  minutes for entrees left us all sitting there not enjoying the dark of the basement nore the perpetually thumping base an utterly forgettable mothers day brunch luckily she took it in stride but i think casbah will not be at the top of the list in my book for quite awhile|i came here with a friend for her birthday and the food really isnt particularly special  portions are decent and i guess the prices are reasonable if they had better food the outside of restaurant makes me think that the inside will be just as square and boring but the inside patio area was pretty nice actuallyoverall i just wasnt very impressed with the food  if i was offered to eat this food for free sure id take a helping but probably not seconds|i finally went to casbah for brunch today rolled in at am to meet a handful of people because it is labor day weekend the place was empty except for a woman who had just gotten there too which was nice because a friend had warned me that the place gets crazy we sat outside and atmosphere was cozy under the tent with the warm colors of the decor our waitress was incredibly friendly and presented us with the menus i think it is great they have a prix fixe brunch   alchy or nonalchy drink an appetizer and an entree  but for  it looks like they have since raised the prices since miles o went i felt it was just a tad steep and a lot of food but took the plunge anyway i ordered the smoked salmon for the appetizer and the mushroom omlette for my entree and had a hot coffee they did not have ice coffee though offered to put ice with hot coffee if i wanted it the waitress brought out some delicious mini baked treats before we got our dishes  poppy scone on the crispier side but delicious blueberry muffins and biscuits which were all buttery goodness after eating these i was getting a little full and then after my appetizer i realized i probably should not have gotten the prix fixe but could have would have should have i ended up boxing half of my omlette entree portions were large atmosphere was cool food was good and wait staff were awesome but in the end i dont think  not including the tip and tax was worth it|um  a little bummed  i had high expectations but left feeling justmehthe restaurant is really cool looking but i was a little confused by the bar set up  we sat at the bar because they didnt have any tables open  i usually dont mind sitting at the bar but the stools are bolted to the floor and about  feet from each other  if you have three people with you forget about mingling  also the service was very iffy  there was a bartender and then a server for the bar area or what it seemed like  the bartender got us our drinks but never told us a server would be with us  i figured she was our server too  but then some other woman came up to us all flustered  she never introduced herself just asked what we wanted and kept saying okay okay okay  just very odd  it continued that way the entire timei tried the prix fixed brunch for  which includes your choice of an alcoholic bevvie bloody mary sangria or mimosa appetizer and main course  i had the mimosa that was the perfect mix splash of oj polenta and eggs beni  the cinnamon polenta which was delish light fluffy and warm with dried fruit and almonds on top  i loved itthe eggs beni with smoked salmon  it was just okay  i kept trying to think pf what was missing and i believe it was that the hollandaise sauce had no real taste  i expect hollandaise sauce to be rich and creamy this was thin and blah  i definitely want to go back and try the dinner see if maybe ill have a little better luck  so kick it up a notch casbah youve been around for a while but i still expect good food|passed this restaurant for years on my way to buffalo blues or more recently mad mex but have never actually eaten here  having finally come for lunch i overall enjoyed it but it had some ups and some downs  i ordered the piccola gusto menu which for me included the cream of cauliflower soup the orecchiette pasta and the roasted turkey sandwich  it sounds like a lot of food but the pasta serving is mini and its a half sandwich  for me the size was just right  the soup was awesome and i could have eaten an entire lunch of just it  the pasta was a little too creamy for me and just didnt have enough seasoning or spice  i did love the addition of the cranberries in it though  the perfect amount of sweet to offset the cream  the roast turkey sandwich was just that  not out of this world but not bad  my biggest complaint was the service  it took a really long time to get our meals which is always a bad thing during a weekday lunch  id like to go back here for a happy hour when its warm so i can enjoy the covered patio though and a nice glass of wine|you know whats good tomatobasil soup with cream in it  and even better finding a way to eat on the patio in january where the dining room at casbah is intimate and warm the patio is bright open and shielded from the elements the waitstaff was friendly and helpful and the lunch specials were actually special  good flavor slightly indulgent but you dont leave feeling overstuffed i want to eat my way through the menu|my husband and i went to casbah to celebrate my birthday one evening  we were seated on the patio which was fine before a party of  was seated with a  year old who was banging his silverware on the table all night  so much for romantic  ever hear of a babysitter  anyway ambience aside lets get to the food which overall i would give a c  we started with the veal and pork meatballs which were the highlight of the meal  the perfect blend of sweet fresh tomato sauce and spicy  the meatballs had a nice tang and the polenta was delicious albeit there wasnt much of it there  we each then had the heirloom tomato salad which was tasteless  i grow heirlooms and know the intense and wonderful flavor they should have these tasted like a grocery store tomato bought in december  very disappointing  i opted for the cavatelli entree which was not prepared as described on the menu  it was swimming in tomato sauce and overall was very bland  another disappointment  my husband had the pork chop which wasnt bad but certainly didnt leave us wanting to return here for the food  all this said the service was professional we enjoyed the drinks he had the sangria and i their house cosmopolitan and had a lovely bottle of wine  i might return here for happy hour but it was not the right choice for a romantic special occasion dinner  and we had the decency to hire a babysitter for our children otherwise we would have stayed home| sat outside on patio metallic chairs and tables when we made reservation expecting to sit in the restaurant not outside there was no information about this if the restaurant inside seats g is full then they should mention to the customers making reservations that they will be sitting outside food is mediocre at best they even screwed my order asked for risotto and got some pasta not sure what asked for two cabs someone at restaurant changed it to one big cab instead which could not hold all of us so we had to wait for another  mins for another one would not recommend to anyone enough other good restaurants in pittsburgh to go to they have to have paid their way into magazines rating them highly|sharia dont like it and neither does becky boy and i went to casbah on a warm tuesday evening the restaurant wasnt busy and we were seated in the inviting outdoor patio our waitress was very pleasant and extremely informative about both the drink and food menus we shared a bottle of mission la caminade malbec french this was a very good mediumbodied wine many yelpers have raved about casbahs bread and pesto i dont get it ive had much better sourdough elsewhere and the pesto wasnt anything to write home about i had the asparagus soup with crab for an appetizer  the soup was served cold and tasted fresh enough but something was off and i barely ate half of it i ordered the orecchiette pasta as an entree which was served with grilled chicken and cranberries in a goat cheese cream sauce i am upset to report that this tasted rather bland the cranberries were the only spark of flavor in the dish  boy ordered the ricotta cavatelli pasta which was in a marinara sauce with sausage and ricotta i am sad to report that this too was tasteless the ricotta was dumped on top and added nothing to the dish we glanced at the dessert menu after spending so much on food we didnt enjoy boy and i decided to cross the street for ice cream instead overall casbah has a nice atmosphere and service but their food quality doesnt match the price tag|i came here a year ago and had a really awesome meal  id say the best in pittsburgh id had since arriving  given that we went here for a birthday dinneroverall we were all left with kind of a meh experience  our server seemed pretty disinterested and slow  i think the low point was someone ordered a steak medium rare for   what came out was a well done and cold piece of meat  it looked like a hockey puck when he sent it back no apologyand no change in the bill  i at least expected a manager or someone to come out and apologize and say weve taken it off the bill or something  nope  he sat there watching the rest of us finish our entrees before his replacement steak arrivedthe rest of the entrees were good and i would go back  but probably with lowered expectations|i had a free entree from big burrito for my birthday for which we decided to use at casbah a few weeks ago it was my first time there though ive tried a few other bb restaurants in the past food  cracked pepper butter was delicious  i had to warn the waitress not to let me have any more bread and ruin my meal grilled bruschetta ricotta fava beans swiss chard  preserved lemon arugula chervil calcagno was a bit too lemony for my liking short rib raviolli short rib ravioli swiss chard oyster mushrooms roasted shallots gremolata was very savory and i would definitely order it again doublecut pork chop with braised kale prosciutto  parmesan risotto garlic cream sage jus was joes meal i tasted a bit of everything and really enjoyed the kale i like really really creamy risotto and this wasnt quite there i dont want to say it was undercooked as i like i just like mine overcooked fried apple empanadas vanilla bean cider reduction toasted oat streusel  caramel ice cream the ice cream was great but the empanadas were bland to meservice not terrible i understand at nice restaurants people enjoy taking their time to relax enjoy their meals and converse with their dinnermates but our server should have been more observant to the fact that we would be just sitting there with empty places waiting for the desert menu i will note though that the table next to us returned two glasses of the same wine and the bartender came over and very politely suggested an alternative wine for the patron they were very accommodating in this way will i go back someday  but i think i may try soba or kaya first|im actually giving it  stars   for the appetizers and  for the entrees  my wife and i went to casbah for the first time  as we usually do we decided to share our entrees tip  you can get half portion sizes of the pastas and augment the meal with a few appetizers  for the appetizers we got the chickpea flatbread the arugula salad and the sea scallops  the flatbread and salad were just ok  the sea scallops would have been delicious except for the cured egg yolk which was infused in the avacado sauce  for those who have never tried a cured egg yolk i would consider yourself lucky  actually the taste wasnt too bad  the smell however reminded me of what you would smell if you were on the set of a nasty version of a hoarders tv episode  must be an acquired tastefor the main course we chose the short rib ravioli and the cavatelli  both were excellent especially the ravioli  no complaints at alloverall a very pleasant experience  good atmosphere  our waitress was very friendly  the place was busy and had a nice vibe to it  unfortunately some of the food was a slight disappointment|i was treated to casbah for lunch by a potential employer who had passed me over but really really liked me she said it was her favorite restaurant but that she didnt go as often as shed likei knew the building from the early s when it had been one of pittsburghs dive gay bars called the tender trap and knowing this as well as a lot about the big bistroid groupoopsbig burrito group i was curious to try it out and see if it lived up to the usual big burrito hype  and voila indeed its another excruciatingly overpriced bistroid in da burghthe atmosphere is actually quite lovely inside or out the colors are comfortable the noise levels subtle the seating comfortable and the service staff looks professional young with no coney island side show appearancesthe service was good not overly friendly but not uppity like young people waiting tables in more upscale restaurants tend to be in da bughthe menu was short but did have a list of pretty unique offerings  my friend had a salmon salad and i opted to try the farm lamb macncheese  the waiter brought a small basket with bread to the table accompanied by a single medium sized pat of salted butter to spread  for a beverage we both opted for just wateri have to say if i actually had to pay for this i would have been pretty miffed  for lunch the prices were all around the  range and the portions were not large  the portions were actually fine for lunch not overly filling by any stretch of the imagination but they didnt leave you hungryi cant speak for the salmon as i have never had salmon in any form other than lox that didnt taste like a dried sawdust version of some strong fish she seemed to enjoy it very much so there it isthe farm lamb mac n cheese was tasty the lamb was tender and moist and the mac n cheese was a tiny tube pasta with a very nice creamy cheesy sauce all topped with a bread crumb covering when it was broiled until crispy  it was accompanied by a pinch of mesclun salad topped with another pinch of fried onionsbasically  take one large spoonful of mac n cheese with a higher end cheese sauce and a fancier noodle than comes in the average box  mix in about four cubes of roast lamb sprinkle on a layer of bread crumbs and toss it in the broiler until the crumbs are toasted  then using your index finger and thumb pick up a pinch of mesclun and sit it on the plate next to the mac n cheese bowl  and you have a bistroid expensive art project on a plateseriously  for lunch its mac n cheese peoplei also have to call into question the name and theme  mad mex is bistroid tex mex  soba is bistroid asian  kaya is bistroid caribbeanish  casbah farm lamb mac n cheese sure i can see this as a box lunch while riding a camel through the desertnoti cant say the experience was awful the company was awesome and we had a nice unpressured amount of time for fun chat  the atmosphere was comfortable and the food was tasty  but was it all worthy of a return trip or recommendation  i honestly cant say yes with any kind of cheerleader rave  im not quite sure that i comprehend the mindset of people in this burgh who think paying that kind of money for food is worth it when honestly food with just as much flavor can be found in abundance around town for half the price and twice the portion who are all of these easily dupeable rich people and where do they come from want to blow that kind of money get out your check book and let me give you my address|went here for drinks with some friends  the bar service was definitely interesting  some of the time the waitress was really on point and was there ready to take your drink orders but after the first drink it was really hard to get a second i cant speak for the food but will update my review when i get back to try the food  overall my dirty martini was good though it definitely could have used some better quality olives these were bottled with the red pepper on the inside used on salads  i will definitely be back to try the food but i hope the table service is better than the bar service|for the record i have returned a few times and still entirely stand by my original review from nearly  years ago i will add that the food portions also seem to be decreasing we went during happy hour last week and i had the worst tasting rye drink possible  described as rye with fig jam bitters and lemon sounded like something that cannot possibly be fucked up but tasted like nothing but the juice wrenched out of unripe lemons  super dry and gave me a stomach ache no fig flavor to be detected to make matters worse when my partner tried to ask the bartender about the drink if it was supposed to be sooo godaweful lemony she responded with a yes its got lemon in it when he pressed the issue she simply repeated yes its a lemon and fig drink more frustrating than conversations with the wall the risotto that we ordered was the size one would expect of a side dish which is what risotto should be but this was proposed as an entree it had about  little pieces of maitake mushroom and  hazelnuts in it and was otherwise flavorless we added lots of salt and pepper total waste of  bucks also their bar seating sucks the chairs are stationary and far away from each other and a bit far from the bar for a shorty like me my feet dont reach the foot bar on the chair either so my legs fall asleep trying to sit there|glad to see that the big burrito restaurants are alive and well in pittsburgh and dinner tonight was my first time in awhile at one of their establishmentsbit of a complex review  my biggest gripe with casbah is that its casbah mediterranean when the menu at least on this night but i dont think it changes all that much offers very authentic mediterranean dishes  one lamb dish not overly mediterranean and no couscous or tagine which are major staples of mediterranean cuisine  even a side of hummus and pita or veggies would be nice  nonetheless the menu has lots of fine options just none that ive seen in a typical mediterranean joint  i think its a little misleading especially if youre seeking mediterranean cuisinewe sampled several of the cocktails all of which were creative and well priced  as for food we split the bruschetta prosciutto and blue cheese meatballs pork and the brussel sprouts were quite tasty beet salad and the potato gnocchi so lots of food  all was freshly prepared with quality ingredients and served with sophisticated presentationlots of fine restaurants opening in the area but its clear to see that they have a loyal following|good food great service but high pricesmy date and i shared  appetizers a salad and each had an entree with the recommended wine pairings bill was  without taxpricey by my standards for this experience the new tuna tartare appetizer was the highlight of our night the bruschetta with fig and grape butter prosciutto and blue cheese was good so was the beet saladwe were disappointed with our entrees my roasted duck breast with spinach and gnocchi was not hot my date had the salmon with potato fennel puree which she said tasted fishymake sure you arent seated inside the tent where patrons are eating on a slope on outdoor metal tablesthis is not my idea of a good dinner at this price rangealthough i would come here again there are certainly much better restaurants in the city i would rank casbah below eleven within the big burrito group of restaurants|tonights review it started with a table for two stuffed between two other tables yes there were five other more comfortable two tops available we asked and after some sighs were granted our seemingly offensive request punishment was fastwe sipped our water were provided a refill but no offer to acquire other beverages with plenty of time to review the nights menu we made our selection my request was well done salmon heart issues require well done the chefs feelings were clear as i sawed through the salmon i thought it could possibly be a message i again had offended by my request i like casbah and the other bb restaurants but tonight i should have selected a friendlier more customer focused establishment yes i will return and still recommend casbah oh we did finally get to place a cocktail order  m|i dont understand the high rankings of this place and why it consistently gets into pittsburghs top  the food is rather mediocre for the price i went there twice both times paying close to  for dinner for  but the food really didnt stand up to expectations sea scallops that i have ordered last time were burned outside and rubbery and chewy inside risotto from my previous try was falling apart but the most annoying thing is that there is way way too much food on the plate for fine dining place the appetizer cheese platter that we ordered last time had enough cheese to last for a week i dont go to places like that to stuff myself so no i do not like it overall maybe it is one of those good enough for pittsburgh kind of restaurants but then maybe they should think about charging a bit less unless they charge for quantity not qualityservice is okay|to be honest i feel that this is one of the most overpriced restaurants in the entire city the food is average to good the place is beautiful with outdoor seating but in my opinion the price is just not worth it they have a really good happy hour so i would definitely recommend going to that and maybe trying an appetizer or two|we went here on a double date of sorts  my boyfriend and i and my sister and her fiance  we started with cocktails and a cheese platemy sister ordered the watermelon fizz gin drink and it was super tasty  my boyfriend ordered the berry bourbon i was jealous it was divine i ordered the boyd and basil vodka drink and it was lovely   stars for beverages done rightthe cheese plate was wonderful it came with  different spreads and  different cheese and some prosciutto  athey gave us extra bread and the salted butter and their yogurt butter  it was amazing and we gobbled it all upwe all ordered the arugala salad  it was gorgeous arugula housemade pancetta crimini mushrooms potatoes riverview farms goat cheese pancetta vinaigrette i ordered the roasted gerber farms chicken whole grain mustard gritsgreens fresno peppers fava  preserved lemon pesto thyme jus my sister got the ricotta cavatellihousemade fennel sausage spinachcrushed tomatoes ricotta her fiance ordered the grilled swordfishswiss chard roasted tomato garlic chilies caper crispy polenta espelette meyer lemon vinaigrette my boyfriend got the long island duck roasted breast braised leg gnocchi spinach lavender rhubarb duck jus  my chicken was good not great and a little flavorless the mustard grits were superb the lemon pesto kind of tasted like lemon pledge and really over powered the whole dish which was really disappointingmy sister adores their cavatelli but this time it came out cold she is not one to complain and ate it regardlessher fiances swordfish was perfectly prepared and tasted wonderful my boyfriends duck was cooked to perfection and all the sides were incredible so he says when desert rolled around i was not interested as i was already so full from the dinner my sister ordered a glass off prosecco and chocolate smore caketoasted marshmallow salted caramel ice creamgraham crumb which was deadly i tried a small bite but since i am not a sweets person it was overpoweringly chocolatey her fiance got the vanilla bean crme brulerhubarb chiboust poached rhubarb shortbread cookie which he enjoyed very much the rest of us opted for coffees and watching them eattheir wine selection is dreamy their cocktails are perfection in a glass and their food is absolutely delectablei would go back to casbah at the drop of a hat but i was not completely floored or blown away by any dish|made a reservation on opentable for friday at pm  it wasnt packed at all but the hostess decided to sit us outside without asking where wed prefer to sit it was really hot that day so it was pretty uncomfortable i immediately noticed that a lot of cmu undergrads worked there while i was dining there i saw  cmu classmates i started off with the gazpacho and it was very tasty we were also given some bread with a lavender goat cheese spread the spread was ok for the entrees i got the roasted pepper cavereccia that had crab in it and ricotta cavatelli with sausagefor the cavereccia i thought there was going to be big chunks of crab but i was disappointed to see that the crab was shredded into small pieces the pasta was a little undercooked and the sauce was okthe cavatelli was extremely oily the more you ate it the more you saw the pool of oil it was swimming in i had to wipe some of the oil off the pasta lastly i had the dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding it was pretty good but i wish there were more raspberries in it service was pretty good and the decor outside was nice although it got really stuffy in the outdoor tent this place is pretty expensive and based on the food i wouldnt go back for that price|we had a reservation for saturday night dinner and arrived timely  three times over  minutes the hostess told us they were setting our table  there were  or  empty tables we could see as we waited yet we were not seated no one was seated at those tables  not sure what the deal was with the hostess  also she was extremely rude  however our server was delightful and the food was delicious  too bad the evening started out on the wrong note management needs to give some lessons|while i have always had a great experience with my food i feel the need to update my prior review based on my experience at brunch today  when my food came out there was a very visible hair on my plate i was with a large group and did not want to make a scene so i mentioned it to the server who immediately took my plate away the manager on duty came out to apologize which i did appreciate however i was a little surprised because when they brought my plate out about  minutes later i could tell that it was the same exact plate first off it was not even warm so if they made my meal on the spot you would think it would be hot or at the very least warm i had also substituted bacon for the sausage that normally comes with the entree and if the chef had made a new plate on the spot he would probably have sent it out with the sausage or with a side of bacon again which he did not they had served my bacon on the side when they brought it out initially     everything was in the exact same place on the plate i wasnt going to cause a scene so i pretended to enjoy it but did not i was quite repulsedin my last review i had said that casbah was my favorite restaurant in pittsburgh i had mentioned that the cassericia dish was my favorite but that they had removed it from the menu the last time i tried to order it there for dinner i received a response from someone at the restaurant that she was not sure why i would think that because it is still offered and i explained that the waiter told me it was removed from the menu im not really sure what happened here but i can tell you this i dont think that casbah is my favorite anymore in fact not only is it not my favorite it has taken a plunge to the bottom of my list of places to eat for me if you expect to eat at a top restaurant the service should be top of the line and it has just been too inconsistent for my taste no thanks casbah|stopped here for drinks before we went on to dinner elsewhere in hindsight we wish we had stayed here we had a couple of great beers and just enjoyed the excellent music soundtrack before we moved on to our next designation i hope to come back here sometime in the future and actually havea meal i like this funkier part of town|i enjoyed my previous experiences at casbah but this past weekend was a disappointment despite having a reservation well in advance my husband and i were seated at a horrible table right next to the hallway that leads to the kitchen and bathrooms there was a constant stream of distractions service was also really slow and my sea bass was bland i expected better from casbah|i had my first experience with casbah on a recent friday night in a group of  without a reservation arriving around pm here is a summary of our experience pros  ambiance is nice upscale not too loud  we were able to find a low table in the bar within  minutes  drinks were good generously proportioned cocktails were priced as expected for the type of place  wine list had multiple options by the glass as for the meal the meats were good cuts well prepared cons  overall the food felt rich with creams fats salt without any particular inspiration showing through the ingredients were all good and well sourced but the finished products did not seem to elevate them in any particular way  the service was high end of amateur  not what i was expecting from this caliber of restaurant our  minute wait stretched to hr min without any meaningful acknowledgement by the staff upon sitting we were told that they usually have excellent sourdough bread but they were out of it for tonight so we had ciabatta which was fine but we didnt need to hear what we didnt get to have food vegetarian options reviewed directly meat options as reported by dining companions cheese plate nicely prepared with a good range of cheeses only complaint was that the cheeses were served too cold to fully appreciate them  beet salad the greens were good the dressing was a bit too mild to offset the beets the beets themselves were gritty and not particularly well cooked  squash soup overall very good  quite rich but flavorful felt like the salt and cream were taking over the squash  mushroom pasta again quite rich and salty packed with high quality mushrooms but didnt feel that they were quite given justice due to the salt and butter pasta was high quality but again overshadowed by the salt and butter  steak good cut of meat cooked well ragu pasta excellent pasta dish well cooked reported to be almost as good as piccolo fornos overall a similar experience at  the price would have received  stars for the price of the meal this was barely a  star event we wont be going back even with the lure of  for  entrees around our birthdays  the food just isnt that good even discounting the service im sure they will continue to do well with a certain crowd but there are much better dinner options out there|mixed results  made a reservation and we were seated in a dark corner at a tiny table is the money from having that table worth the negative experience guests will receive methinks not  i had to ask to be moved to the patio which was much betterthe drinks we ordered from the bar were watery the manhattan and some drink with applejack in it later they made a mistake and sent us the wrong cocktail which turned out to be much better than the ones we wanted appetizers meatballs with brussels sprouts and beet salad were very good but the main courses left a lot to be desired in terms of seasoning  the texture of the short rib in the ravioli wasnt quite right sort of dry maybe overcooked  we had a bread pudding for dessert which was probably the best part of the meal i expect a better overall experience for the money|have i mention i love the big burrito group all i did was confirm that i still wanted to be subscribed to their email list and they sent me a free lunch entree for responding i decided to use this coupon to try one of their restaurants that i havent yetyum i decided to go with the piccola gusta option so that i could try a bit of everything i went with the arugula salad gnocchi and sword fish sandwich it was all outstandingunfortunately there was a large dark hair in my salad that i noticed immediately thank goodness and our waiter took care of it promptly a lot of times i would let that ruin my experience but i tried very hard to not let it anyway finished the meal with the carrot gob again yumour service after that was just okay he seemed to kind of forget about us it was a bit odd at one point we had no forks for a while with entrees in front of us i guess i always expect something a little more as far as service when something like a hair accident happensthe food makes this place hands down as long as there isnt hair in it we sat in the covered indoor porch area which was cute for lunch but honestly seemed as though they segregated people by their appearance in who sat inside when going in to use the restroom once they work on their service casbah could easily be  stars maybe next time|its hard to judge and review based on takeout alone especially at a place with such an atmosphere like casbah but here its goesmy boss decided to treat us all for lunch so i looked for something that appealed to me i must admit that the menu scared me at first its definitely more of an upscale kind of place but not quite a suit  tie affair i settled on the bacon and turkey club seemed safe i didnt think it was anything amazing yes i said it ive been looking forward to eating here too the sandwich was just sort of plain the sauces were bland and did nothing for me it all just seemed very dry aside from the tasty bread and bacon i wasnt too impressed for a cheaper price i could have ordered a club sandwich from a mom and pops greasy spoon and been more satisfied i also ordered a salad which consisted of lettuce and beets dressing was okay but a little tangy all in all id like to return and actually enjoy a meal in the restaurant atmosphere does a lot for a place so a trip back is definitely in order also id like to actually study the menu and ask some questions to make sure i can order something good at work i was a little rushed to make a decisionside note  the takeout packaging is awesome high quality microwaveablereusable plasticware|i want to start by saying that it kills me to give casbah two stars and i wish there were two rating systems  one for the food and another one for service since my review is really about the latter the food as always is exceptionali have been going to casbah for well over a decade and it is a place where my family has always celebrated special occasions because of the wonderful atmosphere food and the great service  or what used to be great service we went to casbah last night for dinner to celebrate a family birthday expecting to have a nice memorable evening alas that wasnt to be our server seth and the service provided by him can be described in just one word  indifference he went through the motions of taking our order and bringing us our food but that was it we were never told of any specials we were not brought any bread till we asked for it we were not asked for refills on our drinks or even our water we were not once asked how the food was and if we needed anything else on ordering dessert we were not asked if we needed coffee or drinks to go with and so on in my book indifference is worse than bad service  i could have looked past it if it was just the servers style and lack of work ethic every place has some of those people but what really highlighted this lackluster service was that the very same server was providing exceptional service to a neighboring table with a much larger party than ours perhaps because gratuity was automatically included i dont know but suffice to say i was very disappointed and somewhat annoyed casbah is not your neighborhood place to drop in for dinner and the food and ambiance dont come cheap so the least they can do is to make sure that service is consistent it is relatively easy to attract new customers but really tough to sustain them  i hope this was just a onetime occurrence but i feel like i need to highlight it in a public forum in the hope that someone from big burrito sees this and has it addressed im so disappointed i hope i can go back there again i would hate to lose this place|although weve only had brunch here im not totally sure that well be back for dinner service  casbah is a whopping  miles from home thats at least a thousand feet so while its convenience and accepting of reservations reign high on my list of musthaves the food left me slightly disappointed  considering the price point here weve dropped a star level or soi made reservations for brunch definitely do this the place was full when we arrived at noon and strolled through the patio area to the actual restaurant  that set up is strange itself especially with no indication of where im headed  we were quickly seated in close quarters with our other lovely brunch eating brethren  service was fine  were easy guests and our waiter was more than tolerant with the  having not scoured the menu to make sure he would like something there like i had  we both opted to go with the prix fixe with most items hitting the halfway point  bucks seemed great for including an appetizer and cocktailmy bellini was done right  fancy style making all the schnapps ha sorry  the appetizer of granola with a lil yogurt that seemed more like cream cheese fatty goodness than the very vanilla yoplait lite i typically let myself have a sprinkling of berries hit the spot  sweet enough for memapley and richand didnt even for a second seem like someone poured some nature valley in a bowl  the  ordered the cinnamon killed polenta and couldnt get enough so i barely got anyour entrees though are a different story   got the mushroom and goat omelet with his little roasted potatoes and his little sausage and his little toast and was all happy enough with it i am not so easy i guess  the brioche french toast sounded great  caramelized pear sold  i received next to a large meaty chicken sausage link a few small pieces of fruit and one slice of french toast  how is that a thing  maybe this is the husky child in me but i was not expecting one slice  luckily with the prix fixe there was no way i would have been able to eat more than one but really  if i had only ordered that at some doubledigit menu price i would not be a happy camperoverall really it was fine  the food was actually better than i make it sound it just didnt hit the expectations everyone had set for me  the hungry girl me will always require more than one slice of sugar bread  curiosity of dinner with reservations might bring me back if i dont want to make the trek elsewhere with february arctic conditions again maybe|parking street parking or valet initial thoughts ive heard this place had great food and since i was quite hungry i was excited wait time we had a reservation so we were seated right away service great  the waiters were attentive and made sure we were enjoying our meal and had our water glasses filled appetizerssmall dishes cheese tasting with  cheese  it was so tiny not worth the price the cheese were interesting but for the cost i expected more than just a few small slices of bread a few slices of cheese and a dollop of jam main dish long island duck  too salty i thought the duck itself was cooked well but as i was eating it i had to constantly drink water to make up for the taste there were a few measly pieces of gnocchi there was no lavender flavor or kumquats i would recommend getting something other than this dish if you do go drinks we ordered a bottle of riesling which was good but nothing special cost the main dishes were all around  for the cost i expected the flavor to wow me but really i just need a lot of water to drink ambience we sat in the part of the restaurant that was under a tentlike structure it was a bit chilly but they had the heated lights on it is dark so dont expect to take any good photos overall just okay i wish i could give it more stars but really it was disappointing after that unsettling duck main dish im not sure if im willing to try this place again|we were excited to go to casbah after hearing good things from locals and having gone to mad mex which was truly great texmex food despite trying to be optimistic we really left unimpressed heres the breakdowncocktailsdrinks the list was unimaginative and wifes cocktail was neither refreshing not very strong the beers offered were not great one was flat gnuti this was somewhat tasty and rich with well cooked chunks of lobster however nothing ill remember tomorrow octopus the list of ingredients and fact that it is a mediterranean restaurant makes you think this would be light and fresh w a salty kick from the prosciutto but it seemed to be cooked with the prosciutto andor brown sugar and was overcooked a heavy lumbering dish that not even fennel could make up for this was a big disappointment halibut  the fish was well cooked but the dish was generic not exciting nor offensive forgettable casericcha sp this really was the standout the scallops were cooked well and it was chock full of crab it was very rich nothing about the preparation was special and it wasnt spicy and it was green with pesto so the name red pepper is somewhat of a misnomer but for the pure weight of fresh lump crab makes this dish  even with a pretty high price for pasta of dessert milk sponge cake small and fairly dry which again with name sponge one would be disappointed to expect a moist cake service the service was fine not amazing seemed like waiter was a little too busy for the higher prices of food although the ambience on porch was nice they seemed to have a hard time regulating the temperature with various times of sweat building on the brow throughout the meal total something and given the price how good everything looked on the menu and the disappointment of anticipated greatness im rounding down big burrito is a shooting  props to mad mex curious to see how they do in the rubber match|we went to casbah this past saturday   it is my birthday month and big burrito offers a great deal for anyone who is on their mailing list providing their patrons with a free entre up to  at any of their locations beside umi  i chose casbah since i have been to all of them but this oneour reservations were early at pm on a sunday  we arrived seated quickly in their outside seating area which is very nice  we were brought some water while we reviewed the menu  i decided to start with a manhattan to drink  it was very nice and strong  next we decided to order  earlier i looked online at their menu and i decided i would be ordering either the cioppino littleneck clams mussels shrimp scallops halibut grilled sourdough  or their long island duck roasted breast braised leg gnocchi spinach lavender peaches duck jus   i have had the duck dish at soba before and loved it but i wanted to try the cioppino despite that since i also love seafood and shellfish  this i would discover was a mistake  my partner got the pork chop dinner  we placed our orders and waitedduring our wait they brought some bread  it was a nice touch the bread was warm and served with two types of spreads  by the time our entres came i wanted another drink and asked for boyd and basil   boyd  blair vodka fresh lemon basil soda angostura bitters this was one of their signature cocktails  so we began to eat  the scallops in the dish were excellent  perfect sear and seasoned as well as the shrimp  the tiny piece of halibut in the dish and i mean tiny was so overcooked  i choked it down but completely unappealing and tiny  the sauce in this fish soup was also not that great  the dish came with bread to soak up the juices but the bread itself was burnt and hard  it actually hurt my mouth to bite it and that was after dipping it in the juices  i was going to ask for more bread hold the burn but our server had not come back  so i finished the meal and said forget it  at this point the drink i ordered was still not delivered  i was done eating and had to use the restroom so i told my husband if he came back without my drink to tell him forget it and just bring the check  when i got back to the table that was indeed what happened  except he told him he was sorry and if we ordered dessert he would comp my drink  so when he finally returned he ordered the chocolate cheese cake bombe pinotage syrup  whipped cream hazelnuts praline ice cream gastrique when the waiter asked me i simply said no thank you can i just have the drink i ordered  he brought dessert and my drink and explained it was on the house and it was theirhis fault  no biggy really i was way more annoyed with my meal  i think what really bothered me was one how small the entre was  it was more suited to be a lunch portion in my opinion  and then how much it was but i did have the coupon so i guess i cant complain that much about that  simply put if i had spent  on the meal i got i would have been very upset  lastly the halibut was so overcooked and dry same with the toast and the sauce wasnt that pleasant  all in all i wish i would have gone with the duck  live and learn|its good when they are on but they are so inconsistent you never know what you are going to get  the coffee machine looks like it hasnt been cleaned in the last century which is off putting  generally i wouldnt recommend it unless you are in the neighborhood and desperately hungryyou might catch a lucky break and be there on a good day|food is tasty though portions are for the waifish hipster types location is inconvenient and i would not recommend people walking by themselves at night on that stretch of penn service is very uneven ie bad even when the place is practically dead i cant really speak on the coffee though they do have good tissaneshowever getting them to refill your hot water is another thingokay i wont change my rating but i take back what i said about the food they have changed the menu and it is really bad we had buffalo tofu sticks which were ridiculously dry i had the thai peanut tofu wrap which tasted just like peanut butter i dont understand the point of mockamole its made with peas instead of avocado how to describe the food its as if they took pictures of how food should look and made the food without thinking about how food should taste gee peas are green just like avocados i would go there for coffeetea or whatever to hang out but not for the food okay there was one decent thing on the menu which was the artichoke dip i was completely disappointed|quiet storm is perhaps the most expensive vegetarian diner i have ever been to even by big city standards cashonly makes this even more difficult tofu wings appetizer was simply not very good and i usually love these things i tried the gyro wrap which was also a big disappointment as far as i know gyros are supposed to be pretty meaty but this was mostly lettuce with sporadic chunks of seitan and cucumberalong  with dreaded diced unripe tomato the wrap was dry and upon looking at the menu again i see that the sauce that it probably requires costs an extra  the tortilla itself was very white and seemingly unnatural compared to those found at most veggie establishments my beverage was good and affordableginger lemonade it was sweet for my tastes but i am sure most people would have thought it perfect ill keep quiet storm in mind as a coffee shop onlyfyi after splitting the cost of the appetizer with a friend my lunch cost me ouch i did have half of the wrap leftover and ate it later as a salad with my own dressing it was quite good that way and i might recommend that qs rethink the gyro presentation if they want to continue using so much lettuce|pretty good veggie food  ive had breakfast lunch and dinner here  french toast tofu scramble museli salads sandwiches lasagna  they have a pretty decent variety|i was super excited to try quiet storm when i moved to pittsburgh because all of the reviews i read were fantastic  however i have visited multiple times now continuously hoping for improvement and each time ive been disappointed  lets start with the good things  qs has a great atmosphere it definitely helped the transition from austin  very chill hippie vibe  however the servers although friendly can  sometimes be a touch hippieelitest  the food was alright  their homefries were quite tasty but little else has tantalized my taste buds and i have tried many things  i do love their thai dressing very yummy on the salads  will i continue to go back  probably wishful thinking is  a good thing|every time i visit qs i hope for a better experience but continue to receive poor service and ok food i always get the feeling that the wait staff does not want you to be there it is never friendly it seems cold food is ok but often taste old and like it has been reheated multiple timesugh i really wish they would put a lil more effort into customer service|im going to revise my review of quiet stormyou may get lucky and find yourself faced with an awesome rendering of a fabulouslydesigned vegetarian sandwich in my experience however considering the  cubanos ive eaten there youre more likely to get a sad mediocre renditionconsistency is not their strong pointadd to that the likelihood that you may be dosed with some surly owner attitude and ive decided to steer clearits a shame that i no longer feel its worth it to chase the beautiful dream of my first meals at quiet storm its also a shame that many of their staff are wonderful friendly and helpful and yet their efforts are overshadowedsorry quiet storm as a pittsburgh vegetarian i want to love you but you broke my heart|this place is so hitormiss for me sometimes the food is amazing sometimes it is terrible example i ordered the spicy peanut wrap for the first time and fell in love with it i came back a couple weeks later and it was bland and unappetizing maybe there is someone who works in the kitchen who doesnt know where the spice rack is i dont knowthe waitstaff is hitormiss too sometimes theyre great other times ive waited for ages just for a menu one guy actually snapped at me for asking for a breakfast item at lunch that said there are some good dishes like the black  gold i like that in some dishes you can replace rice with salad a lot of people ive eaten with here have raved about the quesadillas theres a nice laid back atmosphere and fun retro diner decor theres also an extensive but expensive drinks menu with milkshakes teas and coffee drinks and a nice selection of locallymade vegan sweets and pastries and i love the magazine and book rack even though the magazines are usually two years old still fun to read|remember the days of bands in the back at night and interesting kids hanging out at the bar all day well the bands were the first to go followed quickly by the comfy sofas the kids didnt take long to leave and now years later faced with a frankly lessthanappetizing saturday menu i find that the ability to substitute something else for the increasing amounts of potato filler is gone tooquiet storm used to be a straight five star my last experience was honestly twostar but nostalgia and history dont allow me to give it less than a threeim sure all the changes over the years have been in the name of efficiency but theyve come at expense to the clientele heres hoping quiet storm rediscovers the mojo and the menu that once made them great|the menu looks awesome and the dish concepts are good except everything that comes out is disappointingly bland thank god there were bottles of hot sauce and salt on the table the best part of the meal was the peanut butter chocolate milk shake the burger and spicy cajun soup were very mediocre|a nice cheap place to get your vegetarianvegan eat on  brunch is always nice and the specialty coffee drinks are fun to look through if only for the names meanwhile youll be eating off melamine and drinking from odd glasses but the food is great for the price and someone has to employ all the hipsters on penn ave|im  and have been a vegetarian for  yearsfor vegetarian food in pittsburgh i say this place is aces but compared to the many other veggie restaurants ive been to in this past this place is average its really hit and miss with their dishes when at a veggie place i usually try to change it up each time i go to keep my diet varied this has proven to be a little difficult at quiet storm because it seems every other time i get something i dont like apple panini is amazing nachos are great curry wasnt spicy enough grits runny milkshakes yum i feel like the cooks dont have a good handle on cooking tofu there different dishes require tofu to be cooked for different lengths of time and it different sauces and it has always tasted bizarre when i get it there sometimes its not pressed and cooked long enough sometimes its dried out how can tofu get dried out this is coming from someone who loves tofu i can eat silken tofu straight out of the package with a little soy sauce and sugarif you have spent anytime in portland oregon the atmosphere in this place is very portland outdoorsy hipster cafe style its loud but i couldnt imagine it another way they also have pinball which is awesome we havent taken advantage of this but they do have board games and books available as well|we stopped by quiet storm for a late lunch while on vacation in pittsburgh  the food was excellent  i had the cheese steak and my husband had a peanut tofu wrap both were served with chips  everything was great  if i had any complaint it would be that i didnt see on the menu that my cheese steak had mayo on it  im not a big fan of it so had i see that i would have asked for it without  other then that great place|ive been back to quiet storm many times i can accept the hit or miss service since its pretty cheap and casual thats not really an excuse for bad service it only somehow softens the blow but why be mediocre the environment is comfortable unless you sense the servers dont want you there the music ranges and is appropriate for the environment its never too loud or aggressive free wifi helps and the milkshakes are slammin the food is inconsistent but often good the blackadilla is my favorite i really want to like quiet storm but it only merits  stars their food service and hours are inconsistent it seems they often close early owners please stick to your business hours its not like youre open that late to begin with perhaps everybody wants to go home i dont blame them for that and you may have run out of a few things but try to imagine the disappointment of trekking out there to enjoy your favorite shake or snack and then being turned away  or if you believe this is an acceptable business practice it would be less infuriating if you simply changed your hours to am  until we feel like it  this way there are no set expectations and we cant really begrudge you for it my vote is to just stick with the hours you createdthanks|i really really wanted to like this restaurant hip quirky vegetarianvegan lots of owls and kitschy deco i eat meat occasionally but had a vegetarian buddy here to visit and thought this would be a great choice whats not to love right well for starters the service our server was really nice and had lots of reviews suggestions and alternate ideas for what we should order but the service was mindnumbingly ridiculously slow and the place was half empty plus even after two requests for napkins which were not provided to begin with and not available from other empty tables around us we never received any napkins at all im not really a messy eater but come onmaybe part of the problem was expectations we kicked things off with the firesticks appetizer some really tasty quesadillaish things after that our orders i had the thai salad were just kind of boring strangely spiced i feel like the bar was set high with the app and then none of the entrees met the expectations of yummy veggie goodness and my dining companions agreed i also ordered a cup of the mac  cheese and it was awful you know how when you reheat elbow mac  cheese in the microwave and the cheese gets all greasygloopy and the noodles stick together well it was exactly that with some powdered garlic sprinked on top really i should have made my own leftover mac at home and not paid  for a cup of that learn from my mistakewe had planned to order milkshakes too but our server spent so much time in a black hole or something that by the time she finally returned wed been completely finished with our meal for at least  minutes for  and probably a ridiculous wait per milkshake we decided to hit the milkshake factory on east carson instead|my experience has been ok at the quiet storm because i have  not deviated much from my usual menu choice original home fries  delicious and  i have often known several members of the wait staff at any given timethis has given me reason to continue eating at quiet storm on occasionnegatives i have eaten with several others over the years who have been wholly dissatisfied with their meals small portions not enough seasonings could taste baking soda flavor in baked goods etc service can be a little slow at times and i have been burned a few times when going out of my way it is a little off the beaten path for many to score some delicious home fries only to find that the qs had inexplicably closed earlydespite this for pittsburgh the qs is a good spot for veganvegetarian fare|so when we first went here for brunch i had no idea it was a vegetarian restaurant  thats an unpleasant prospect to face down after a hard night of drinking which is the only time the idea of brunch ever occurs to me  but then the grim spectre of laziness appeared to me and asked do you really want to drive to another place  just look at you your wearing the same shirt that you wore yesterday dude  the spectre of laziness is a dick but he was also right  and to my surprise nothing i had was bad at all  for brunch options meat eaters will find that potatoes and eggs are the cornerstone of any breakfast and seitan substitutions are not as bad as say having the grim spectre of laziness point out your slovenly appearance  i think the biggest surprise in this place is that though nothing is particularly jarring to the palate there is nothing that really stands out as being amazing  in yelp terms its kind of a   for hard core vegetarians having a night er midafternoon on the town its probably a blessed change from the meat based culture that pittsburgh is pretty famous for  but im willing to wager that very meat eaters will become converted to vegetarians after this  maybe they did too good of a job substituting meat items  that being said we did make it back another time for lunch where i had a vegetarian gyro  my friend said it best whats the fucking pointthe service is always very sweet but both times the waiters have been curiously nay ominously spacey  even when it wasnt crowded there had to be some substantial flag downs and polite and doleful eye contact before they would do what you needed  if youre in the area and looking forthis type of thing you really dont have too many other options so just eat it|daniel fast friendly restaurant with good food stopped for an early supper before saturday night church service after searching yelp for vegan restaurant options food was good service was good price was very reasonable think i just found a new saturday evening supper spot|why do vegetarian restaurants think we need fake meat this i do not understand  i had a primavera sandwich which was just ok but the patty on the roll was just as perplexing as the mystery meat you get in your elementary school cafeteria my sandwich came with a boring pasta salad and some tortilla chips out of a bag  otherwise the atmosphere was fun and the wifi was free if you ask for the password|despite my star rating i think i will be coming back here again to give it a second tryi got the smashed potatoes with seitan cheese and aioli  the first bite was okthe aioli didnt quite suit my taste but everything else worked pretty well together  however  someodd bites in to the dish the flavors were getting repetitive and the mushy texture started to gross me out  i got about halfway through eating the dish and the soso aioli became too much for me  i couldnt take another bitehowever my wifes apple panini was delicious  i would probably eat a few of those if i came back  the cream cheese cinnamon from the bread and apple all worked together in glorious harmonyon a strange note while we were eating some camera guys came in and started setting up what looked to be an interview  we asked the staff what was going on  apparently someone was filming their submissionapplication to be on a reality show  oh cool we thought  what reality show we asked  not sure something on the golf channel they replied  hahahaha  i thought watching grass growing on tv was boring enough  now theyre making a reality show about itin the end  the gross aioli was inexcusable to me  otherwise id probably go  stars   i still plan to come back and give it another shot|i really wanted to write a positive review for the quiet storm my boyfriend and i have been going here for years and always had a great experience  tasty food were both not huge meat eaters but not vegetarians either great service one waitress recognizes us and always goes out of her way to say hi and nice atmosphere definitely not a hipster myself but never felt uncomfortable or like i was sticking out unfortunately the recent menu and more importantly price changes have made this go from a regular weekend brunch place to only a specialoccasion place the menu went from  pages to just  still good food though  try the grits and the prices went up to ish before tax its not completely unreasonable but just enough for this to stop being a regular place for us i still enjoy the food and atmosphere but dont really think its worth the money|yes i know  im probably one of the few people that has rated this place with two starsbut let me explain  my friends and i wanted to try this place out and had high hopes  i havent heard of many vegetarianvegan places in pittsburgh so i expected to have some awesome vegetarian food  however from the get go our host was absolutely terrible  he did not look us in the eye and was just overall awkward  there was obviously room in the restaurant for the four of us but he had to look in the back to see if there was room  one of the other servers eventually sat us in a clearly empty table that we could have picked out for ourselves  our first host came back reiterated the same thing the server told us but never gave us menus  i had to go out of my way to ask for menus about five or ten minutes after we had been seatedto be fair our assigned server was very nice  she was friendly and approachable  but of course our food came and mine was cold  the potatoes in the hash i ordered was stale old and cold and had such a small accompanying serving of bread  also our utensils werent given to us until after our food was served  i know i may be sounding like a little bit of a snob but utensils should be expected before the food arrives  not to be completely biased the rest my party had decent food  it just wasnt anything special  definitely not worth  for brunchneedless to say i will not be coming back to this place|i came into quiet storm not intending to have lunch but just a latte and hang out to answer some emails for a little while working from home makes me stir crazy so bouncing around local coffeehouses completely not fitting in with the crowd kinda makes my day sometimes i walked up to the bar and was just going to grab a seat there but super hipster server guy asked me to take a table because it had an outlet to plug my laptop in i didnt need to but   good lookin out anyway ordered my latte  good espresso but pretty weak foam served in a pint glass thats fine menu actually looked really good so i went for a sammy with apples seitan sausage crumbles and cheese they offer different sides but my super hipster server guy didnt ask me what i wanted so being a newbie i figured maybe that was only with certain menu items i was wrong when the guy taking care of the table behind me was asked what he wanted my fault for not speaking up sandwich was good not to die for though and frankly kinda small for  ill finish with this internets are free right so wheres the code did i need to askill definitely go back though intrigued by a few other things on the menu like bbq tenders and pulled pork quesadilla and hopefully be a little more impressed|so i admit my boyfriend and i actually didnt know it was vegetarianvegan until we had ordered our food and looked more closely we went this past weekend and had brunch we each had thai coffee which was ok not stupendous not horrible he ordered the veggie burger and i had the chocolate oatmeal pancakeshis burger was unseasoned and fairly cold my pancakes were okaybut to be honest really lacked flavor the taste of what i imagine cardboard to be came to mind i dont discriminate im all for veggies and vegan food but just because those are your ingredients doesnt mean you cant cook things well and add seasoningi am intrigued to go back because the apple cheese panini sounded possibly better than what we had  i will note that ourwaitress was very sweet and friendly but the food was just lacking in flavor so much that its really deterred us from going back|ive found the service here to be pretty terrible servers can be pretty careless about taking care of simple things and my friends have had similar experiences the food is really pretty good but if the overall service sucks then well it makes it hard to enjoy a tasty meal sorry storm you need to improve this|food was great vegetarian burrito stuffed with mac and cheese yes please  also had a great pot of tea and a bangin white chocolate hazelnut banana milkshake  its a really cute place toohowever the owner was seriously rude to me and my fellow guests when we asked to split a check which they state on the menu is allowed  not even passive aggressive straight up aggressive for something that was not our fault  so that was a sour end to my experience at quiet storm but my belly was satisfied|andrew here said it best   food served by workers who mostly dont seem to notice theyre working and when they do only respond snarkilyit took me  minutes to get a sandwich here and when i complained i didnt get an apology just a snarky remark well you can see we have a small kitchen|im still not convinced that this is a vegetarian restaurant it just has to be a parody of a vegetarian restaurant like every time i start reading the menu i think ashton kutcher is going to pop out and tell me ive been punkda small disclaimer i am not vegan or vegetarian and i never will be i love meat but i also love vegetables and fruits and pretty much the entire food pyramid and these things can be combined to make tasty vegan food but texturized vegetable protein hydrated with seasonings is not food to me yep that description of their chorizo comes directly off their menu eating vegetarian does not mean you need to subject yourself to these highly processed foodsless processed substitutes like tofu tempeh and seitan are used as well but they are mostly treated as a standin for meat i guess if you are a vegetarian that misses eating meat this may satisfy you however as an omnivore why would i eat a fauxblt when i can eat a real one how about instead of trying to imitate the flavor and texture of meat we actually come up with creative combinations of vegetables fruits and legumes that are delicious in their own right what a concept have you ever eaten a vegetarian dish and thought whoa i cant believe i actually like this better than meat i have but dont expect that feeling here it will be more like ummi guess tofu mixed with nutritional yeast is kinda reminiscent of scrambled eggstwo stars because i really like the drinks here the ones i remember trying were the ginger lemonade the mexican hot chocolate and the root beer with a shot of espresso they have some really wonderful sounding tea options that i wish i could try but i generally avoid this place because of the food|i dont think i would have known about quiet storm if it hadnt popped up several times in friends yelp feeds in the last couple years  im all about vegvegan restaurants but i have to agree with other reviewers who wish quiet storms food was slightly more interesting  husband and i ordered takeout so we could enjoy a late lunch al fresco at schenley park overlook  folks working were veganhipster quirky but friendly and helpful  we ended up waiting about  minutes for our food so we decided to partake in an afternoon coffee to pass the time  i  had an iced morroccan latt with cardamom and rose  husband the mandorla sweet almond milk latt  both were excellentfor my meal i picked the tahini bowl with brown rice spinach roasted red pepper tomatoes pepitas and fried tofu cutlet with a tahini dressing  i wished there had been less rice and more dressing the bowl was also screaming for more seasoning  husband opted for the crunch wrap extreme scrambled tofu tossed with celery carrots edamame kale and spinach dressed with vegan wasabi mayo  again twice as much dressing would have added flavor and moisture to an otherwise fine wrapand thats just it the food at quiet storm is fine  when really id been hoping to be utterly wowed by the magic capable of being worked by nothing more than mere vegetables plain grains and humble legumes  still i wont discourage you from eating here  i just might come back myself|this place is a train wreck quiet no storm yes loud slow bland food and annoying service are only a few of the complaints that i have  the vegan  hipster  metal thing has got to go all i kept on seeing through the kitchen window was the armpit hair of the cook wearing the motrhead tank top i am a huge motrhead fan but when i go to an overpriced restaurant i dont want lemmy to be making my food  the food is bland shoving a bunch of brown rice and black beans in a tortilla does not automatically make the food vegan and there were very few things on the menu that were  vegan  the service was pretty bad our appetizer came to the table with our main dish and the entire time we watched the staff eat their dinner in front of everyone at the counter i am pretty sure that three different cooks made our order as the cooks were tag teaming the line while they were eating  last but not least the volume level in the place was numbing the guy working the counter kept on slamming the ice cream freezer door every time he made a milkshake the music was some sort of bjork style electronica that i am pretty sure was written to induce migraines and there were about  hippy couples letting their kids run wild i have been to plenty of vegetarian restaurants in my travels and quiet storm does not even come close to the top  i think pittsburgh deserves better|its not what i expectedwe waited near the sign wait here to be seated for about  mn while the waitresses were hanging out before my husband grabbed someone who told him that we should wait over  mn finally we sat down the service was cold the waitress seemed unsure of almost everything we asked about i took the nyam the pudding was yammy but the black beans were hard my husbands frittata was bof just ok nothing special wont go back there|in all fairness i went to this place after stuffing myself at vincents pizza park  still i know a good pizza when i see one and this place is totally passable but great or even good it is not  my friend and i were given our pizza in a box although we were planning on eating on the premises  still it seemed like we were not wanted and decided not to press the point  we walked across the street to a parking lot and saw a pizza perfecttta box and some leftover pizza littered on the ground  in the end we didnt finish our pizza and assumed that many people in the past have been hastily handed their pizza pushed out the door only to walk across the street eat mediocre pizza and decide it wasnt even worth the energy to pick it up and throw it away|ew okay not the worst pizza ever but its pretty far down my list of pizzeriasand thats sad considering i quite literally live across the street from it this should be my goto pizza destination but id rather pay a delivery charge than eat their pizza the sauce is way too sweet like papa johns sweet and there isnt enough cheese there are too many decent pizza delivery places around to settle for this the only thing i enjoy about pizza perfectta is that their sign hilariously claims excitingly flavored personally i wasnt having an orgasm over my mediocre pizza maybe if they wouldnt have tempted me with such language i would be less pissed off at them two stars only because they let me borrow some paper cups when i moved into my apartment and hadnt unpacked my kitchen stuff yet without them i may have had to travel half a block north and grab some from a different restaurant thanks pizza perfecttaoh and heres a little italian lesson for you its perfetta not perfectta|ordered delivery here with coworkers the other eveningi ordered an appetizer or what i thought was an appetizer  the portion size was amazing that i had some to take home with me to snack on  i only ordered the bread sticks but they were amazing  hand made baked and topped with oil and parmesan cheese  comes with a side of marinara sauce for dipping and i was very pleasedthe reason for the three stars was the time it took for delivery  i believe from the timed the order was called in it took over a hour to have the food show up  not so good|i called for a delivery of a pepperoni pizza large very simple since i was in the mood for it the delivery and the time taken were exceptional very fast very good delivery service the down side is the pizza it was hot and fresh but the flavor was just ok it wasnt the best nor was it the worst it was just okif you do find that you like your pizza and need a quick delivery you cant go wrong here other than that you may want to look elsewhere|do not order the hot wings if you enjoy eating hot sauce flavored gravy paste then by all means these are the wings for you if not stay away my boyfriend and i each ate one and couldnt even finish the rest of our dinner dont waste your money|got the rancho and the greek not so bad but i probably wont go back too heavy for me|calzone was good ricotta was xlnt also had buffalo fries arrived soggy  perhaps they should bakeappeared to be deepfried delivery was right at what they told me when i ordered theyre always good with service ive had various pizzas as well id order from here again not exceptional but always tasty ontime and good service id give  if i could|i was a bit disappointed with the pizza i got i ordered the milano special pizza which had pepperoni bacon sausage bell peppers mushrooms olives tomatoes etc and the popcorn chicken the order itself arrived within thirty minutes which was great although the pizza tasted decent the crust was not crispy at all the slices were pretty floppy they also skimped on the toppings a bit i was hoping for a more loaded pizza im not watching my weighti can handle it as far as the popcorn chicken goes it was too salty even with the honey dijon dipping sauce probably not ordering from here again|working weekend shifts at work are kind of annoying but the perks can be sweet one being free lunch this previous weekend my boss bought us lunch from pizza perfecta after ordering pizza at home twice that week we did not feel like cooking i decided to go with a grilled chicken salad meh im not saying it was bad but it wasnt really that great either i thought they could have dressed it up some more it was loaded with too much cheese and it melted due to the fries being warm making the top of the salad kind of gross underneath the melted cheese was the lettuce tomatoes onions and cucumber i guess this is all standard for a salad but it really just didnt impress me plus i thought the chicken tasted precooked which should be a big nono for restaurants one perk however was the size as it was pretty big however for  i felt it was a little steep i also had a slice of pizza i cant resist pizza and it was comparable to any other pizza shop service is very good though i placed the order and the employee i spoke with was very friendly they had it delivered in time as well im not complaining because it was a free lunch but i would never order myself|ive been to about  pizza places in pittsburgh and this is one i would not go back to pizza is pretty bland and there is nothing remarkable about it|on the positive side the delivery was pretty quick given i ordered during the dinner rush where i would consider under an hour to be pretty exceptional after that the food was pretty meh the pizza wasnt bad but it wasnt great either given the relative quick delivery it was on the cold side upon arrival also i had ordered a fried pickle appetizer it was clearly a frozen appetizer so i knew what to expect but this also arrived cold and soggy all and all not a terribly positive experience given the vast wealth of takeout options in the area|they claimed on their website that they have the best wings in town as a seeker of good wings let me tell you about my adventure with this place everything started fine with our order of  wings with three separate sauces for  eaters the wings arrived exactly an hour later with the exact number of wings promised and a side of celery heres the catchthere was no sauce my party of three decided to just tough it out and eat the wings plain they were i kid you not so bland that i wasnt sure what i was eating they literally just threw the wings in the fryer and delivered it to us so once we realized how unbearable the plain wings were we called and complained about the sauce about  minutes later the sauce arrived at this point the wings got cold and our hunger turned into an unbearable rage we tried bbq garlic parmesan and spicy the sauces were just average the spicy sauce was so weak that i shouldve just settled with a bottle of sirracha the deliver guy gave us a cannoli as an apologyone cannoli eaters you get the point but this gives me the chance to tell you how terrible the cannoli was the outer shell was soggy and the filling made me gag a little it looked nice but didnt taste that great so after  hour and  minutes  wings  sauces and a cannoli we have  very unhappy customers the wings were the most mediocre wings i have ever tasted i will not order here again for the wings nor will i recommend it to the fellow wings connoisseurs out there final verdict most mediocre wings in town|this is a good coop for pittsburgh stocking up on local items and friendly staff however i was surprised at the teeny tiny amount of fresh food my normal experience with coops includes massive amounts of produce dairy baked goods and meats not here though instead its like a coop in miniature even the mozzarella i was looking for came only in tiny olivesized balls dont get me wrong  i fully support the existence of a coop especially in an area like the east end but to be honest i think a trip to the strip district would be much more productive shoppingwise|this is sort of a niche place for me its a bit too expensive for the average person i think and yes i understand that its a coop etc but it doesnt change that its probably middle to upper class prices by comparison but it does offer some deals its the best place to buy spices because theyre sold in bulk and if you want to try something new or only need a little for a recipe you dont have to buy a whole bottle there is an entire aisle of spices spice blends and dried herbs so there is a lot to choose from its also great to buy a little at a time because you can make sure your spices are always fresh same goes for the bulk food bins though probably half of them are the  flavors of granola they stockthe salad bar has great variety the hot food bar not so much it runs out quickly and its too easy to run up a high tab if the good stuff is weighty im not a fan of most of the packaged fresh food in the deli case the stuffed grape leaves are not good and a lot of the other things seem sort of bland to metheres an extensive vitamins and supplements section with pretty much any herbal supplement youd want the produce section is expensive but almost always very fresh|ooooppssupdate time   got the regular steamed spinach and lasagna from the hot bar on my way to work   so im on my dinner break sitting chatting it up with a co worker while eating  i see something white in the spinach just before putting it in my mouth  wtf is that  omg it looks like one of those fat ass worms wed  pluck from the greens in my grandmas garden  i threw the fork down and my co worker says youre seeing stuff  um not  i sat there digging through the spinach determined to find that damn worm  thirty minutes later  shazamfound it ugh my coworker spread open the spinach leaf  eeekkkk it was bigger and fatter with black spikes poking out  fuck  call the manager at coop and he saysbring it in for a refund thanks for being so nice about itwe usually just see worms in the fruits  geez thanks for that lil tidbit    this happened last week around the sept    guess that means its really organic huh|this was a really interesting adventure initially i wasnt too impressed with the produce section where it was pretty limited and only some of the fruits were worth buying the self serve section was enormous and definitely worth checking out there are a few things here that you may not find anywhere else my interest in the food there was a little curbed by the prices which you could easily beat at  a regular grocery store however the raw milk and goat milk there was an interesting find though its a bit out of the way but if im ever near bakery square i would definitely drop by|over all i like it but its not going to be my main grocery run i like having all the organic options especially for the produce beans and grains i hate the parking situation and their prices are significantly higher than i expect even for organic|the products and service are great but the prices are outrageousi am on a vegan diet and have found this coop really helpful if you can get past the prices the selection is great|this coop is probably great for vegans and vegetarians but i am paleo  i was very happy to find grassfed butter raw milk and cheese at reasonable prices  the bulk foods section was missing a few mainstay items i typically pick up and the meat selection was very poor  i would like to see a better listing of which meat is grass fed and grass finished as many of the farms in the frozen meat section did not have any of that informationfor my future needs i will be ordering directly from the farm this coop sells items from the farm that i will be direct ordering from at a lower price and will fill in the gaps elsewhere|really wide selection of products to choose fromi understand that organic local stuff is a premium purchase over conventional foods and there is a huge community for these types of things to support the local food scenebut damned if im going to pay  for a pound of strawberries when i can get them for sale at kroger for  everything is x more expensive than conventional groceries i can understand paying a little more but i cant do that kind of markup|i have been going to cj since it opened i try to go once a week i have received some good deals there but in the past couple years the prices seem to be higher than they should be for used  overstock items i find myself buying less items than i used to i think if the prices were more reasonable they would sell morea new reuse store has opened in the area nearby they have more reasonble prices and thier building is heated|just got off the phone with a lady from construction junction  normally i have had the best experiences there   all have been very cooperative and helpful  but i guess they are so successful that they are becoming arrogant  heres the rub  my hubby sent me a picture of a chandelier they had i did not see the picture until  minutes later by then he had left the store  i called to buy the chandelier over the phone  this has been done before we were construction junction junkies  the lady adamantly refused to help me she adamantly refuesed to even listen to a description of the fixture  she gave the following excuses well if you have been here in the last  years you know how this place works  i cant go back there and try to find out what you want i am the only one on the floor this is first come first serve if your husband comes in and it is still here then well sell it to him  how will i know which one it is  we have so many back there  i could hear the smirk in her voice as she enjoyed blowing me off    i even offered to send her the picture my husband sent me via email  she refused  keep in mind i wanted to pay for the item  my husband cannot go back to construction junction today   most likely the item will be gone   it would have been nice had this  sales agent been more helpful  especially when it was clear how badly i wanted to buy the fixture  she did not express any concern whatsoever for my requests  like so sorry i cant help you at the moment please call back and ill try to accomodate give me a brief description and ill try to find it etc  sometimes even if you cant accomodate someone its how you say it that makes all the difference  construction junction will implode if it begins to treat its customers indifferently|i bought a  piece dorm set last week bedchestdesk and i was supposed to get a chair for the desk   i didnt have a truck when i bought it so they would store it for a week for  not bad when i paid the guy behind the counter said they were bundling sets in the back that they were all pretty much the same and decent qualitylike the ones on the floor great thanks fine with me yesterday i rented a van to pick up my stuff i had a  surlyrude guy take my receipt disappear for a while then come back and was really irritated that i hadnt moved my van well you didnt tell me toand not sure how this process works then what really set him off is that i was there alone and he had to move my stuff i am able to help move i just couldnt do it alone but he grabbed piece by piece and got it on the truck at the end i said thank you and i got a final glare getting the stuff home it looked like they took the  most banged up pieces and bundled them for me not anything like the pieces on the floor i get it its usedits asis but did i have to get all  pieces in that condition and also be made to feel like a piece of crap because i need help  i try never to be that person who finds issues with everythingbut i left there feeling embarrassed and upset i didnt need to be treated that way just thought you should know|very primitive bouldering area but the routes were challenging in part due to the lack of a smearable surface plywood kinda painted to look like rocks  mega shitty footholds jibs worn down to shiny scummy nubs that sorely needed cleaning or replacing and a distinct lack of fallfriendliness one old mat to be shared among every  or  walls and an unforgiving floor that thudded every time someone landed on it  not a bargain for a  day pass since the routes did not seem to have been changed very often and all climbs shared the same foot jibs which looked practically permanent the changing room was literally a closetall that griping aside there were some decent climbs the vs were fairly easy but the vvs were exponentially harder i was able to do one vv but my butt was royally kicked on everything else no ego boosts here and the masochist in me awards  stars to this old school climbing gym|pros tons of space and tons of gentleish climbs for the beginnernovicepadawan looots of v vb v vs i think the hardest i saw was a v i dont boulder much more than a v and i found a lot of fun challenging courses it wore me out but i felt like a superstar my local climbing gym is a lot harder that was great they offer to play your music i always appreciate that in a gym its cool to hear other peoples tastes its cool to let my tastes get some air and indeed one tires of the alt s pandora station that said i did feel some interpolsounding pixie dust bewitch my ear drums and i appreciate that i always appreciate being able to rock outfeel cool while simultaneously lunging for the next hold  for a day pass and shoes was not terrible it wasnt great either but it wasnt terrible and whats in between a pro and a con easy parkingcons a lot of the walls felt way too tall to be lacking a top rope id guess some of the tallest walls were  ft  and dude falling  feet on a bouncy floor is still super dangerous especially if you fall in between a tarzan lunge and thus awkwardly they had a few mats which were strategically positioned and thus couldnt be moved but even with those under me i didnt feel so good they felt little thicker than a down comforter dude come on i didnt break my neck but my muscles were all atrembly my hands slick with sweat and it was sheer terror that often kept me from lunging tarzanstyle to the next hold i had to give up on a few climbs just because i didnt feel safe and that is very lame i would have felt a lot safer if the  ft walls were just top ropeable or if they bought some bigger thicker mats and let people drag them around a free helmets not gonna help much if you land on your shoulder i saw a kid wandering around who looked adorable pubescent and a little intimidated it seemed like his first time it broke my heart cuz he seemed to have gotten frustrated after trying a few of the climbs and not being able to get very far i think he left after not very long does the gym offer kids classes or oneonone instruction especially if the persons totally new and under  or something it just seemed like such a shame id hate to have a kid get sour on climbing just because they had an awkward first time people need to be taught this stuff to an extent  for the privilege of chalk seriouslyso overall im happy to have found a decent wall for my visit to da burgh but i dont know if i would be happy living with it as my only goto|this is the only bouldering facility within the city of pittsburgh and mostly i appreciate that we have one at all i do really enjoy going here and go at least once a week i go mostly in the evenings where the crowd is primarily a young adult group and you rarely see childrenive been climbing a bit longer than i had been when i first wrote this review but i still give it  stars if i could give it a  i might give it thatthe bourldering room is pretty big and there are lots of routes at a variety of levels distributed more of less so that each wall has something for everyone in the evenings it gets uncomfortably crowded and has gotten worse in the past few years as the sport has seemed to get more and more popular what gets me the most is that in the  years or so that ive been going here very little has changed meanwhile ive been exploring gyms all over the country that are expanding have textured rather than plywood walls so you can actually smear and have incorporated things like yoga and weight rooms into their memberships why cant pittsburgh have thati hope one day the climbing wall will step up to try and become one of the more progressive gyms you see on the west coast or that someone else moves a gym into the city that will up the antein the mean time this place will do|im giving this the ok rating i am not an experienced climber but a beginner the last climb i went out was a real one in utah with my brother who got me all harnessed up only to instruct me to place my foot and hand level with my head and pull myself up  you can imagine how that went with my golden retriever feverish barking and running below instructing my brother to let me down lolso for a beginner i found the price to be ok i went with a group and paid  for shoe rental and i guess climbing fee we stayed for about two hours we went on a saturday it was very crowded probably  people in the place but there are so many choices you can still get a wall there were several beginner climbs that are easy for anyone with a shred of upper body strength then some v and v and v the other beginner gals i was climbing with found there was a pretty big variation from the vb to v on some of the climbs so sometimes it was better just not to follow the stickers completely if youre a beginner but still looking for variation while bouldering i think safetywise things are bit of a liability here walls are high mats are very old and very few also lots of people dont follow the basic rules including teenagers who are there alone so be cautious of your space an d others space and consider fatigue when getting to the top of those walls with your hands all sweaty i also expected it to be a little larger based on the website photos but i understand that this is pittsburgh not a city with room for a huge gym like out west i also think if they were to build a bigger newer gym here with higher climbs then you would be looking at paying  and up my biggest complaint is that you can only do lessons at certain times with a harness this makes it harder for beginners to get in and get a feel i did complete one or two v or v just to push myself but i would have had more fun if i had the support of a rope so the next time i go back i will consider classes which costs a little bit more but oh well class times are limited check the website|its a bit silly to review tcw as it is basically the only game in town for rock climbingthat said ive been climbing here at least twice a week for the last few months its not as large and the walls arent as hightech as other places ive climbed but the setters make good use of whats availableboth the bouldering and toproping routes seem to be reset at just about the right rate  there are always newish routes but the turnover isnt so fast that one cant work on problems for a few successive visitsi would love to see the walls refreshed in a cement fauxrock style with more flowing curves and less strict geometry also plywood is slippery makes it hard to smear|dirty slick holds hate the fact i cant move mats some problems were fun some were awful the staff is very unfriendly unless youre part if the clique no one will talk to you|subpar setting quality infrequent wall resetting inconsistent grading poor climate control poor air quality no chalk filter silly rule where they make everyone wear paper wristbands before entry   star because they are finally installing air conditioning|there are some really good things to say about the climbing wall but overall i was quite disappointed  i wanted to like this place so ill start with the positive aspects  first of all the gym in pretty cheap  and the bouldering area is really quite good  to be honest this should only be a bouldering gym there were a lot of different volumes nice routes some top outs and a good cave area  even a small crack with a few problems set on it it seems like whoever is in charge of setting the boulder problems really has some talent  i might be back to bolder once in a blue moon  the other climbers here were pretty cool so the place might have a good vibecommunity aspect now the downsides  the staff wasnt very helpful  the rules regarding the top rope area are nonsensical and the only reasoning offered up was insurance i wanted to belay for a friend but he wasnt allowed in the top rope area unless belay tested belay testing also cost  and i hate when gyms charge for a test  its poor form the ropes arent doubled up and with the short wall it gives way too much pull  they require you to clip into daisy chains on the ground  i wanted to lead climb but there was no one at the gym that could give a lead test the tr routes were really hit or miss a lot of them just confusing and not fun they arent rated properly just easy medium or hard the walls are painted plywood so smearing is basically impossible  further i question if the holds have ever been cleaned  some of them are so polished to the point that its dangerous  theres only once changing room and overall the place isnt very clean  i believe there is some potential here but it seems to be mismanaged and on the whole a missed opportunity|admittedly i am spoiled as ive been in denver for the past  years where we have many climbing gyms to choose from so my opinion is a little biased if you are into bouldering the climbing wall is awesome there is a huge bouldering room with tons of problems bouldering though is not my jam i love climbing the climbing space is much smaller than bouldering and compared to the gyms in colorado much shorter routes  moves to the top  ft there are  routes that are changed regularly rating of these routes are easy  mod  and hard  cant be too disappointed though because i was actually pleasantly surprised there was even a climbing gym here|service was okay at best i wouldnt go there again  they quoted me at thousands of dollars of repairs for my car to pass inspection  i took it somewhere else and had it done for a fraction of the quote|lamb burger was outright badtasted off and charred we shared and together only ate half the filet was decent but not  worth of decent waiter was kind and the ambience is romantic but at the end of the day the food just wasnt that good there are lots of great byos in the city and in my opinion this isnt one of them|cool atmosphere  decent food  and love byob entrees werent out of this world but would recommend the goat cheese appetizer it was my favorite thing of the night|i was underwhelmed with our dining experience we are just learning portuguese for an upcoming trip to brazil and were excited about the option of using some of the vocab we had learnedmenu was somewhat limited although we didnt try any starters which many of the other reviews state are the best offerings on the menu i ordered the seafood stew and my husband had the chicken dish the stew had seafood clams mussels shrimp scallops and some type of summer sausage but not much else the broth was oily my husbands chicken was prepared adequately however the rice it was paired with was extremely underdone while the veggies were overcooked and mushy i might go back once more with a bottle of wine for appetizers only but for the price i will dine on entrees elsewhere|when i entered i was ready to wowed it was my kind of place  byo shabbychic decor intimate setting condensed menu and a waitress with an accent but our food didnt live up to my expectations the portuguese bread served before our meal was crusty warm and special  a cross between a french loaf and cornbread unfortunately things went down hill from here the highly recommended goat cheese and phyllo dough tart was too rich and too mild the pears didnt give enough sweetness and there wasnt any salt so it was just creamy plain and creamy  between us we had three entrees the salmon was my favorite of the three it was an interesting preparation and well done but nothing special the monk fish special was too sweet for my taste and a bit tough i dont want to have to use a knife to cut my fish i appreciated the homemade pasta and delicate flavors of the ravioli but it was just too bland a bit of salt or spicy or something would have been nice i may come back to try the burger but no more  disappointing entrees for me|recently dined here for the first time and can say that i was pleased with all of the food choices we had made at this establishment the cold prickly pear soup was certainly a good choice of appetizer the service was acceptable and the staff very welcoming the only downside to this place is the atmosphere it can get extremely loud at times especially when you are sitting next to a party of  and it becomes rather difficult to have any table conversation|cafe zinho is a cute little restaurant tucked away on a street corner in shadyside that serves up portuguese food everything looked great on the menu but execution was flawed through out our meal also their dishes are not really portuguesefor appetizers we got chicken livers and portuguese bread pudding with mushroom cream sauce the chicken livers lacked flavor which is unfortunate because chicken livers on their own are not very tasty the bread pudding was pretty good thoughentrees were on the whole not impressive the lamb chops were obviously over cooked we ordered medium rare and the insides were almost fully cooked the duck breast which people raved about online were tough and the sauce was too sweet the seafood stew lacked flavor the lamb burger was also overcooked|this place is just lovely when you walk in its inviting and cozy youd never know it was an old garage plus its byob so thats always a perk lets add in super friendly service and its a wine i mean win i had high hopes especially with how much i loved the ambiance i love tomato bisque so i was excited to dive into that for a first course but it was very strangely thin when you imagine bisque you imagine heavy cream used but i believe it was broth based i just wasnt digging it but then our starter came out a goat cheesestuffed puff pastry and it was divine things were looking up it was a delicious mix of cheese plus light and airy puff pastry that we gobbled up me and a friend split two main courses the butternut squash ravioli with pumpkin coulis and the lamb burger with fontina and caramelized onions i love lamb and i love squash so this was the perfect splitting combo i was pretty bummed when the lamb burger while good lamb didnt give off a lot of flavor which was surprising considering it also had caramelized onions which usually pack a flavorful punch the butternut squash ravioli also didnt offer the flavors imagines mostly it was the sauce that seemed to fall flat with this dish there was a sweet ending my friends this cute little mason jar filled with layers of fresh raspberries cream and portuguese cookies was an amazing finish i only wish everything had been equally as amazingi still feel like im not done with cafe zinho so hopefully the next visit will be all wines er wins|the food was innovative yet underwhelming the ambiance was causal and quaint but not something i would recommend or choose to do again parking was hassle a reservation is necessary and make sure to not show early there is no space to wait unless you dont mind sitting outside i typically wouldnt but as the weather begins to turn it becomes increasingly difficult to enjoy the outdoors it seems that breakfast or brunch could be a smashing hit here but after my dinner which i was so looking forward to im not positive that im prepared to put this adventure at the top of my list|the frick car and carriage museum is interesting and fun they play very informative short films in a screening room and the docents there are very friendly helpful people the car and carriage museum is very well worth going to and the amazing part is that is free the frick art museum is not really that interesting or great there is hardly anything of note as far as i can see helen frick had way more money than taste and money cant buy you taste when jp morgan died he donated his entire art collection to the met in new york however the met did not want everything helen frick bought many pieces that the met had already passed on with good reason of course not all of the frick art collection consists of the mets castoffs there many portraits of insignificant nobility done by french court painters who had little talent just bec art is old or expensive doesnt mean its really any good its a good thing this museum is free|its free and the car  carriage museum has a rollsroyce silver ghostwe skipped the house tour  the cafe and the art museum   it was still worth visiting just for the old cars|very nice home and grounds  i could not exactly say i am a fan of the owner or how he earned his money but i did appreciate how original the house and belongings are and how beautiful the grounds and buildings are   can you say johnstown flood  how about the homestead strike  celebrating the extreme wealth of few on the backs of a billion who worked  hour days for nothing isnt exactly something i really love to do but i can appreciate beautiful art and architecture of which there is plenty to see here  we toured clayton the home art museum conservatory and the car and carriage museum  the conservatory didnt have a lot of impressive specimens and was far from full but is a great building  be sure to earmark about  hours for the whole experience including perhaps a pricey but tasty snack at the cafe make a reservation  we had a really nice time and i do recommend a visit if you are here so you can not only see some great furnishings but so that you may learn some of the history of the economy here  after all we shouldnt turn our backs on the reality of our collective history lest we make the same mistakes again  i am glad they are doing such a fine job preserving this place for generations to come|the art museum is pretty nice the carriage and car museum is cool and its neat to walk through the greenhouse  those are free  however nothing really separates the  house tour from other house tours  like the other ones the docents dont focus on anything interesting like history or the architecture or the building itself  they focus on some family story that may only be of passing interest because the family is rich  kind of like hearing about paris hilton or the kardashians  boring and what kind of tourist attraction doesnt allow pictures|this shop allows you to bring aftermarket parts and charges a reasonable labor charge  prior to going to this shop we went for a second opinion on the  accord and they recommended replacing struts and ball joints  angels swapped only the struts but told us to bypass the ball joints even though we had the parts in handa few months later we go back to change brake pads and tires  they did a good job with installing the new parts but they changed their mind and recommended to replace the ball jointshow could they recommend replacing them after saying they were ok in such a short time period|okay  heres an update to my original experience  i have to say that emilio the owner of izzazu is the consumate professional when it comes to customer service and follow up  after my first appointment  at that time to be my last appointment  he doggedly tried to contact me to make the first appointment right  emilio and i had quite a lengthly and productive conversation  he cares very much about making the customer happy and correcting the situation that was unsatisfactory  i did go back and was very pleased with my cut once again  because marshall was running late  minutes and counting caesar cut my hair this time  another great cutagain however the desk needs training in customer service  after a  minute wait the receptionist still hadnt notified marshall that i was there   a downtown salon depends on clients who are on their lunch hours for the most part  next appointment ill call ahead to see how theyre running before heading to the salon and waitingemilio is working on the front desk situation  in the meantime ill continue to go for the wonderful cut|i am a jack of all trades and a do it yourselfer at heart while in college i worked as a promotional photographer for my very dear friends salon as a barter service she always did my hair for free  years i had this deal going on as you can imagine i was pretty spoiled and didnt want to start paying to get my hair did i began coloring it myself now as a licensed skin care specialist you pick things up from the cosmetologists working with youi killed it fried it and melted it my hair was in dire straights i have dark hair but i love being a red head marcia cross red to be exact whoops lightening that many levels should not ever be done by a novice what can i say  im stubborn that way and think i can do it all i reached out to emilio for help i have to say that after many hours of laying down color he managed to make my hair healthy again and i left feeling like a movie star a red headed movie star i was flipping my hair all the way to the parking garage and even did a photoshoot later that evening yes i did a photoshoot because i needed a professional head shot for my work portfolioi dont know if im being too harsh but my hair did turn out much darker than i had wanted it to be i know sometimes it is hard to predict the outcome when mixing chemistries the other problem i had was the price tag or the surprise when i went to pay  for a color correction i know this is normal sometimes when fixing the damage but it is also crucial to give your client some kind of idea on payment i had gone in for color estimated at around  i think they did a decent job but for that money it should have been closer to what i asked for needless to say i havent been back but would recommend in a jam|i recently had semipermanent lashes put on for my wedding at the wexford izzazu salon upon completion i thought they looked a bit odd but figured i just wasnt used to them yet the next day was my wedding day and my bridesmaids and i got our hair and makeup done at the downtown izzazu salon the makeup artist who was great said they looked terrible which they did they were uneven and there was white glue all over them and had to remove them and reapply they are supposed to last  weeks so removing them the next morning was very unpleasant and i ended up losing a ton of my real lashes when everything was said and done this added  hour onto my appointment and i ended up barely having any time for pictures before my wedding i would steer clear of izzazu for semi permanent lashes|i bought a groupon that advertised  for a shampoo  cut and style that was regularly    discount   all of that was great craig did my hair and he was excellent and professional  my problem is the price of the groupon  i didnt get to choose one of the hairdressers which i totally understand  however when i was leaving i wanted to leave a tip based on the full cost of the service  not the groupon price i asked the receptionist and she said that the service i received was  thats nowhere near  off i just feel that i was mislead|we were wanting to order takeout one night and looked through our folder of coupons to pick a place after being pizzad out we decided to try miaettas due to their  deal wings hoagie fries and a soda the food was good nothing spectacular the wings were sort of dainty though i feel they compensated by giving us more than a dozen the garlic parm sauce was also very light they could have been a bit more generous we ordered the miaetta hoagie which was pretty much like a club once again good but nothing to write home about i could have made the same sandwich myself fries were standard one thing to add  i found it strange that they only had four sodas to choose from pepsi mt dew a generic juice and something else considering this place is extremely close to us i would stop back to try other things on the menu according to the other reviews on yelp their gourmet italian food is what theyre known for now we know what to order next time my boyfriend said the scene on the inside was very old fashioned and homey so id love to check them out again but perhaps dining in rather than takeout i love nothing more than a good ole mom and pops kitchen|the place is fine and i can see it having a warm place in peoples hearts if they went there as a young child  i imagine i have a similar place for dairy queen dipped cones since there used to be a dq within two blocks of my house when i grew up  regardless at the end of the day the ice cream itself is just good and is certainly nothing great or special  when i visited i had some soft serve and they offer lots of flavor options however were not talking glens custard or anything of that level of taste or creaminess  its just some allaround standard or above average soft serve not much moreatmosphere  i can understand having a long attachment to the place based on the atmosphere  page dairy mart really attempts to show its history by seemingly keeping things oldfashioned and i imagine the exterior and many elements have stayed the same for generationsat the end of the day this is a good place for some ice cream  nothing fantastic  nothing to travel across the city state or country to visit  certainly not something worthy of a perfect five stars|i came in on a groupon  they were kind to squeeze me in the same day i called and within the hour  however when i got there it appeared the stylist didnt know yet so when the one receptionist left to tell him the other said to her hes going to kill you  granted i didnt know what they were talking about but whatever that statement meant it didnt make me feel welcomedbut when the stylist washed my hair he literally only massaged the shampoo into half of my head rinsed it out for  seconds and finished washing my hair in the speediest time everhe also went on to give me the fastest haircut ive ever had  when i asked for side bangs he basically refused and just trimmed my hair that would be side bangs  and when i told him my that my hair is naturally shiny and i dont like products in it he still put oil in my hair without asking  he was nice and did a nice job blowdrying my hair but i was very disappointed with my cut|i have lived in the area of pages dairy mart for about  yrs i have always enjoyed the ice cream until this day i ordered an artic swirl chocolate ice cream with chocolate chip cookie dough i have ordered this same item over and over again when i took first taste no chocolate chip cookie dough pieces second taste same thing third taste same thing and so on for approximately  or  tastes i took the cup with remaining up to counter and asked them to remake i was denied told it would waste their money nothing about mine what i had ordered was more expensive than plain chocolate ice cream they dumped what was in the medium cup into a small and handed back to me well it wasnt even a medium desert since it fit into a small cup i even tipped the girl  when i first received my desert i will never return to make any other purchases i will however return to express my disdain to the owner when i can find him there i hope he reads this|its an average ice cream place  no more no less you can have the same products that taste the same at any dairy queen or tastee freeze people give this place  stars because they like to think theyre special by knowing about some small ma and pop place|this place was just okay i had the cookie sundae and my fiance had the brownie sundae we both kind of watched horrified as the girl making our sundaes ran our cookies and brownies through a warmer in one of those cheap plastic containers i mean i know im eating ice cream which is sooo healthy but a little cancer from warming up plastic with the food youre gonna eat never hurt anyone eitherthe price for the sundaes seemed a little high to me at first but the more i ate the more i realized we really did get our moneys worth this is definitely better than dairy queen and it has a good ice cream shop atmosphere if youre looking for some good soft serve treats|overhyped i thought that pages tasted like an average softserve ice cream shop i was also surprised about the lack of flavors that they offered there was no cookies and cream or sorbetsi ordered a small chocolate chip ice cream with rainbow sprinkles and my boyfriend ordered the strawberry shortcake sundae my chocolate chip ice cream tasted identical to breyers boxed ice cream from the grocery store i may have ordered the wrong item but because it is softserve ice cream they dont offer samples my boyfriend had the strawberry shortcake sundae which had  pieces of cake on the bottom  scoops of vanilla ice cream strawberry syrup strawberries not fresh almonds and whipped cream it was huge and they didnt allow him to swap flavors or make any adjustmentsmaybe my expectations of pages were too high but when i had heard about this ice cream shop whose line wrapped down the street i knew i had to check this place out when i went on a friday night there was no line and the ice cream was subpar|its ok if you like soft serve and enormous amounts of it  i am not a huge soft serve fan and i find the flavour of paiges very bland  so i t tastes like cold sweet and thats about it  the atmosphere is great and its worth a trip come here once just for that  i dont think it is worth a second trip though|i have been driving by this little bakery for several years now and always wanting to stop in and try it  unfortunately they are usually closed when i have the time to stop  i was finally lucky enough to find them open at a time when i had a chance to stop and pop in  the cases were less than half full and i found this a tad disconcerting and so asked the lady behind the counter why they were so empty  she said they they normally sell out of most of their fare very early in the day  luckily they did have a small yellow cake with butter cream frosting  i ordered one and took it homethe cake was good but it wasnt as good as some of the other bakeries in the pittsburgh metro  i would never crave it but i would return if the other bakeries were closed at the time|maybe i went on a bad night but the service was stunningly bad  water glasses stayed empty for almost  minutes  ordered  dishes all pretty average  the tab    i wont be back|seated in the bar after having made reservations a week in advance that paired with a mediocre menu and overall experience gives this two stars save your money and stay in town i would probably send you to the gasp olive garden before i referred you here|my boyfriend  i went to alla famiglia for our late valentines day dinner last night we dont go out  splurge like this often so we were really excited for a special dinner the food was out of this world bread  sides salad pasta alla vodka and veal chop milanese but the service was absolute garbage ive seriously been treated better at a tgifridays we waited pretty much unattended to at the bar until  for an  reservation once seated i practically had to beg for a wine list we called a cab at the end of our meal and decided to get drinks  wait back at the bar the cab was taking forever so we called a different company as my boyfriend was talking with the cab company a waitress walked by we heard her walk into the kitchen and loudly announce to the rest of the staff ugh those people at the bar are just now ordering a cab it was  on a saturday nighti dont know if it was the fact that we were some of the youngest patrons in there earlymid s but we felt talked down to and disrespected the entire time maybe if we were in our s like everyone else they wouldve treated us like adultswhen i plunk down  for one of the most highlyrecommended restaurants around i expect to be treated like im spending  at your restaurant despite how great the food was i wont be returning so disappointed|the food was delicious but it is a ridiculously expensive restaurant if youre intimidated by spending  or more on a complete meal for  person then this is not the place for you knowing that we had other plans for our evening my date and i cut the meal short with appetizers salad and a bottle of one of the lesser expensive wines they offer which was  a bottle our check was still  and we left hungry which is a shame because the little of what we did have we fully enjoyed there are plenty of italian restaurants in pittsburgh and many of them are very very good  where one can enjoy a meal for a fraction of what it costs here|okay i have never eaten there before last night but i have eaten at davios and that is what the atmosphere reminded me of we were there a total of  hours start to finish  hours until our main course was served but many courses are served as you wait most of them were delicious they bring you out fresh delicious warmed bread at the beginning with a garlic oil sauce dubbed holy oil and it truly is heavenly they also have a bowl of cheese and garbanzo beans to eat atop of the bread delicious there is also a cheesy spread available all were wonderful then about  minutes later they brought our appetizer it was a soupylooking mushroom appetizer with a sweet flavor i do not recommend this app it wasnt good then about  minutes after that a salad was served it came dressed and was one of the best ive had  minutes after that the highlight of the dinner came pasta in a bowl it was the best part of the dinner finally another long time after that  our main course came mine looked only slightly better than it tasted i got the seafood diavolo and it was a huge disappointment i really liked our waiter  he was very busy but attentive  but i cursed him under my breath for recommending this main course i was so close to ordering a pasta dish which im certain i would have loved and devoured but i was talked out of ordering pasta because pasta comes with dinner i wish our waiter would have asked me what i liked sauces etc before recommending this dish  for something you give to your cat is a hard pill to swallow i love seafood but i enjoy it in butter sauces lemony butter sauces alfredo sauces wince sauces with garlic not this red soupy dish it was literally like eating cold tomatoes and water with tabasco sauce poured in it looked like seafood soup all the delicious seafood was drowning in a dark red spicy soupy mess i wanted to cry when i saw it then i tasted it and really wanted to cry it was gross this is the last dish i would have ever ordered had i known how it was presented i looked around at my date who had a massive veal tenderloin in front of him and i was so jealous wishing i had went with my first instinct  the pasta  or even the halibut anything that wasnt drowning in a spicy red soup i just hope that staff read this and never recommend this dish to a firsttimer especially someone who enjoys seafood they can actually taste that isnt drowning in some spicy tomato sauce if this dish wasnt so awful i would have given  stars the only other bad dish was the mushroom appetizer and it was also a soupy mess but i would eat the mushroom app  times a day for the rest of my life if it came down to that and the seafood diavolo|this was my second time to ala famiglia  its been a few years and we figured the saturday after thanksgiving would be perfect for italian  a welcome break from turkeyunexpected and awful problem with our experienceour party of nine was seated onetime for our  pm reservation  drink orders were taken bread and assorted accoutrements of oil and such were brought to the table  waitress was pleasant holiday tunes playing over  separate speakers in the small upstairs bartable area  quality sound something i appreciate and muted penn state football game on the flat screen  we were settled in for a good meal  appetizers arrived approximately an hour later  they were quite good  the  ounce meatball was fantastic  it was covered in a great tomato sauce and hit the spot   we ordered the calamari and even a second round of the prosciutto wrapped prawns  pasta arrived  it was good but it should be at ala famiglia  the dinners arrived at    yes it was a  reservation  at least it gave our brunello time to breath   the portions were big  lots of veal dishes rib eyes and filets   non cooked too long or too short  so why the mediocre review  the long wait  no   we were in good company and enjoyed being together  the problem was the large number of fruit flies that were all over our table  i first noticed them in one of the empty cocktail glasses  they liked the remnants of the manhattan  and the cherry left in the glass   three of them dead two more flew away when i waived my hand  that caused me to look over at my wine glass holding the  per bottle brunelloyep one dead and one alive  what do you do  i fished out the dead one and covered my glass with a cocktail napkin  this was pretty disgusting  we mentioned it to the waitress but she didnt respond or summon a manager  not looking for a free meal or anything but as a business owner myself i would think they would want to know about the problem and get it rectified asap  i like the food but i wont likely be back  oh and for the  people the meal was just shy of a |pretty good food i felt so miserably full afterwards i think the things that come with the meal are far better than the meal itself i really enjoyed the warm bread and the salad with candied walnuts family style pasta was included as well if i go back again id only want those things|rating the overall experience we had herefirst off this is family style multicourse meal  every main dish comes with a salad and pasta dish to share  the salad is one of the best salads i remember eating and could easily be enough for an appetizer  the pasta tossed in a vodka sauce was just ok  the homemade pasta is not actually made in house i asked but it is fresh which im assuming meant bought from a store on the strip or a market districtwe had also ordered the calamari and the meatball appetizer because we were starving and that proved to be way too much food for a family of   if you must get an appetizer i highly recommend the meatball you will not regretthe veal chop is easily the best thing on the menu and where alla famiglia really shines  from all the pasta plates and steaks and seafood dishes that were ordered at our table the veal chop was by the unanimous favorite at our table  incredible flavors and tender cuts but by the time you get to the main course youre full with the bread salad and pasta that comes before you cant really enjoy it fully  most plates come with a side of their grilled veggies which again were ok but some dishes come with nothing so i would make sure to ask if you need a side   so long story short this is a marathon and dont expect to be done in an hour and a half  pace so you can really enjoy that veal chop at the endwhen you first walk in it seems very small but there are back rooms and stairs that go up one or two floors  theres also a back patio one floor up from ground floor  its tight sitting spaces but very cute and authentically italian  so now that we established that the ambiance and food are pretty solid the thing that earned this  stars is how we were hosted to our table  we had a reservation at pm and were minutes early which we recognize is nowhere near to our reservation time so we elected to grab drinks and sit on the patio  when  comes around we inquire about our table only to be told that there was not a sitting space yet which would be ok minus the fact that there were multiple tables open that we asked about   we asked again and were told that they were setting up a table immediately   comes around and were still not seated so had to ask the hostess again which apologized and sat us at the table we had asked about  minutes ago when our reservation time was  it took  minutes to seat us at our table for our reservation time of  when there were tables openit was a frustrating experience because everyone was hungry and we werent even offered bread sitting on their patio  the frustration unfortunately set the mood for the dinner and although our food was great we didnt really enjoy the time we had here we really wanted to love alla famiglia  perhaps well try one more time and hope our experience is better|i do not say this with many  star ratings but i would like to go back for another try  the reason is simple in reading the reviews below i have to assume we hit alla famigilia on a bad night at least i hope so  the main reason for the low rating was the service  we were seated on the third floor which is their bar area at a high top table and the bar tender was our server  she had to mix drinks for every table on the third floor tend to the patrons at the bar and come around to wait on our table  that was not fair to her and definitely not fair to us  her service and attentiveness lacked for obvious reasons but even when she was free she walked by our table without a glance and was apparently hard of hearing  furthermore when ever one person got her attention for another drink or something she said okay and left without giving anyone else a chance to order  the rest of the staff tried to pick up the slack a little but they were jammed as well  sounds weird but i never felt so rushed in a  hour dinner  the food took awhile which is fine and expected on a busy saturday night just keep the drinks flowing and stop by once in a awhile so we dont noticei also did not like that we were seated at a high top table  i love the high tops for drinks and a few apps but for a  hour meal these were uncomfortable especially if your legs didnt hit the chair cross bars correctly either too short or too tallthe food was good very good in some instances and disappointing in one  i loved the pasta with vodka sauce and the salad both part of the entree which is unusual for a high end restaurant  the meatball appetizer and the calamari and shrimp appetizer were the best things i ate all evening  the biggest disappointment was the veal chop  i love a good bone in veal chop but was leaning towards a seafood dish i ended up changing my mind right before i ordered as i saw the veal chop brought out to another table and it looked amazing  the disappointment was it was overcooked  it came out medium well at best closer to well and for  and for the amount they were serving that night they should know how to cook them to perfection  not a spot of pink to be found  no one even asked us during our meal if everything was okay or any issues  when most of the chop remained on my plate and everyone elses entree was  eaten not even a was everything okay  just clear me out and get on with the next onei hope to have the opportunity to go back and i will not be seated in the third floor bar area and i will not get my same waitress and give it another try  i expected so much more|i enjoyed my meal at alla famiglia the service is great and the atmosphere is ok a little oddly decorated for such a highend eatery however i dont know that the food was so good that it justified the high price point this place is expensive and reserved for special occasions which i knew coming in but i wasnt really that blown away by my meal you do get a lot of food but walking away with  bill for a group of  just seems over the top when you consider the fact youre eating mostly pasta|we had the mushrooms meatball appetizer pasta salad veal piccata and spaghetti with clam sauce a nice pasta dish with roasted veggies and marinara was made as a special order but i was not wowed by this restaurant large portions are not enough to impress me the tastes were good but for the prices id expect better if youre a big meat eater or love to eat huge amounts of pasta ok this is great but the sauces were just ok nothing spectacular spaghetti with clams was covered with red pepper flakes but not noted as such on the menu would you like someone to cover your pizza slice with red pepper flakes without asking im sure the deserts are good but we didnt have any  but the sizes of the appetizers and entrees is just over the top but not worth the premium prices to me|for convenient takeout chinese this place is the bomb my judge of chinese takeout depends on the quality of their hot  sour soup this soup is lovely with big chunks of tofu and little mushrooms floating throughout it  though id prefer some more exotic mushrooms thrown in too overall this place has quick service and throws in lots of big chunks of fresh vegetables whens the last time you had vegetable fried rice with chunks of bell pepper broccoli pea pods and onion the kung pao chicken could be spicier but next time ill ask the allentown neighborhood of  no  china house is its major detractor id be concerned about safety heading up there at night for delivery however youll get all your basics quickly and be happy with your order|the name is abc garden and this is the best chinese food ive had in pittsburgh  this place completely satisfies my chinese food craving when i want that balance between fried deliciousness and fresh ingredients  the neighborhood is kinda dodgy but since they deliver and quick i might add there is no need to tread into sketchville to pick up the delectable chinese offerings   also there are free extras when you order  or more such as a  liter of pepsiupdate  much to my great sadness and disappointment i have had to stop patronizing this establishment due to the extremely rude and unprofessional man they hired to answer the phone  we tolerated it the first few times even got a laugh out of the fact that he actually dropped the f bomb a few times while taking our order   but when he became hostile and irate with me on a recent order it was all over  he started like he always does by laughing at our street name and having me spell it  times then interrupted the order without excusing himself to set down the phone and yell at some children i heard in the background then he argued with me about what the menu in my hand said telling me i was wrong and it said something different  he was aggressive frustrated impatient and clearly has some psychological problems    i had to make the painful decision to give up this place in spite of the lovely fresh vegetables and tofu cooked to perfection    im trying no  kitchen on brownsville instead|well the delivery was fast at least everything else was yucky avoid|its your typical run of the mill chinese take outbut i must say between  moves around the immediate south and a name change theyre now abc garden ive stuck with these guys never had a disappointing encounter with them even with the constant delivery staff changes their all day combos have a huge amount of food and theyre only about  also i prefer my lo mein with sauce only and they dont have any problems accommodating anyone else i order from always seems to have an issue and gives me the gross vegetables too these little points along with quick delivery makes them my goto when i need a quick noodle fix|our experience not so great  we have mortgage as well as basic free checking and savings with dollar in squirrel hill  mortgage application process was brutal  starting with the advertised rate of  being suddenly not available when we decided to lock it in got   automatic deduction of mortgage payment was required to secure this rate and it came out of the required dollar checking account on the first business day of the month  free checking is free  until  beware of funds availability policy  we deposit a check monthly at the end of the month  in august the end of the month was a weekend and labor day was on september   so our check did not get deposited until   mortgage payment hit on  it was paid but we were charged  insufficient funds due solely to funds availability policy  after doing this first dollar then merrily hits us with two more  charges on smaller checks that would have cleared had they been processed before the mortgage payment  had we not been required to submit to automatic deduction of mortgage according to our monthly statement we had at least  days grace to make the payment so dollars requirements and policies trapped us into this situation  moreover there was over  in the associated savings account that was ignored  i called to protest and one of the  fees was waived  then i was offered the deal of overdraft protection from the savings account for an annual fee plus a  transaction fee should this situation ever arise again  needless to say i declined this deal and transferred the savings to the checking account where it sits until i find another bank and then fire dollar|i was thrilled to finally find a yelp review with  stars and only one dollar sign on yelp in the south hills moving from la recently where for some reason everything is more expensive except nail salons now i am by no means a spa rat but i do like to pamper the toes every now and again so one afternoon when i had some spare time i gave them a try i was totally underwhelmed from nail polish in the front with dust on it how long have they been there to sitting in a spa chair with ripped upholstery i felt neither pampered nor impressed i might have looked beyond such things because of the affordable price till i got home and realized that my nails hadnt been cut short as i had very clearly asked nor had she taking care of an ingrown toenail a week later i had to cut my own toes and ruin my all right looking pedicure this place doesnt feel clean or inviting the decor was junkie and old and cluttered i will say that everyone was very friendly and they did take me right away when i walked in i was really pulling for you future nails but sadly i dont see you at all in my future  stars|if it wasnt for how fast and affordable the place is it would have no stars at all i got a fill and a fix because i broke a nail first off they didnt cut down my nails so now they are obnoxiously long second off they are so thin i feel like they are just going to crack off  not to mention it seems very dirty i was very uncomfortable the whole time i was there one of the nail techs was constantly hitting on me i will not be returning again|its pretty average chinese food their egg rolls and dumplings were decent enough as was the hawaii five o dish i had was ok too the service is a little slow as well|heyyyy everyone im gonna try to start up on these again so im new around this side of town and thought id try the chinese restaurant around the corner i call in and order small general tsos with white rice  the menu i see online tells me  she says on the phone that its assuming thats the tax or something like that then tells me it will take mins i get there in  mins and its already done  so i know its not fresh then i go to pay and she says  which is annoying but after that long rant the food wasnt on the fresher side it looked very dry but it was has a really good flavor it isnt spicy at all if thats what youre looking for and idk if they dont do sizes  but if this is a small good lord idk what the large would look like im adding pics flash no flash and updated menu|had hunan wok yesterday because it was on my way home ive heard mixed reviews so i wanted to try it for myself i tried to peruse the menu before ordering but i couldnt find it online anywhere which is disappointing because the hard copy they have available had at least  different options from apps combos sides and entrees i got their general tsos chicken extra spicy and because my order was a takeout over  they threw in two free egg rolls win other offers are free  small fried rice wpurchase of  free general tsos or sesame chicken wpurchase over   i called on my way there and it took about   when i walked in everything was ready to go large portion of chicken was served in plastic and rice was in standard paper folder container they were not stingy about duck sauce soy sauce and fortune cookies win winjust like the reviews below the general tsos was just soso it definitely wasnt extra spicy but it did have a mild kick to it to me the sauce tasted a bit like wing sauce from a dive bar i would get it again because it was good but it didnt have an oriental flavor to it when ordering from a strip mall chinese food place i always expect each piece of general tsos to be a quarter chicken and the rest fatty breading to which i dissect and just eat the meat  my expectations were met but i wasnt disappointed because the chicken was good the meal had a decent amount of broccoli in it which was cooked perfectly for my taste a little firmer the egg rolls were ok super crispy and not much fillingplenty of oil they were free and so i cant really complain  i will definitely eat here again ill probably try sha cha chicken because its spicier or kung po this place is good if you want cheap food that will hit a chinese takeout craving everyone that worked there was really nice  even the chef in the back said hello that alone goes a long way in my opinion side note  its the day after and im not sick so i give my seal of health approval|bishops used to be the best pizza place around but anymore it is mediocre at best it really just depends on when you get it some days its better and other days its not the taste and quality isnt consistent just recently we ordered from bishops and the pizza did not have a lot of cheese and the crust wasnt warm or tasty it just tasted bland i know that this particular location has been for sale but still operating so hopefully new management can turn this place around and make it as good as it always used to be|my first trip here was on a sunday at pm i was surprised to see i was the only customer we were met by friendly staff took our choice of seat and gazed at the menu i wanted a verity so i picked the  pancakes  eggs toast sausage or baconi ordered my eggs scrambled and sausage links i also ordered home fries and a glass of white milk i could smell my food cooking as i waited anxiously  i was starvingmy food was ready in about  minutes and looked tastyall in all good bargain and equal food quality ill give them  starslike a pirmantis it would probably be better if i had been drinking|good breakfast horrible service and im not even one to complain about service one of the waitresses is always in a bad mood with an attitude fire her and ill raise the rating to a solid |wife and stopped in on the way to the steelers game on sunday  victory by the way  i have always passed this place on visits to the burgh since i have moved away but never stopped in  well we miss old fashion diners in the washington dc area  this one when you walk in its like you step back in time to simpler days  the ladies behind the counter we so darn nice and the gent busing tables was super nice to us  we loved the atmosphere  eggs were good and toast with warm melted better good  the hash browns under cooked and the sausage was not so great  but if you want to step back in timethis is the place|i recently bought my first motorcycle a  ktm duke ii and found bohns when searching online for ktm dealers i went in with the intention of buying a jacket helmet and gloves their store is pretty nice inside and they have a good selection of gear mostly dirtoriented though i wasnt quite sure what i wanted so i asked a lady for some assistance in picking out a helmet she was helpful and recommended a jacket that would be usable in different types of weather however a friend who was with me said he had a different type of jacket which they also sold and she commented that the hated that jacket and that the liner was nothing more than a glorified garbage bag okwe also talked to a guy at the register about a  ktm  mxc that my friend just bought and asked a simple question about a clutch cable the guy seemed totally disinterested and clueless and im not really sure if he even knew what a clutch was he ended the conversation by saying that my friend should just throw his bike away because it was so old whateven after that i still bought a jacket from them and ordered a helmet i liked that they had assured me would be in later that week i then got a call from them a few days later saying that the helmet was no longer available but that i could pick another style i then just ordered the helmet online and went back the next day to get a refundi wanted to like this place but between the thinlyveiled insults and seemingly clueless repair staff i dont think ill ever return their prices and selection are pretty decent so if you are in the area and know what you want it might be ok to stop by and pick something up if you have any alternative though i would avoid this place|i usually love this place but its gone bad went to one in wv the other day and it was good i think different owners my beef this one is the cheese very pour quality bread and sauce still good though|the service here can be hitormiss but more often than not i dont have problems usually when my friend and i stop by were waited on by the same server and our food comes up relatively quickly its always fresh too unfortunately when they get busy it creates problems because they dont have a stock of anything prepared which in turn creates delays their cashiers have a habit of walking away from the counter in the evening leaving customers waiting for however long it takes them to notice someone is standing there while i understand that they have to clean up the restaurant for closing there should always be someone to watch the counteras a side note their drivethru speaker went down about a month ago and still hasnt been repaired it creates delays at the drivethru window for placing orders especially later in the evening due to above mentioned cashier habits|someone please change the cooking oil with the construction on rt  it has been a very long time since i decided to put up with the craziness that makes up this intersection a nagging for fried fish however sent my daughter and me to this ljs mistake number  was ignoring the deserted parking lot mistake number  was placing an order at the drive thru and eating our  piece fish and more dinners after the smell of old cooking oil put a damper on our nagging for fried fishthe service at the drive thru was friendly the girl at the window friendly but the smell of old cooking oil not so much not a soul in sight at this ljs yes there are other places to get great fried fish and after our experience perhaps its time to let this ljs walk the plank off our list the fish was edible not the usual crunchy crumbly ljs fish the hush puppies were soggy from either drowning in old oil too long or sitting under heat lamps too long the fries endured the same sad torture as the others cheap yes but not worth the money or rt  traffic anymore|i would never get my nails done here againthey are always very busy the wait time is too long ive just left because it was taking too longthey are very pricey they charge for everything they do to your nailsif you get a design they will charge per lines on nails if you get a white manicure full set and want colored lines underneath it they charge for extra for the colored lines they arent very friendly there at all either|it has rebounded from when it closed in  and now does some veg stuff along with the bar food id still much rather eat up the street at maxs thoughthat said the clientele is nicecolorful  im glad its reopened|interesting place with interesting patrons the drinks are super cheap  and i was pleasantly surprised when i got my bill there are peanut shells all over the place i was a bit concerned initially but then realized that this was acceptable behavior completely a chill place unpretentious a bit dark and different than other bars that i usually frequent in the pittsburgh area im not sure that id make a special trip to this place but its not like im going to try to avoid it if my path leads me here again then ill go with it|who doesnt like a bar where you can eat unlimited salty popcorn and unlimited peanuts for free  and you can throw the peanut shells on the floorjust like home  i mean not really thats just the clothes in my closet  the atmosphere is like one of those bars where you know half the people come in there every night  theres even mugs for them  being an outsider was okay though no weird looks for the regs all are welcomebeer on tap are mixed between the regulars yuengling mad hat guiness and lots of seasonal and rotating beers  i love a place with a good draft offering  im way more into a draft than a bottle  dont ask me whymaybe because the gulps can be biggerperks non smoking best bar choice on east ohio and of course free popcorn and peanutsdid i mention that yetits definitely a great place to chill out with friends on a saturday night and eat a crap load of popcorn|i went to park house after much internal deliberation and after reading all the high reviews from fellow yelpers   this bar is less than  minutes from where i live  i stopped in on a saturday night and was pleased with the music that was playing and also the fact that the bar was not overcrowded the bar tender barely acknowledged me the whole night  there wasnt any free peanuts or popcorn when i visited nor did they have the beer that i like on tap  i did get a very tasty double chocolate stout which i found to be delicious in every way  the owner of the place even gave me an annoyed looksaturday night is usually a crappy night to try out any new place  the service was slow but i got the feeling that the bartender couldnt be bothered to wait on me  i havent completely written this place off  ill just try again during the week|good beer wednesday night is banjo night which always draws a crowd definitely a hipster bar food is fresh  worth trying get a dish that includes the house humus|we visited last night for the bluegrass night being that we dont visit the north side very often this bar wasnt bad long narrow bar with lots of wood and a few tables to sit at they had a good selection of beers on tap that were seasonal and would satisfy any beer lover  the free popcorn and peanuts were a nice touchas for the bluesgrass jam night i cant really recommend it i was worried that it would be a bunch of hipsters standing in a circle pretending to be the lumineers and it was this is not bluegrass  also with a name like bluegrass jam it attracts other sparsely washed hipsters like ants to an overripe peachi would go back just not for the music|some may describe this place little hipsters paradise in the middle of the northside ive been a sporadic customer of the park house since i moved to pittsburgh initially right up the street  years ago the atmosphere is really great a nice historic vibe and a diverse customer basethe food is solid albeit limited due to their small kitchen space i would recommend the hummus more than anything else its the one that thats stood out to us on our visits everything else is decent but nothing specialmy one complaint is the cost of the whisky i think laphroaig  was  for a pour thats way too pricey for a  year old scotch thats only bottle across the street at the wine  spirits otherwise the beer selection is decent as well as their limited but decent bourbon selection overall a great vibe neighborhoody feel and decent service will keep us stopping in whenever were in the area and looking for a small snack and a few drinks|i was here for the wellknown bluegrass night on a wednesday a couple weeks ago and had a pretty good time a friend met up with me here and we were able to enjoy the live music close to the bar and actually meet a few of the locals i enjoyed the crowd it seemed to mostly consist of  and  somethings a bunch of bros some couples single girls and guys we got some of the hummus which was pretty good if someone invited me id definitely stop in again  yuenglings for the bluegrass night thats reason enough to stop in again right|i had heard a lot about their food and decided to check it out one night after purchasing a groupon this review is strictly for the food it was not good the hummus was okay and our main plate seemed to be microwaved the bar ambiance seemed cool though so if you are looking for a bar atmosphere id probably rate this  stars for dinner not that great|more of a  but definitely not a  in my opinion after living in pittsburgh for  years  of which have been spent on the north side i finally stopped in after reading reviews and passing by this bar a hundred timesi arrived on a friday night a few minutes after they opened aside from the bartender and another guy who i came to realize was the owner i was the only person there shortly thereafter the place started filling up with a mostly younger crowdi ordered a beer and enjoyed the free peanuts while i waited for my boyfriend to arrive it took a couple minutes for me to become comfortable throwing the shells on the ground but then it was a lot of fun to dowhen the bf arrived we ordered some food the menu is pretty small but we found something that we would each enjoy he had a burger with sweet potato fries and their gyro i ordered the hummus be prepared for a wait it wasnt until after i ordered that i saw a mention on the bottom of the menu asking for patience as the food is prepared yah we waited about  minutes as the only person preparing all the food is the owner by the way the food prep area is close to the bar i figured this out after i kept hearing a microwave go off every minute the hummus was served with two warm pitas not sliced i didnt dislike the taste but didnt love the hummus ill instead stick with hummus from alladins  the boyfriend noted that he enjoyed the burger and gyro although the gyro didnt look like a traditional gyro one would usually order i tried his sweet potato fries and again wasnt thrilledwell likely give them another try sometime soon but might stick to eating somewhere else first or only grabbing an appetizer hereambiance  service  food  |stopped in to the park house on a recent tuesday evening the place was pretty full with people participating in their weekly trivia night although it looked like a lot of fun we didnt take partmy boyfriend was hungry and thirsty i was just thirstyalthough it was only around  in the evening the majority of people were drinking  not eating as i mentioned in my first review of this restaurant the menu is pretty small also all of the food is pretty much prepared by the owner at one end of the bar he uses microwaves to heat up just about everything the food isnt bad its just not great and theres absolutely nothing special about it so do yourself a favor and come here for beermy boyfriend ordered the gyro and hummus platter i noticed that the tzatziki sauce had been sitting out uncovered and underneath a hot light for a significant amount of time before finally being covered by the owner i found this to be a bit gross especially since there is dairy in the sauce by the way we learned that the sauce is not homemade but is doctored up by the ownerthe hummus platter came with two warm microwaved pitas the owner noted that he makes his own hummus it was pretty tasty but definitely wasnt a plentiful portionwhat i didnt like about this experience at the park house was that the owner was eating food behind the counter with gloves and seemed to be preoccupied with a woman that was sitting near us i wanted to say something to him about eating with his gloves on but i felt extremely awkwardwell continue to come here but in the future we will pass on the food|came here for the second time since last winter and the feel was completely different it is not in the best part of town firstly there are people in front of it begging for money some people ask you for squares which i found out are cigarettes point being i know  cannot dock the restaurant for that but management can take measures to keep the people from being right in front of their door came here on a tuesday night after a kickball game with my team i talked this place up because the last time i was here the food drink and atmosphere was awesome this time not so much the bar is understaffed those who are seated wait like  minutes to get their drinks as a bar that serves food the bartender came to our table like one time every  minutes because they have  people working herewhere it needed to be at least  anyway it was trivia night when we came here the trivia complementary popcorn and peanuts definitely were an up side that made waiting for drinks and food somewhat better their selection of drinks here is superb which is also a big plus i ordered  orders of falafel without bread after a long period of time  mins i went to the bartender and asked her about my falafel orders she only put in an order for one and gave it to somebody else all i can say was i was disappointed but i have been here when there was a band good service and really fun atmosphere i hope its better next time|well here i am writing a review on a gas station yep and this ones just fine i suppose its a little bigger than the ones near my house which i can never find an empty pump at before sunset it seems at least here when theres a line the wait seems shorter and since this one is right up the street from work its a great and often necessary pit stop before i head out for an enjoyable night in the burgh have to say though i hate the stupid tvs by the gas pumps here i just find them to be aggravating and an unnecessary noisy addition to the areai used to pick up a cookie andor a drink once id managed to brave the rush hour crowd and get my tank of gas the snack and drink selection is pretty reasonable but hey its gas station stuff so its not going to be extraordinary ive never eaten their hot dogs or wrapped sandwiches so i cant comment on those i do kind of wish the lines to the registers werent so slow here i said i used to pick things up here because ive started avoiding coming in just to avoid the slow linesso hey not exceptional but theres nothing here that makes me say risk running on fumes until you find another gas station either its location and its proximity to my work office definitely helps me overlook the cons of the place and hey at the end of the day a sunoco is a sunoco|unfortunately i was not all that impressed with bernies  its a shame its the only real photography store in the city but they could definitley do betteras part of a black and white photography class i needed to pick up film and photo paper among a few other things  while bernies had everything i needed and lots of other supplies i didnt feel all that appreciated for coming in  i spent a couple hundred bucks and felt like i was being shuffled out the door as quickly as possiblei will give the one guy at the counter some credit because a woman right before me asked to get a roll or two of film developed in just barely an hour  i could tell he wanted to get to it quickly but still felt like i was hassling the guy just being therei hate to see real camera stores shut down but unless im in a pinch im probably going to order supplies online from now on|upcharges most of their products that you can find on bh for way less money sales person treated me like i was a very inexperienced not a bad place if youre in need of camera gear without a moments notice but overall definitely order offline|i had a totally mixed experience with bernies which may explain the other reviews i have a dslr that i got from my father  it had never been cleaned or adjusted it had been having some trouble with the battery so i took it to the only place in pittsburgh apparently that will help with this a darkhaired guy greeted me as i walked in and treated me like a total noob and his demeanor made me feel like the dirt under his shoes however he did give me good information and service about my camera when prompted by another man in the shop who i might assume is bernie they told me they could send it to the manufacturer where theyd clean it for a couple hundred bucks but instead they cleaned out the sensors and the lens right there at the counter and checked the contacts between the lens and the camera the darkhaired guy showed me through a magnifying glass what i was looking at and explained that some spots i saw in the viewfinder were inside the top of the camera and wouldnt appear on the pictures the other guy bernie explained to me some of the functions of the camera  i knew these already but it was nice to hear them explained and he showed me a few examples they advised me to get a uv filter to protect my lens which i knew was overpriced but i happily bought anyway to pay for their service so i think the kind of experience you get depends entirely on the person you run into i can see how someone would be put off by the dark haired guy i ran into first and how someone would absolutely love the service from the other guy all in all im pleased with my encounter with this shop but i probably wont buy anything from there considering how overpriced it was  however if something goes wrong or i need any service ill definitely go back|bernies photo center is one of the few locations in pittsburgh youll find that deals with canons dslr compatible equipment its has the appearance of a holeinthewall shop on the outside and the selection of serious photographer lenses and items could be better the layout of the store is rather mismanaged the employee working was friendly and made recommendations allowed me to try out a camera bag and test a lens there were several other customers in the store and he did his best to provide attention to everyone however more employees would have been appropriate to shorten the wait time|decent german food and decent beer  their party room in the basement is great for very large groups birthday parties or other types  i was raised only a few blocks from this place so ive eaten here quite a bit  ive had most of whats on the menu so its hard to decide what is best  very authentic german food and a good neighborhood bar|visiting from san francisco food was mediocre at best bland is the best description  sausages and  weiner schmitzel were unremarkable best was the sweet  sour cabbage that accompanied but also served were overboiled daily vegetable of snap peas asparagus and red peppers to the point that they were losing their color good beer yes it has old photos of days gone by but really there seemed no joy here now|great atmosphere of a neighborhood pub good german beer selection but food was less than mediocre  wont be back weisswurst was very bland  sauerbraten was dry and tasteless  spaetzle was well not tradidional german spaetzle  schnitzel and purple cabbage  were the high points but then again its hard to screw up a fried veal cutlet|greatest place in pittsburgh for german foodmy favorite dinner here is maxs goulash  its a great beef stew with spaetzle and you can get potato pancakes on the side  the potato pancakes are without a doubt the best in pittsburghwhile the food is fantastic the staff and customer service is what keeps this place from being really excellent  its a very come as you are sort of place and rightfully so as its a tavernrestaurant but the staff may take the casual nature of the restaurant a little too seriouslyone evening about a year ago i went in for dinner  i originally thought to sit at a wooden booth in the bar and there was only  open the last towards the back  i sat down and the seat completely collapsed on me  im far from what youd call fat heavy set or even a big girl and the staff just sort of stared at me as though it were my fault that their booth just fell apart the bartender even laughed at me while i tried to get up  no one asked if i was ok no one asked if i needed help and i was generally ignored as i tried to pull myself to my feeti had to approach the hostess tell her that the booth had just collapsed and ask to be reseated  she rolled her eyes at me and told me the dining room was full so id have to wait  ok understandable could you offer a drink or a manager or something while i waited considering the fact that your booth just broke apartthe entire incident was either completely ignored by staff like it never happened or i was looked at like it was my fault  i didnt even get so much as an apologyive been back a couple of times since then because the food is always good but i always sit in the dining room now which is sort of a shame because i actually like the bar atmosphere better  luckily for me though their menu is online and they offer take out  unfortunately they have the hostess answering those phone calls and since shes not a server she doesnt have a lot of knowledge about the menu  when i asked for a total i was put on hold for a couple of minutes  she finally came back and i asked how long and was put on hold again so she could go ask the kitchen  she was quite rude about it like i was bothering herbottom line maxs is the best place for german food in pittsburgh hands down  but the food is the only thing youre going for  the staff could use some help on customer service|after a long day at work i met up with a friend for some german fair on the northside i dont get out to this neck of the woods that often so it was a treat for me all appetizers are   during happy hour so we went with the potato pockets which were perogies in my book they were crispy and creamy and topped with fried onions they also had a side of french onion sour cream pretty tasty stuff plus they gave you so many i could have filled up just on the app i ordered the bells oberon while my dining partner ordered the sampler i have to say that she wasnt that impressed with the brew dirty pipes and i quote i had the same taste from my order so i focused on the foodwe both ended up ordering maxs goulash that was suggested by another yelper you cant go wrong when you have that recommendation this is not our small town neighborhood goulash made from egg noodles and a mix with ground beef the noodles in this feast were homemade and chunky piled high with a peppery meaty sauce infused with fall off the fork beef carrots peas and tiny pearl onions if you remember yesterday was a cold rainy gloomy day this was real comfort and i had to take it to go rain is still in the forecast so leftovers will be grand|i took my boyfriend a germanfood enthusiast to maxs allegheny tavern last night we had been looking forward to a night out together for a while i think the food was good but its hard to say because all i could focus on was the loud  and i mean loud  woman seated behind my boyfriend and meher profanityladen discussion with her dining partners was so bad that for the first time in my life i turned around and asked a fellow restaurant patron to take the volume down a few notches the restaurant was almost empty i have no idea why the host chose to seat a loud party of five next to a couple having a quiet dinner|let me preface this by saying that my understanding of goulash came from what my mom called goulash  goulash in the contrucci household was made of elbow noodles beef and spaghetti sauce  i guess you cant believe everything your parents tell you right  so going in here i was thinking greatmoms goulash  what was set in front me looked nothing like what i was used to  it was a mish mosh of veggiesnoodles gravy and some random unidentifiable food items  i usually eat whatever is put in front of me so i wasnt scared to dive it  sadly i just didnt like it  i thought it was actually not very appetizing at all  i know i know this is like world famous goulash but i was not into it  what i was into was the german potato salad  i love it and honestly i feel like i never get the same version of it anywhere in the burgh  this was a no frills version with scallop sliced potatoes and a thick vinegar sauce  maybe a bit too much but not enough for me to eat it all  would i go back if someone else really wanted to go there but i wouldnt suggest it nor would i go on my own  oh well on to the next one right|i wasnt excited about maxs when i first walked in there were no servers in evidence and i wandered through the entire restaurant looking for an employee to seat me before finally asking the bartender to help after that though things definitely improved i loved the slightly shabby oldworld vibe the old photos on the wall were interesting and the menu slash old newspaper was a pretty cute presentation we got appetizers for dinner and my favorite by miles was the potato pocket with grilled onions on top basically a pierogi so good so so good i actually wasnt as excited about the potato pancakes as i expected  maybe because i was expecting more of a latke style flavor profile not sure we also got the stuffed pretzels  total heart attack on a plate  in a good way i loved that everything we got came with dipping sauces so fun overall a positive experience id go back|the goulash was sickeningly sweet and the bread pudding wasnt sweet at all  but the atmosphere is kind of cool  and the prices are downright cheap|i really thought id never be back  the goulash i had was so so gross  but then  was roped in by some friends who were doing a sunday brunch book club  of course i couldnt miss out on tantalizing conversation so i obliged  i really had no clue what they offered for brunch options but quickly learned they have a a pretty decent size brunch buffet  im not below buffets at all its the fat kid in me  most things still looked a little questionable to me but i went for the big ticket items  make your own omelets potato pancakes and dessert  id hit up the buffet again but still be hasty to check out the regular menu again  the omelet was made right in front of you so i added cheese mushrooms peppers tomatoes and onions  i was super excited about it because it was the size of a football  sadly it was pretty tasteless  i dont think they added any salt or pepper to the egg mix so it came out really bland despite loading up on ingredients  but the potato pancakes i could survive on them forever  they were amazeballs  add some sour cream and i was in potato patch heaven  i had to keep myself from getting more because of the other thing i loaded up on dessert  the desserts looked unassuming but they were also awesome  i had a smattering of delectable bites  the scones were so moist and tasty  i had to stop myself from taking more than   i also had some carrot cake brownies cookies among other things i inhaled and didnt pay attention too  should i be embarrassed  probably  but i dont care because it was darn good|looking for alternative places to brunch we ventured out to maxs the service was quite attentive the brunch offering was reasonable but not overwhelming it consisted mainly of waffles omelette station fried chicken stuffed cabbage potato pancakes sausage bratwurst bacon and a selection of pastriesthe quality of the food was okay but none of the offerings stood out as memorable if you are looking for a reasonably priced brunch you could do worse than maxs but you could also do better|our dinner here was a nice experience  we were going to a concert and when we arrived many people were waiting to be seated  we were told to expect a half hour wait  we sat at the bar and had a drink and in what must have been only ten minutes we were asked if we would mind eating at a booth in the bar area rather than wait for the dinning room  we were thrilled because we were considering eating at the bar  the booth worked out just fine  it wasnt too noisy and  we got served quickly  even though there were several specials that tempted us we both ordered the best thing on the menu  their jger schnitzel with sides of hot german potato salad and sweet and sour cabbage  i had a german black lager and my wife a glass of wine  the basket of assorted rolls comes with delicious apple butter and sauerkraut relish both very tasty  the schnitzel is quite large and we only made it about halfway thru when we asked for a togo box  were looking forward to finishing it here at home  maybe next time well try something differentbut probably notpros inexpensive very tasty schnitzelscons no reservations for parties under |after hearing hofbrauhaushaters say that maxs allegheny tavern is the only place to go in pittsburgh for german food my husband and i decided to finally try the restaurant this afternoonwe were seated in little booths right next to the bar they were cozy but the seats reminded me of old fashioned church pews our waitress soon brought us a little basket of four rolls with butter sauerkraut relish and apple butter though i liked the different varieties of bread it was nothing special the relish and apple butter were a nice touch thoughour waitress was busy with both waiting tables and tending the bar but she managed to check on us pretty frequently our food also came out relatively promptly i order the wiener schnitzel with potato pancakes and spatzle on the side the wiener schnitzel was amazing  by far the best ive ever had the veal was tender and the fried surface was perfectly crispy however the sides sadly did not match this main dish the potato pancakes were oddly bitter and i did not enjoy them with either the sour cream or applesauce i only ate two or three bites and completely stopped eating them i must add that hofbrauhauss potato pancakes are delicious and something that i order every time that i go there i also did not enjoy the spatzle but i am accustomed to eating cheese spatzle so i may be reviewing this harshly since im just not used to plain spatzle but in my opinion it was terribly bland and wateryoverall maxs allegheny tavern served one incredible item wiener schnitzel but everything else was merely mediocre because of this i really dont plan on returning to the restaurant again any time soon ill be sticking with the fun environment and overall good food at hofbrauhaus actually|the food isnt as good as it once was  the atmosphere is kind of dark and needs to be updated  we ordered potato pancakes that had to be returned because they somehow tasted fishy i dont even want to speculate  the other items we ordered were ok staff is great very friendly and attentive|not sure why my review was flagged but i can assure that im not an employee or another restaurant making trouble for a competitor just an average consumer that lives on the northside          when will i ever learn i really want to like this place its a cool building with neat old fashion feel to it but the food is mediocre at bestthe last time i was there i got what they called german goulash i have had this made for me by real german cooks so i have a good idea what its supposed to taste like and this isnt it it was made from pork instead of beef with frozen peas and carrots the gravy wasnt a rich and savory it was canned or packaged with i dont even know what spices in it when i complained to the waitress she said that most people dont like it either she asked me if i wanted something else but i was in a hurry and ate the meat after i scraped the gravy off of it i have been to this place  or  times a year and i have had undercooked potato pancakes greasy rubins and cold sausages the only thing i can say is really good is the spinach salad with warm bacon dressing it is a bit over priced for the size but it is always really goodsunday bruncha neighbor talked me into going here for the brunch and i was glad she did for an all you can eat brunch they do a nice job keeping things stocked and fresh the omelet chef was very good making stuff just as you asked him for yum the sausage is great and the bacon is cooked in a range of doneness that everyone can find so for dinner and lunch my original  stars stand but the sunday brunch is a solid   stars|fyi new happy hour specials are awful just awful sorry guys as much as i love you   ive got to put my food down somewhere even raising the prices on all of the apps to  wouldve been better than taking the pierogie aka potato pockets special off all together wont be back|this is americanized german food  for real german food go to hofbrauhaus and ask for a schnitzel|ive been here once because this was an easy place to meet for dinner with a friend i enjoyed eating here well enoughim honestly not a diehard fan of german food although i guess that wouldnt have mattered a peak at the menu beforehand revealed that this places menu is mostly americanized  proof of this is the fact that my salad was topped with french fries only in pittsburgh trust me even if you dont really like german food therell at least be a sandwich youll like herethinking about my usual overall summary i have to say this place wasnt bad and served as a reasonable place to meet  the beer menu looked nice from what i saw and the atmosphere was pretty cozy and even nostalgic and homely  but man the dining options really werent that extraordinary im still torn as to how to feel about its menu because on the one hand obviously it being americanized meant even i could find something to enjoy but on the other i feel bad for the people who do like german food and may not be getting what they hope for it wasnt bad enough that id say dont try it and see  just understand it may not be exactly what you expect|i went to maxs for the first time with my family a few weeks ago i ordered the kielbasa sandwich with a side of kase spaetzle the kielbasa on the sandwich was topped with a serving of sauerkraut and served on a toasted roll  it was your average kielbasa sandwich satisfying but nothing out of the ordinarythe kase spaetzle however was noteworthy and delicious it was smothered in gouda cheese sauce and i love me some gouda i ate it all and i would have licked the plate if it were socially acceptable as for the environment the restaurant is housed in what looks like what might of used to be a house back in the day it had lots of little dining rooms the decor was kind of outdated but i think thats what youd expect and its part of the charm the tables were spaced a little too close for my liking but it was tolerable overall id go back if invited but i dont know if id go again on my own|i have stopped going to maxs for regular meals because the food isnt so good but a friend likes to go for sunday brunchi find a good portion of the food is acceptable for the brunchexcept the food is not kept hot or even warm on the buffet cold kielbasi and sauerkraut is a turn off even though it would be great if it was warmer  the chef that makes the eggs and omelets to order is really good and the sausage is the best the bacon and the chicken needs to be cooked a little longer as they are always half rawso much of what they have would be good if it was kept at least warm since they have it in chaffing dishes ive found that the food comes out cold from the kitchen makes you wonder just how safe the kitchen is|brunch brunch brunch  maxs serves an awesome sunday brunch buffet  the omelet station is standard no egg whites for you healthnuts and heavenly pastries will always await you along with potato pancakes  im not in love with their potato pancakes but being that maxs specializes in german food youve got to try at least one with their homemade applesaucesome of my rotating favorites on the buffet include red cabbage eggs benedict and the farmers breakfast  you can order off the menu during brunch if you arent in mood to gorge yourself on the buffet  no drinks included with the buffet  but you can order them of coursei love the decor at maxs  its an old house and much of the furniture looks like it was in this house and just remained when it converted to a restaurant  maxs location in old deutschtown on the north side fits it perfectly  they even offer a shuttle to heinz field on steeler game days small fee applies|very good old school german american food nothing innovative here was here on a saturday night and the placed was packed really loved the cheddar cheese stuffed deep fried pretzels and the potato pancakes|this is one of the only german restaurants i know of in the area the meal was good and reasonably priced they also have a good beer selection on draft and in bottles we had a party of  going for a  dinner on a thursday bigger parties tend to chat a little more and take longer in my experience i felt like they were sort of rushing us out that might be because they closed the dining room door and started vacuuming the front bar room while we were still finishing up our dinner im not sure if anyone was eating out there but im very happy we werent because it seems really gross to me to vacuum around food this was around  and im pretty sure they serve until  besides that our service was good and so was the food we all split the stuffed pretzels and potato skins as an appetizer the pretzels are delicious i could have eaten them all myself deepfried and stuffed with cheese yummy i ordered the chicken viennese and was pleased with my meal it came with a choice of two sides and i went with a delicious sweet potato casserole and my favorite thing of the night potato pancakes i prefer sour cream but you can also get applesauce yum yum yum get lots of potato pancakes the chicken was delicious and was served over spaetzel which was just ok ive had the kase spaetzel there before which is served in a cheese sauce and much better than the regular there was a variety of entrees ordered from sausage platters to wiener schnitzel and everyone seemed pleased with their meals you get a lot for your money and ill never turn down a chance to eat potato pancakes|this used to be the best german food in town i have seen a gradual decline in the food over the past several years the gravies have changed and the maxs goulash one of my favorite dishes has a different sauce strangely dessert sweet and change in the protein the sides are still great but the food used to be so much better|maxs was good but ive had betterthe restaurant is located in a tired part of town it isnt in a bad area but im not sure how i would feel eating there after dark when you walk in you walk through the tavern portion of the restaurant which is dark and gloomy we were escorted to the rear of the tavern which is covered in bw pictures from the s which gives it a old world tired feelingthe menu choices were standard faire for a true german restaurant i had maxs goulash which said it came with spaetzle but it is piled in the bottom of the bowl and not on the side which was okay the goulash was too vinegary for my tastes but it was okaymy wifes jaeger schnitzel was good but ive had better at das wald cafe httpwwwyelpcombizdaswaldcafenewportnews|visited maxs last friday night with friends whod come in from out of town as another reviewer described the whole experience was tired service was very good however i was hoping for a more colorful fresh decor but everything looks aged and washed out i just got a very blah vibe as we walked back to our table and it really had a bad impact on my appetite and perception i had the wurst sampler platter and it was okay the potato pancakes were dulli dont think there was any salt in them the cheesestuffed pretzels were very goodthe following day was the nd annual deutschtown music festival the neighborhood is working toward revitalization and i hope local businesses like maxs will step up their game i believe the investment will be worth it|i cant believe maxs is going from  stars to  stars for me  understand i loved this place  over the years we have had so many family dinners here including my sisters rehearsal dinner that its almost become like eating at a relatives housebut now that relative has gone senile and needs to go to a nursing home and they cant cook anymorefor the past two years every time we come here we say this just isnt as good as i remember  for starters the food is always served cold  dont believe me  i hope you enjoy tepid knackwurst and cold mashed potatoesbtw to whoever makes their mashed potatoes you have to boil the potatoes before you mash them  yesterday they were undercooked gritty and grossin fact all of the food is becoming gross  my friend got the roasted beef and what came out looked like a cold cut covered with a congealed beef gravy that had bits of carrots in it  wtf was thatim done  this place has gone down hill  you need a new chef immediately  maxs is a north side institution but there are so many new better restaurants opening up that they really need to up their gamepsthanks for the nausea and hurling about  hours after dinner|the old arcade game was excellent and only a few quarters to playdrinks nice enough bartenders were really nice nice enough place|beware of the ketchup  my family has always loved maxs weve been going there since i was a child and my sister even had her rehearsal dinner there  so imagine my dismay when we tried brunch there today and they gave me a botulismfilled bottle of ketchup that exploded black crud all over my shirt  then they didnt even do anything to make it up to me  the brunch was also very substandard everything was cold  not even the potato pancakes tasted good  ive had better meals at the complimentary continental buffet at the holiday inn  but perhaps part of the meal was also tainted by the fact that i couldnt get the thought of their negligence for food contamination out of my head  who knows how long that sour cream had been sitting out  im really disappointed i had really enjoyed going to maxs up to this point  dont think well be back|a good selection of classic pittsburgh beers and tasty german cuisine the service is pretty good and its a great place to watch a pirates game|frequent visitor the place is definitely starting to slip food wise had a turkey rueben that had about  slice of turkey on it and not much elsefries are always soggy these days ill stick with the happy hour with half price apps daughter had the schnitzel which she said was very greasy which shouldnt be the norm my water glass had onion pieces in the bottom of it server was good though  thank god for the staff |cozy down to earth atmosphere cute to see familes of three generations sitting together for a friday night meal the food itself was ok but just a tad bit pricey i thought my bavarianstyle pretzels were a bit too heavy since they were deepfried and my friends schnitzel platter with spatzle was a bit low on salt not a bad experience overall but i might still rather go to penn brewery or hofbrau next time|came here with a large group of friends for dinner they were great about the reservation we made for  and had a nice table in its own little room waiting for us when we arrived i had the hefeweizen style beer which was good but had a strange taste and aftertaste to it but it wasnt so bad as i ordered a second one for apps we had the  bavarian nachos not great by any means and actually very oddand cold the stuffed fried pretzel and the red cabbage with sausages the red cabbage here is amazing and the pretzel was fairly good with a honey mustard dipping saucebut i guess its kind of hard to mess up something thrown into a deep fryer and stuffed with cheese for our entrees i had their famous potato pancake reuben with sides of red cabbage couldnt get enough and their house german potato salad  also very tasty fiance had potato pancakes spatzel with cheese sauce and sausages the spatzel was not in as a creamy a cheese sauce as i would have hoped  it was a bit oliy not so much creamy we were both a little underwhelmed sans the cabbage with the entire meal i hate to say it  but i have had better authentic german style food at church potlucks and even hofbrahaus in a comparison to the beers at hofbrahaus  these did just not stack up for me i would give mat another go round to try some of their other offerings  their schnitzels looked pretty good|got take out from this place on the weekend  ordered kung pao chicken steamed dumplings and pork egg rolls  i was really hungry so it hit the spot but there wasnt that many chicken pieces in my kung pao chicken  a lot of peanuts as expected and a whole lot of celery and carrots aka filler  so i was a bit disappointed in that  the steam dumplings were good especially when fresh and hot  the egg roll was tasty as well  i didnt find it too oily  very affordable and a generous portion  i had the leftovers the next day|i work on the north side and went for a walk to find something new for lunch  i am quickly growing tired of eco bistro directly downstairs from my office at allegheny centerat any rate came across this place at the corner of ohio and the onramp to   the lunch special was inexpensive and grabbed a soda for about  in all  i had the kung pao chicken and it was prepared to order  tasty cheap fast  i ate inside  there are only a handful of tables in this place and its decently clean|what a great price  for a  inch hoagie no shortage of beef on this sandwich   here in the burg you can get steak hoagies just about anywhere   this is one of my favorite staple hoagies  this may not have been the best but it was up there  nice solid sandwich  the bread was fresh too    thank you north shore deli |the hotel itself is really beautiful the room was large i believe we had a king bed there did seem to be mold on the ceiling which we told them about just giving them a heads up and they said it was something else okay water damage and then black stuff around it not mold  the neighborhood is kinda sketch i dont think it is worth the  and some dollars we paid for a night ouch the location is pretty nice not too far from much about a  min drive to downtown|this is a nice historic euro style hotel in the middle of the city an old catholic church converted into a hotel the rooms are small but well appointed a very small bar opened only from  pm to pm the breakfast buffet was acceptable very near several eateries and pubs but im not sure its a safe neighborhood to wandering around in they do offer free shuttle service to and from restaurants and the convention center some of the staf were friendly some were surly|i was very specific when i made my reservations several months ago i needed a nonentrance level room away from noise we were given a room right off of the hotel foyer it is midnight and a party rages just outside my door even though i have called the front desk asking for their assistance right now i would prefer to be in a motel  this room was relatively not cheap it should have at least been cutrate given out only as a last resort  the next time i am in pittsburgh it will not include a stay at the priory which is a shame because besides this issue it is a nice place but if you are considering staying at this hotel why take the chance while the party continues and i am getting no help from the front desk i am tempted to lower my rating to a single star but hey i can always catch up on my sleep tomorrow night|ended up here since for some reason all the major hotels on the north side were booked  overall this is a solid option if that happens to you but probably wouldnt make a point to stay here otherwisenice staff fairly easy walk to north side or across the bridges but as others have mentioned its not in a great area  literally on the wrong side of the tracks  i live in a similar area in philly so it didnt bother me as much but can see this being an issue for others  i also walked the whole time and didnt use the shuttle so thats an option as well but did hear others waiting a while to that just to go to pnc park which i simply walked to myself in  minutesits definitely an old place so you could see that as charm or simply as old  again not a bad place at all but nowhere id miss if i stayed elsewhere|this is a beautiful hotel inside of an old church i was really impressed with the outdoor space the tiny bar and the expansive dining room while it was within walking distance to the stadiums and the andy warhol museum the neighborhood  was sketchy it appeared to be up and comingperhaps a return trip is in order it was a good value for the price|booked through a third party site and they tried to stick us in a queen room even though they had plenty of kings available definitely gave attitude about it but upgraded anyway he wanted to charge me the difference but i refused just bad service overall no one to help with bags morning or night even the day front desk person was short with us and rude i couldnt wait to get out of there the room was clean and charming the area is definitely rough i wouldnt stay here again|inside the old st marys priory a beautiful hotel transformed from a real monastery is monks bar the tiny and i mean very small bar with three tiny tables and three bar stools is big on properly made drinks i sat at a stool which isnt high enough for the bar which made for a rather uncomfortable seating my friend katrina has known the lone bartender nikki for years and has been wanting to get me out of my comfort zone and try new places i beat katrina to the priory and found a lot of free parking out front after  pm street parking is free and went inside now situated i sat down and looked over the menu and decided on a monktini citron absolute fresh lime juice and razzmatazz perfect for a warm summer night not heavy or filling a little sweet a little tart refreshing after katrina arrived another couple walked in and sat at one of the small cafe tables the tiny room induces conversation with others especially when the bartender introduces you to everyone time for a bite and this is where monks bar lost a star the uncomfortably high bar and low stools cost them a star as well but as a practicing vegan there were no options i could enjoy sandwiches are served on pretzel buns monks invented pretzels with options like a ham and turkey club turkey creamy chicken salad and a few others i forgot i did order hummus but it wasnt filling at all i did enjoy the house made lemoncello although i have made this in the past monks makes theres with grain alcohol which i found to be too strong ill continue to make mine with  proof vodka and forgo the impending hiccups it was a very interesting night made new friends found an interesting new spot and a really cool building id love to explore more of everyone should try monks bar and get out of your comfort zone|hmmmwhat to say about key west  i wouldnt exactly call it warm  get it  hahaha  a friend and i checked this place out on a friday night  you know that point in the night when you think to yourself i could go home right now and call it a night or i could do this right and see where the night leads me  well we decided on the latter and it led us to key westit is a total dive of a bar  its fairly small inside and no one seemed to pay us any attention  key west seems like the type of bar where you get regulars and so if youve never been there before youre probably going to stick out  but no one really bothered us and we just hung out for a bit  there seemed to be a potential fight breaking out behind us and like i said its not that big so it caused a bit of a scene in the bar  it quickly died down and started back up and then tapered back down  fyi this seems like a normal occurrence as my friend and i were the only ones that were alarmed    another thing to keep in mind beside the potential fights is that its cash only|i went here for lunch and got the grilled cajun chicken sandwich and salad both of which were fine  the service was really good  overall not a bad place but nothing spectacular|my review is limited to the restroom  i was in town for a steelersjets game and the portable toilet line was very long  so i walked over here and for  the allowed me to use the restroom for the rest of the day they stamped my hand  i was told that it would be donated to a charity i believe he said als  great idea if it is true  the restroom is not very large mens room had  urinals and  toilets but it is much better than the options out in the parking lot  as far as the rest of the place it was packed with fans prior to game time  lots of food drinks and tv  might be a better hang out spot if the weather is crummy but i prefer to tailgate  itd be a good spot to watch the game if you did not have a ticket and tailgated with your friends|so apparently i have this habit at least last week of visiting a barrestaurant during its most dead time in this case it was somewhat understandable for clark bar  grill because it was a very uneventful sports week regardless i wanted to check out this place housed in the old manufacturing warehouse of the historic clark bar candy co rip just north of pnc parki wasnt overly impressed with either the menu or beer selections in fact there were only five beers on tap and one had just kicked i ordered the special a reuben sandwich with tater tots which were both decent i washed it down with a penn pilsner local brew and then left to go check out another place on the north sidethis may be a good spot to hit up beforeafter a pirates or steelers game because of its proximity to both stadiums but im not sure id venture back otherwise|total dive  umm  a gang fight started breaking out and one of the guys had tear drops tatted on his face  isnt that code for murder  the bartender shouted to break the fight up not exactly in those words but yahhh  we left soon after  enter here at your own riskalthough i will say i may have stuck out like a sore thumb here but no one bugged  i have a feeling ill never go back  makes for a good story  stars for that|first i would like to say the pasta too of old had good food this was just average  the italian and mushroom steak hoagies werent that great  the steak was so chopped that it kept falling out of the bun  the pizza wasnt that good either  the prices are higher than the food was good  for  italian and  for  mushroom steak so not worth it but i guess they figure they can get from the people who work at the hospital and with all the new housing going up  i will not get anything from there again|ah mullins no not mullens which is something i always have to clarify when someone asks if i want to meet them for lunch at one of these places while im at work this isnt the bar and grill located near pnc park its a little diner that stands alone on a corner as you drive past the warhol and continue towards the david mccullough bridge its easy to miss or just drive on by which is kind of a shame because this is a pretty nice spot to eat i think it can admittedly be a little offputting to walk in if youre not expecting their seating arrangement which consists of a mix of booths regular tables and foldup tables along with chairs that youre more likely to find in a school than a diner but food wise this is definitely the place to go for cheap greasy diner eats they make breakfast as well as lunch and i have to say their breakfasts look pretty good three egg omelets with a side dish holy crap ive mostly ordered their sandwiches and burgers and thought they were pretty good overall as long as you come in expecting diner food and nothing else i think youll like what you finda note  this place charges a fee for using a creditdebit card when you spend under  and their food is so cheap that you can spend less than  very easily so bring cash|we didnt order directly from them so im not ranking any lower than three starshowever our wedding catering sourced their bread from breadworks and it was quite unimpressive  in fact many of our guests identified it as the one thing they would have changed about our mealnot sure if it was because our reception was on a saturday and maybe the hotel only takes deliveries on weekdays or something but it just wasnt freshtasting and certainly wasnt onpar with say mancinis|im still a fan but something is starting to change here and not for the better the last two times ive bought from here ive been a little disappointed i got some hoagy rolls that were dense and tasted flat ive had better from sams club today i stopped and asked for some rustic italian and what i got was a regular italian loaf and it was only soso it was only slightly better than any other place that bakes its own italian like shop n save maybe the store clerk gave me the wrong bread and i hope so because i have loved this place for years and i hope they arent just making for the restaurant trade now|inconsistent again the last  hoagies ive gotten here is again only mediocre the meat doesnt have much flavor and the hoagie sauce tastes like a little olive oil with nothing else again very plain  the bread is the best part which is really sad  i still like their buffalo pizza better than franks but who knows what its going to be like if quality is slipping  i guess i will have to go to the deli and pick up the stuff for a homemade hoagie when i feel like having one for  bucks i think i can make a pretty good hoagie for myself and family|i ordered lunch from rons pizza palace after a staff member of theirs visited my works building to promote rons to nearby businesses the staff member gave us all a menu and mentioned a discount we could use for the day so my coworkers and i figured wed give them a try andi was pretty underwhelmed for starters a couple people definitely had problems ordering due to a poor connection or something like that fine it happens but then when our food eventually arrived the poor deliveryman told me that he had no idea how much my lunch cost fortunately id gotten that info when i ordered but what in the world did he plan on doing if i hadnt calculated my payment in advance would i have had to call in to sort out their staffs mistake would i have just handed the guy a random amount of money and waved him off i have no ideaand the food itself certainly left a lot to be desired i had ordered mozzarella sticks as an appetizer but they did not impress me the cheese was anything but gooey and i ended up eating a couple sticks in one bite because the cheese simply wouldnt rip apart when i bit into it the batter on the sticks also left a pretty bad aftertaste in my mouth so much so that i chugged coke after every bite to try to make up for it as for the sandwiches my coworkers complained that their hoagies all came with too much mayo  one girl had even asked for her mayo to come on the side no such luck it came on her sandwich just like everyone else as for me the ranch i had asked to go with my buffalo chicken hoagie didnt even arrive i used some from the company fridge and the ranch was the only way i could eat the sandwich which was drowning in buffalo sauce and could have been taken out of their toaster a lot sooner  entire sections of my sandwichs bread shouldnt break off when i bite into it but thats what happens when you over toast something so badlyand is what happened herei currently dont plan on ordering from this place again this is a prime example of you get what you pay for  and personally id prefer to spend a couple extra dollars for a tastier and more satisfying lunch|if this place wasnt up on a hill it might be a hipster paradise as it stands it is a beloved and wellattended local bar with frequent karaoke nights ive been there twice and so far the bartender has been the same wonderful slightly hurried lady who remembered us the second time around and who was willing to help me experiment by making a manly cocktail with a raw egg shaken into it i guess it helps that the other half of billys bar is billys restaurant with eggs to spare a good time is always had belting out the classics with friendly faces and free popcorn abounding  be forewarned if you start coming every week some of the classics will become even more classic as you start to realize your new friends have favourite songs to jive to on a regular basis|okay im biased because im actually german and in germany id probably never set a foot into a traditionally designed beer house  just because im from berlin and this is more stuff bavarians would dobut i was in pittsburgh so different rules came here for brunch on a sunday because of an invite youre not a member sorry no entry luckily my accent gave it away and apparently germans are always welcomethey serve proper bavarian food  wurst bacon  red cabbage fried potatoes  pretty solid you can also get omelettes together with a krug of german beer is that what we germans do for breakfast back home maybe in the bavarian woods im not sure but it is definitely somethingthe interior is quite unique  imagine oktoberfest in  and you get the idea fun fact not everyone in there speaks german and they have waitresses that work there for over a decade i do however appreciate that this pittsburgh institution is around for more than  years and hope theyll stick around for a whilemaybe in another  years even the neighborhood wont look as dodgy as it looks right now|this place was a total surprise to me i didnt really know anything existed on troy hill aside from penn brewery until i went for a ride through the area this past weekend while passing through i noticed billys it was open the steeler game was about to start why not check it outthe interior is dated but clean and has some character you enter though the bar and the dining room is on your right this being a sunday afternoon though the dining room was not open no biggie ill saddle up to the bar which seats about  people the bartender was very nice introduced herself and wanted to get to know me this seems like a mostly locals only bar but they are very happy when people from outside the neighborhood stop in one thing i heard several times while i was in there was troy hill is getting better more people should come here and find outi tried the soup of the day chicken and corn chowder and an order of their wings  during the steelers games both were very good and made me want to come back to try more of the menu the beer selection is a bit limited they mostly stick with the big name domestics but that being said the beer is pretty darn cheap sam adams octoberfest was  a glass or  a pitcher ill certainly be back to billys and i think you should go too turns out there are things on troy hill|i visited both the art and natural history museums last weekend i majorly bummed that the large dinosaur exhibit was under refurbishment most of the rest of the museum is a large taxidermy exhibit  not my thingin addition the art museum although nice did not live up to the major impressionist collection rep it has maybe im just spoiled with philly museums but this one was a bit of a disappointment major thumbs down to the museum for not notifying visitors ahead of time that the statue room was shut down for a private function during the day|first off you have to pay although you do get two museums out of this for only  so youve payed and you go in and look around and the first room you come to seems amazing ancient statuary tombs the elgin marbles wait the elgin marbles you seem to recall that those are in london isnt there an ongoing controversy about repatriating them to greeceoh wow oh ok theyre all plaster casts thats sort of cool i guess maybe im a bit slow on the uptake so move along the contemporary art works are pretty fantastic particularly a rachel whiteread piece a video installation filmed supposedly in a semitrailer and a sculpture using mirrors also there is some great pgh related art especially the painting of the dog from the firebrigadego over to the natural history museum appreciate the fact that the displays were constructed before people worried about portrayals of violence and proceed to play a pretty fun game of spotthedeadthinginthediorama and trust me nearly every diorama includes a death go into the wood paneled room yep and walk into an area that is tucked away and looks like an afterthought to see a badger its a pretty great badger as far as they gonotice that much of the museum is under construction wander out after an hour or two maybe when the dinosaur exhibit is up it will be worth going apparently the bone collection if extensive in any case leave a little disappointed|the pros dinosaurs in their time is pretty cool  the years of renovation were worth it  the former dinosaur hall is completely transformed  remember how everything was in straight lines and the dinosaurs were up on their big pedestals  now the exhibit is sort of sshaped the walls are painted with colorful murals the support columns are disguised as trees there are plants around the dinosaurs and dead leaves underneath  underneath every dinosaur is a nameplate with a lot of information and a touchscreen with even more information including a section on how the carnegie museum researchers contributed to the discovery or naming of this dinosaur  there is a lot more natural light than i remember and there are  balconies that overlook the exhibits for more photo opportunities  there is also an extensive timeline of the carnegie museums expeditions and contributions to paleontology and a timelapse video of the renovationsthe cons the rest of the history museum is pretty lame compared to this new and awesome exhibit  the biggest examples are the nd floor halls of african and north american wildlife and the rd floor birds hall  big cases of taxidermy in a woodpaneled room with dim lighting  hardly thrilling  the rd floor polar world is starting to look dated too  even the fonts used date the exhibitsadmission is now  for adults  for students free for pitt students  this does get you into the carnegie museum of art also but im usually tired after doing the whole history museum so i never get over to the art side  i would recommend seeing the dinosaurs then skipping the rest of the history museum if youve been there before  the dinosaurs in their time would get five stars on its own but the rest of the museum is lagging behind unfortunately|pittsburgh is viewed by many as a rd rate city  it is most certainly not the carnegie museums and surrounding area alone prove what a great city pittsburgh really is ive only visited this museum once and i hate it when yelpers have one bad outing as their only experience and give a  star rating grow up peoplethat being said  theres plenty negative things to say about this place lots of wasted space i was astounded by the large area and time i spent wasted on replicas its great for the children to see dont get me wrong but ok heres some more fake stuff from a long time ago from the other side of the world and the fake jemstonesi just dont get why i would go to a museum to look at what basically amounts to counterfeits also the day i was there was very empty dead in most every area that is normally a blessing but at this place it gives the nazi security staff members your personal undivided attention they have a rule here that your backpack only be carried on one shoulder and if you are wearing it properly on both shoulders they yell at you i had  women who after asked  or  times followed me around from room to room and stared at me waiting for me to move a strap off my armor course being an immature manchild i gave her what she wanted that backpack looks too heavy for you come down with me and check it in a locker yeah right ladyit was baffling to me why they would insist on this as a huge deal so i asked someone in charge later while i was being ruleabiding one shoulder museum goer and she explained that people that wear their backpacks correctly forget that theyre wearing them and turn around abruptly and knock over things or people oops i forgot that im wearing this on my back and have now knocked over this fake inexpensive museum piece i asked her if she realized its not good for the bags or your back to wear them incorrectly and she said the museum is more important than those things then  with my pack on one shoulder  i said ohok then whipped my backpack around and hit her on the side because i forgot it was there immature manchildugh but it is a very nice place beautiful on the outside and many cool paintings and scultpures quite resonable entrance fee great location they let you take photographs inside it seems like it would be great for children|tasty traditional not trendy and tempermental greens  beans rock dining here is as if your best friend invited you to tag along to sunday dinner at his chef uncle ninos place byob of chianti to pair with the solid unpretentious food in a modest setting with a nostagic waitstaff long before the open kitchen concept became a hot topic this cooks line has turned out many a quality  plate over the years|i feel like im being generous with my star allocation  but i also feel that i need to be a bit forgiving since ive been sick the past few days and my tastebuds are a bit off  that being said the friends i was with also didnt seem overly impressed by the food so i think im being generous and the rating should be more like i ordered the spinach ravioli and they were just ok  there was way too much sauce and i guess i anticipated it to taste a bit more basily or something  it did say basil cream sauce but what i got just seemed like a whole lotta tomato vodka sauce  the spinach and ricotta didnt have much flavor but perhaps that was due to my diminished lack of taste these few days with being sick  all i could taste was the tomato sauce and that to me does not make a great or particularly good meal  oh and to top it off the person corkage fee is outrageous|food menu will appeal to vegetarians and nonvegetarians with daily dinner specials separate lunch sandwiches and dinner entrees menus both soups were vegetarian according to the waitress never heard of vegetarian minestrone before i ordered penne with multiple veggies and a white wine sauce it was above average but not great soup was good a bowl of bread sticks was on the table and replaced regularly salad was average size and qualityprice dinners range from  with most toward the higher end of that range not expensive but the quality of the food probably deserves the lower end of that scaledrinks byobatmosphere sports barfamily restaurant type setting with pictures of athletes all over the wall but better than sports bar quality food and serviceservice waitress refilled water many times was on the ball and timely answered all questions about the menu good service reasonable prices good but not great food nothing wrong with legends but also nothing spectacularwould i go back again i wouldnt drive to the north side to eat here but if i was in the north side it would be at the top of the list particularly if friendsfamily were at agh directly across the street|sowhat do you say when a highly rated place lets you down  it was okaywhen a meal rocks my world i usually want to lick the bowl clean yes like a dog  i did not sadly feel that way about this place  it is byob but the catch is its  per glass  yep thats right not per table my friend  keep that in mindi got the greens and beans on recommendation from many yelpers on here  maybe i just dont have the taste for it but i thought it was weird watery andnot good  i also thought it was going to be green beans and it was kidney beans and spinach that tasted like a warm caesar salad  no thanksi ordered the penne vodka which is my fav meal to order at italian restaurants  i also like to add a meatball on if its homemade  it was in fact confirmed to be homemade so i was all over it  the meatball itself was delicious  i love a bready meatball  you know the type  soft and packed with flavor  it was the winner of the night  the vodka sauce was good but i wanted way more  now i have to preface this by saying im a total sauceaholic  i love me a good amount of sauce this didnt even come close  then i looked over at serena rs plate and her ravioli which i thought was the same was swimming in it  so i stole some of herswould i come back  if someone really wanted to  but i have a hunch theres way better italian places to dine at in the burghso now im on the hunt  i gotta connect with my roots ya know|yay i finally got to try legends north shore after having the place booked mark for a few months now and so can cross this place off my list after walking in legends north star is small but homey which was nice the place was not filled so we had our pick of tables our waitresses were sweet and did not kick us out after we remained at our table to finish wine  minutes after closing legends north shore provides bread to munch on crunchy airy pieces that dont fill you up entirely before the entree which i so often do and they provide a bottle with seasoned olive oil which was kind of oily on the outside i tried the tuesday  cent green and beans special along with a salad and spaghetti and meatballs i wasnt sure what the green and beans were but they were cheesy and salty but very watery i thought they were tasty but confused if what i ate were indeed what greens and beans were suppose to be the salad was fresh but nothing special and i felt the same for the spaghetti and meatballs made in house from the meatball to the pasta i feel that when you go to an italian restaurant you can judge how well they cook based on classic dishes i couldnt stop eating the spaghetti and meatballs though i felt full half way through i thought the meal was overall good though not anything spectacular and pricey for what it was    for spaghetti and meatballs and  for the greens and beans plus some tax maybe if they knocked a few bucks off to  or  or so it would be more reasonable imho also points are deducted for the corkage fee of  per person not per bottle we were not aware so they basically made an easy  bucks from the four of us at dinner|small overcrowded unfriendly staffthe food is okay  typical italian fair that could be better seasoned there are much better options nearby but in a pinch its decent|this is a really small restaurant and is byob the servers are friendly and the food was good i ordered two appetizers small plates which were very good  greens and beans and then muscles the flavours were both good but the muscles were served with multiple closed shells which for the small portion was a negative i dont have much to say about this experienceit was just aok|legends is losing a star for being closed for lunch on saturdays who does that|ok so based off the recommendation of my date i thought  that i would like legends north shore but i left dinner disappointed and in need of a mint to mask the over abundance of garlic salt that i had consumedthis restaurant is in a prime location on the north side and has plenty of opportunity to capitalize on the growth in the area that said allow me to jump into some of the minusesbeans and greens appetizer  i love beans and greens but was shocked by the amount of garlic the chef added actually i dont think it was garlici believe it was garlic salt a huge nono dont get me wrong i love garlic but there was so much that it killed a simple rustic dishblackened shrimp pasta  my date and i shared this dish this dish tasted as though an entire container of garlic salt had accidentally been dropped onto the plate before being served the shrimp and pasta however were cooked well had the chef backed off the garlic he would have presented a more edible dinner i was not in the mood to send this dish back to the kitchen but did call this out to the waitress once our meal concludedthe restaurant is cute in a great location and service is friendly and prompt these are all important things to me but quality and taste takes precedence  unfortunately legends just didnt do it for mewould i go back most likely not there are far too many other italian restaurants in pittsburgh that i would like to give a try|its okay but it was just ok  theres a  per person corking fee which caught us off guard  we were expecting that would be for the tablewe started with the polenta and the mozzarella  the mozzarella was unremarkable deep friend mozzarella in breading  of course it was good it is fried cheese  but it was nothing special  the polenta was a real stand out tasted home made and was deliciousthey give you garlic olive oil and garlic bread sticks to dip in the oil  this was free so im not complaining but that just seemed a heavy and oily combo to me  also the breadsticks were covered in rosemary and i loathe rosemarymy friend had the special pan seared shrip over pesto penne and she loved it  i had this chicken dish with apricots and it was  alright  it was good but i felt like the searing on the chicken could have made this dish excellentoverall i would come here again but maybe id stick with a staple like chicken parmigana|legends is goodbut not special its just your typical italianamerican restaurant but with a shorter menu than most huge portions of pasta as expected started with mussels diablo which were good but we had a lot of closed shells i had the penne alla vodka and the sauce was good especially with fresh basil leaves the pasta was a bit overcooked basically if youre italian you know how to make this food at home that doesnt make it bad just aokthe party next to us brought a bottle of grape pucker vodka and tonic water as their byob hey whatever works|legends of the north shore on the top  restaurants in pittsburgh list i would have to disagree i joined a three dining companions for dinner on a recent friday night when i walked in i was shocked by how incredibly tiny it is inside we were crammed at a table next to a large party our server was very matter of fact and to the point what i would expect eating at a dinner not a nice italian restaurant i decided to order the penne vodka with prosciutto and the wedding soup the soup was nothing memorable i enjoyed the crisp bread foccacia and oil better when the entrees arrived i was surprised that my penne vodka was garnished with prosciutto i assumed from the menu that there would be more proscuitto than a thin two inch slice on top of the dish overall the sauce was very good not too creamy not to tomatoey however i enjoyed my husbands gnocchi bolognese much more the gnocchi was tender and the sauce was flavorful and meaty all in all i doubt i will be heading back to legends with so many great restaurants in pittsburgh legends doesnt make my list|stopped by for lunch and was greeted by greatlooking focaccia coming out of the oven based on that view i decided to have the eggplant foccacia it came with homemade italian wedding soup which was good with fresh veggies  it also came with delicious bread and seasoned oil for dipping excellent  the eggplant was good but honestly the sun dried tomato and olive tapenade did not enhance the sandwich it would have rocked with a homemade marinara instead  the waitress was friendly in a casual way and the atmosphere was warm and contemporary  i will try something else next time as it is worth a return visit|this was my boyfriends choice for his birthday dinner we had both heard great things plus we love byob spots ill start with saying that the service was great our waitress made us feel like regulars that have been frequenting the restaurant for years we both ordered specials they were different preparations of fish both were really good everything we tasted was wonderful the downfall was when we got the check the specials were both  they were good  but not that good you can find great italian food elsewhere and skip the  tab|we have been wanting to try legends of the north shore for a long time and since we were right across the street yesterday we seized the lunch opportunity it was not what i expected at all tiny i expected because id seen it driving by many times dineresque inside completely unexpected i knew they are byob but after eating lunch here i cant imagine any scenario where id take more than a couple of beers with me not a place to linger over a bottle of wine tables on top of each other cramped and kind of a low end divey diner uh uhi wanted the mussels for lunch but was told they were out of them not terribly disappointed because our server had just run through the lunch specials and one had caught my attention enough that i mentally considered changing my mind anyway a fried zucchini plank sandwich with melted mozzarella and side of sauce i do love a good zucchini plank and had never heard of anyone creating a sandwich out of them so no hardship to change my order that was a greasy good lunch sandwichheavy on the greasy but ive always loved some tasty fried deliciousnesshubs had the sausage sandwich goodbut mine was the clear winnerstarter soups were homemade and tasty hubby had black bean and i had the chicken pastine aka wedding soup the broth rivaled my premium homemade christmas chicken soup broth so no complaints on that overall ambiance star mine and hubbys sandwiches  stars soup  stars average is a   not rushing back but id clearly have lunch there again if im across the street|im pretty much committed to trying every byob restaurant around so this was on my list for a long time friends told me it wasnt worth it but i persisted to the point that we went there for lunch yesterday my first reaction was not a pleasant one the cheap plastic chairs the small close together tables the tacky decorations not a good feel but i pressed on now i didnt avail myself of the byob might have resulted in a higher rating and it was only lunch so i cant comment on dinner regrettably i wont ever try them for dinner so this is the best i can offer  i think legends in their name only applies to the sports heroes and not any legendary food experience youll find here the place is essentially a diner diner atmosphere diner chairs diner specials diner everything not that i dont appreciate diners i do but this atmosphere is blah  id rate it a max of  stars max food on the other hand is ok not great ok worth going out of your way for absolutely not i had the parma hot sausage with a bowl of black bean soup both things i love were these memorable not in the least its generous to say they were adequate mamas gravy a marinara sauce of sorts was lackluster and flavorless the sausage was just a split link of hot sausage and something i could replicate at home with ease the black bean soup was listless and uninspired sad because i was expecting hoping for so much more  i wish i had ordered the chicken parm that the guys pressing up against me from behind ordered it looked way better but ill not have that chance cause i wont be going back ill drive by this place a thousand times to go to other more deserving places on the northside sorry didnt do it for me  cant even imagine coming here for dinner with a bottle of wine would be awful  i wanted to give it  stars but felt a little generous today plus i thought if i worked down the block id probably come here for lunch but never would i go out of my way to go here|watch out for the cold table in the pit in spite of requesting a move we were told all tables were bookedof course that was not true prices were inflated for  a limited valentines day menui have been there many times in past and raved about it to friends never again they are off my list|rated one of pittsburghs best in  i was excited to enter legends and prepare for  what was sure to be an amazing meal upon entering legends you get the immediate hole in the wall vibe a vibe that i love with diner style tables and chairs we started with the margarita bruschetta this was delicious increasing my already high expectations our waitress came back i ordered the penne vodka and was excited but overwhelmingly disappointed the sauce although good is simply ordinary ive been to countless italian restaurants in pittsburgh and could name at least  better than legends  had legends not received substantial praise i may have not been so disappointed but when youre touted as one of the best i expect nothing short to their benefit the restaurant is byob maybe this gets so much praise because everyones drunk before their meal is servedfood c service b|legends is a an old style americanitalian restaurant the restaurant is so small and they have a problem with managing customers people who came in with reservations waited for at least  minutes to get seated to their tables other people who walkedin were seated immediately if they promise to eat in less than an hour i guess they have reservations for other people for the same table but they want to get customers anyway i was able to witness all of that because i was seated on the bar table which has the cashierhost the food was less than average i tried  different orders  desserts nothing was impressing|first time here my parents raved about this place and how great the spots are we arrived at  in a sat night and were promptly seated at our tablewe ordered an app and unfortunately this is where our problems began they brought mussels instead of our mozzarella sticks but this was quickly corrected they were fair we had the brussel sprouts which were under cooked and did not have any parmesan cheese on them plus they were mixed in with large random pieces of lettuce so odd i was actually looking forward to the special ribeye topped with shrimp but unfortunately they had already sold out of the special amazing since it was so early on in the night and nothing else in the menu looked good it was all traditional oily foods plus who cant make a veal or chick parm its the easiest thing to make my parents had the spots and the portion was sooooo small and came on an plate all by itself i give them a  for presentation the best part of the meal was the wine oh yeah it was byob so i guess i did a good job at picking out the wine haha service was nice and friendly and she did apologize multiple times about the food but did nothing to make up for it wont be back anytime soon|its close to my neighborhood hence the  star but seriously its like walmart stuff at whole foods price for the same item it charges substantially higher  than target which is not even known for cheap grocery  i still go there because its close and i go for specific items on sale so its not bad but overall the store is way too pricy  for no good reason which is probably the reason it gets on my nerve the most over the years ive frequented many pricy groceries andronicos ca morton williams ny wegman md and whole foods everywhere  and these stores all had one common quality they carry nice stuff when i want to cook pretentious gourmet food they have every ingredient ready i dont expect every store to be cheap and carry good stuff like trader joes ergo i was never the one to oppose stores just because theyre pricy but this one is just pricy unjustifiably you can over charge me on truffle oil and duck confit but im not happy to be charged double on corn syrup and canola oil same brand same item nearly double the price even the cvs downtown dont overcharge as much so dont say this is for the location this is the definition of a rip off|the only reason to shop here is that going anywhere else is out of your way the prices our worse than other ge stores and i wonder why the produce is not very fresh and the meats never looks good  the store never looks very clean i was hopeful a couple of years ago when the store was refurbished and it was nicer for a while but now its back to its old ways i have friends that refuse to go there because of the scary parking lot where people sell things out of their cars and at the driveway exit if there is outside cameras the pgh police should take a look i wish there was an alternative to shop in the northside kuhns off brighton rd is about the same except the prices are better|it wasnt as horrid as the reviews would lead you to think just dont expect a gleaming suburbanstyle megamart and you will be fine|ok i need to stick up for this store after reading these other reviews  i live nearby and have shopped here multiple times a week for the past year or so  i find this store to be consistently clean and the employees to be helpful polite and efficient  despite being much smaller than most giant eagle stores this one offers a decent selection of international foods organic products and vegetarianvegan items  i regularly buy produce here and see no difference between the qualityfreshness of what this store offers and what other giant eagle stores sell  the main difference in the produce section is truly the lack of dim directional lighting that new and newly renovated stores use to give their produce that false gardenfresh glow  harsh overhead lighting doesnt create much of a mood but at least i can see clearly enough to choose the freshest itemsas for all the remarks about this stores clientelewow  its amazing how people in the politicallycorrect st century manage to find new ways to express thcentury bigotry  all the comments about thugs and bums and ebt cards  why dont you just say what you mean  better yet just stay in the homogenous suburbs where you can buy your moodlit grapes among your kindno this isnt the worlds greatest grocery store  yes i sometimes fantasize that it will close and a trader joes will move in  but its not the terrifying stinking hellhole full of rotten food and sneering employees that these other reviews portray it to be  in dozens of trips here ive never had anything but an ordinary inoffensive shopping experience  do you really need more from a small neighborhood grocery store|i hate to agree with the other poor reviews of this branch but this is definitely far from the best eagle in the city ill say upfront that i never felt unsafe the three times that i have been here however the quality of the produce from my experience is pretty poor the lines are always long and take forever to get through furthermore the stuff in the bakery and goodies are below par id recommend stopping in another giant eagle if you can however this location does have a redbox which is nice|why all the hate for this giant eagle sure its not in the ritzy part of town but they have everything all the other giant eagles have ive never gone here and not found what i needed dont be scared of people just because they are different than you this giant eagle gets the job done and is fine by me btw the charmingly ghetto picture is hilarious and well fitting bravo|ive had a lot of bad experiences at this store the employees have been rude so much that i just expect them to roll there eyes when i get deli meat lines are long and theres always a crowd of people hanging out front begging for money cigarettes or trying to sell their food stamps i have filed a complaint with corporate about this store before and i was contacted by a manager i do have to say that this manager really sincerely cares about this store and customer experience i talked to him for  minutes and he was polite and friendly his name is mr youngblood and he urges you to ask for a manager if youre having a bad experienceproduce selection is terrible there is not a meat counter in store and its just feels dirty this is the only grocery store on the north side so its not as easy to just go somewhere else sometimes when you get off work you dont want to drive  minutes to go to kuhns on mcknight|this is a small franchiseowned location that caters to the predominantly low income households in the area selection is quite limited throughout the store with limited quantities on the shelf of the items they do carry because of the area in which it is located the store is not hours as most giant eagles seem to be the pharmacy inside the store unlike the store itself is corporate owned and its staff is friendly and efficient a stark contrast to the rest of the storeonce again reflecting the relatively low income of the area this store serves there will be one of more jitneys unlicensed cabs effectively waiting outside the store willing to take you and your groceries home for a small fee in general if you can shop somewhere else you will probably want to|its upsetting that this giant eagle is in disarray  the shelves are not stocked well and last night there were broken bags of loose food in the frozen food section  this neighborhood deserves better  the location is convenient for me i just wish the store was cleaner and better managed  ive stopped in several times when the store is closed the hours are not as expansive as many of the other giant eagles that i shop at|get me some peanutzz we decided on a whim to try something different for a bar and this place indeed was saturdays there is a cover for the dj which was  this didnt seem so bad to me after coming from other cities where the covers are  and  and higher but i feel like the place could use the money peanutz is a small venue the bar area is narrow and cramped then to the left of it there is a dark area where the dj is along with some tables and then the stairs to the bathroom if you werent at the bar then people were just sitting at the tables starring at the dj or at you maybe one or two people were dancing to the music i thought the music was awesome though  a mix of old school and underground hip hop beers were so cheap  i think we paid  for three draft beers woot however some folks were smoking and the bathrooms were gross my jacket took a few days to air out the smell of the smoke i wont be returning even if peanutz offered some peanuts|i went here on a saturday night with a few friends  they had  a dj so there was a cover of   boo  im really adverse to covers unless theres something really great going on and considering i had never been in this place before i was taking a chance  for those that know me im not the gambling kind  but i thought ok its just  so its not like id be going broke  the music was fairly loud which made it difficult to talk and no one was dancing  it wasnt overly crowded which made it easy to get drinks  am i glad i checked this place out  sure but have i been to better dance clubsbars  yes  if youre in the area and looking for something to do then check it out but i wouldnt make a special trip to go here|i am a pretty easygoing guy i wouldve overlooked the facts that jim beam is your only bourbon  for some reason two drinks came out to   even with only  people in the bar the music was absolutely deafening  you charge a  cover for no discernible reason rolling blunts is apparently kosher inside the bar but sharing not so muchhowever i cant let this slide your claw machine is bullshit that is the weakest claw of all time and theres no chance it is ever picking up anything in that cage i feel violated and i want my dollar back i think thats some sort of weird pa tax thing|to start the bathrooms are disgusting with that being said i would never eat anything here again  this is a neighborhood bar for me  ive been in here a handful of times the crowd is never rowdy or out of control  the bar area is clean and the restaurant has a very nice mellow atmosphere i normally only drink coor light drafts which are  thats a lot of beer for less than  dollars  i have had the wings in the past before i saw what a disaster the bathrooms were  they fry their wings to order and they come out hot and fresh the patrons are a older work crowd not too may youngsters here  i have enjoyed myself here and will probably be going back again this weekend|im not really sure how to go about this review my nails look great and a full set here is  they do handpainted french manicures which turn out really nice  extra per polish color im going to also say that this salon isnt for everyone there are no peaceful water fountains and no soothing music actually the only music playing during my visit was drunk in love by beyonce from the grammys via laptop although im sure everyone can admit that performance was hotttt i didnt mind watching it againi was in  out in a half hour minutes and kim did a very nice job on my nails i would personally recommend kim the other nail lady was texting while working on someones nails even though the girl was only  she might make that a habit oh no no no i stopped in because i always ask my only  friends in pittsburgh where they go to get their nails done and they all have answered nails today on the north sideagain this salon is not for everyone however if youre pressed for time money a quick   youre good to go and can handle the sometimes loud clientele try them out|better than soho down the street fairly original menu reasonably priced|i really wasnt thrilled with our meal here the service was fine although a bit slow for a notsobusy wednesday night we started with the breaded zucchini which was about  breading  zucchini the breading was much too heavy and you could barely taste the vegetablei had the parmesan crusted chicken with pasta which seemed to be coated in the same breading they used on the zucchini still too heavy and altogether flavorless the chicken was cooked perfectly though it just needed some spices and salt and pepper for goodness sake the pasta was cooked well and the sauce was fine though my husband was not thrilled with his pasta primavera which was strangely enough very spicy though the server did warn us about this beforehand to her credit and again not much flavor and many of the veggies not cooked thoroughly|i have been to atria locations around the city  but this was my first time at the atrias location at pnc park on the north shore of pittsburgh my young professional group had an event there last night so it was a good chance to check it out our event was held upstairs and since we had a small group they wouldnt guarantee the private room downstairs it worked for the most part but those of us that sat in the back had trouble hearing the speakers and the lights were dim the noise from the diners downstairs plus the house music carried through and at times it was very loud and hard to hear i would say that its a good place for a group dinner but not for a speaking event i cant comment on fooddrink as i didnt have any the atmosphere is nice but i wasnt too impressed with the layout of the whole place didnt see to have a good flow to it also the bathrooms upstairs where our event was were out of order so everyone had to go downstairs to use the restrooms|the food is good and the portions are large  the service is terrible  the servers are just too cool to show any sort of hospitality  no personality or spark  i dont know if they hate working there or hate serving people  its puzzling  why be in the service business if you have a bad attitude  i have been here a couple of times and it doesnt change  they just look at you blankly like they dont understand what you are saying  ive never had a staring contest with a hostess before  its bizarre  i wonder if they are all on xanax|i love coming to pnc park in the summer if i get here early enough i stop by atrias and have a scotch johnny walker rocks no water what did that scotch ever do to you when i was eating meat id get the lobster bisque or a huge plate of pot roast nachos the meat that covered those nachos were perfectly cooked with a nice char outside moist and succulent inside lots of cheese and other nacho fixens good stuffthe burgers here are just as glorious nice crisp outside moist and tender inside good bun great bacon if i ordered it atrias is a great restaurant in pnc park but when i go to pnc park i want ballpark food so i head to atrias when the bucs are out of town|the food is acceptable they have a pretty wide range but narrow the menu on pirates game days i tried the seared ahi tuna it was good but nothing memorable the location appears to be the best thing about the place sitting outside on a warm evening looking at the city skyline and seeing people walk around before a pirates game is an interested dinner experience but dont go for the menu|i feel bad about giving this place such a meh review but every time i go thats exactly how i feel when i leave atrias is one of those places that ive never had any type of memorable service experience or food experience for that matteri cant say the food is bad but its not really great either i will say the service is always so its almost as if they dont realize you have other places to go you can just sit at their restaurant all day on the upside the busboys and girls are hounding your table filling your water glass after taking a sip so if youre a horse you wont go thirstyhonestly though you are better off eating the park i mean who doesnt love mannys bbq|as your standard restaurant atrias has no personality the food is blah the service is eh and nothing is really all that memorable  the patio and its proximity to the ball parks are its saving grace  now lets talk about when we reserved a room for a bridal shower  we had a fixed menu for a group of about  ladies  i understand that  but when the bride asks for no tomatoes you as a server do not say no substitutions in your meanest voice  lighten up its her day  i ended up just taking the tomatoes off for herand just chalked it up to another maid of honor duty  the server also kept clearing the brides drinks while she mingled  this was annoying but at least we had paid a flat fee for drinks so it wasnt the hugest dealoverall the server for the brides table was just awful and kept treating us like little children  yes the table was the bridal party and the brides cousins  yes we are all under   but we are also young professionals and the ones who booked the event  the servers who waited on the rest of the tables containing the mothers aunts great aunts and grandmothers were politeeven when my nearsenile grandmother started yelling about bandits  later another server apologized on behalf of our bad server and mumbled that he just must be on his periodwhile atrias is fine for a glass of wine before a pirates game if a table is open outside i certainly would never book it again for a private function|atrias is a pretty good restaurant if youre at or near pnc park  as expected from anything located in a ballpark its not the best restaurant ever but its consistently decent  on different visits i have tried the margherita flatbread and cheese dip which were both fine although the fried pita chips were really salty as well as the diablo pasta which was okay and the pork filet gorgonzola which was quite good  in an ideal world i would walk over the bridge and eat at a more unique restaurant downtown but when i have to choose from something nearby atrias is one of the better choices  a number of my colleagues prefer this as their goto restaurant and while im not quite as enamored as them i definitely consider this an aok restaurant and ill be back|located right next to pnc park so is a decent place to get a beer and some grub prior to game day that and outdoor seating are main perks otherwise food and prices are not worth a stop this place will fill up on game day but should be avoided when the pirates arent in town it isnt a bad experience if you are siting outside and you have a view of pittsburgh it cant be that bad|having lived near this atrias location in the past i can say that ive spent more than my fair share of time at the pnc park atrias my wife and i stopped in this past week and for me i was reminded of why i enjoy atriasbut this having been our first time at atrias together and witnessing my wifes experience i realized why the place could garner such low reviewsfor someone like myself whos actually had enough positive and negative food experiences at atrias to know exactly what to order and what to steer clear of i can make the experience a positive one but thats a situation im afforded now thanks to my previous patience and convenience my wife opting to stray from my suggestions had an awful dinner her plate of bland fish and asparagus left her turned off completely luckily we were using a gift card so it wasnt as frustrating for her as it couldve been regardless walking away from an entire plate of food is dishearteningthat led me to realize this if youre only at atrias once youre odds arent that great of having a good experience thats just the reality of the situation there are a handful of really good things on the menu that i love the parmesan crusted chicken is really good although it can sometimes be a little too oily the pot roast is excellent but its way too heavy for most of the yearespecially during baseball season when theyre busier their chili is really onpointespecially paired with their bread and the salmon salad is excellent although i dont like the salmon so i swap the salmon for chicken for a great salad option the carrot cake is insanely good but truth be told its not homemade i could care less though as its still some of the best carrot cake ive ever eaten period other notable items are the pot roast nachos crab cakes red skin smashed potatoes and the reubenthats really where the positives end though ive learned to steer clear of the burgers because of the inconsistency with which theyre prepared ive received more undercooked burgers at atrias than any other restaurant and its just not worth the gamble anymore my filets have always been perfectlyprepared but the one time i got a strip it was practically burned on one side and undercooked on the other failing to cook burgers and steaks correctly isnt that surprising but deciding to serve them to customers despite their incorrect preparation is surprisingand poori know that the last time i had salmon on my salad the fish tasted off and i paid the price for it later ive never given a single fish meal a chance there since were talking years now hence my request for chicken on my salads now most of the meals that ive had are average and ive practically tried the entirety of the menu over the years so believe me when i say itwhy do i continue to go well because the few items that i do love are craveworthy and having become a regular less so nowadays the service that i received at the bar was always excellent daniel and roy have always provided  great service to me and good service goes the distance as far im concerned so its been worth stopping in from timetotime unfortunately if i cant sit at the bar i dont always stick around as the service at the tables is really hitormiss for every good server they have they have two more that could care less about their jobsespecially during peak timesregardless this is my favorite atrias location because its the least stuffy and pretentious location of them all but theres still a lot of room to improveand i hope it does|i was neither particularly pleased nor dissatisfied with my lunch experience here it was just meh its kinda pricey for what you get but the service is prompt and friendly and the music is fun and modernthey serve a mean crab bisque it was deliciously creamy quite generous with the crab meat and very filling without that nasty sick afterfeeling the coconut shrimp with a nice crunchy coconuty breading was also very tasty and the portion was satisfyingly large for an app the house salad was just a typical salad of iceberg and romaine lettuce drenched in shredded cheddar cheese and sprinkled with a few other veggies nothing special  just a random quirk i noticed  for being a rather classy restaurant i was surprised that they didnt add a slice of lemon to my glass of water though im sure you could ask for it  would i recommend the place probably not but it was certainly not a bad experience just one that didnt stand out for the money youll spend|i have a dream a dream that some day the north shore will have a ton of amazing food options i hope one day it will become a reality for now i think theres a smattering of okayish places and a lot of mediocrity maybe its just the built in crowd you come to a game you gotta eat right and what are you going to eat either at a restaurant outside the stadium or inside at this point id stick with inside for the novelty of it all i stopped into atrias on game day but came in right as the first pitch was going out so it wasnt packed in the least our server was obviously not into us as well as serving that day as she was pretty short with us the entire time sorry we bothered youthe menu is incredibly limited with around  apps  sandwiches and  main courses i get that theyre probably just limiting things for the crowded times but i felt like nothing really called to me i settled on going halfies and ordering an app and waiting until i was inside the stadium to get my main course crab fries naturally but thats beside the pointthe pieorgies we ordered were okay they were doused in parmesan cheese and a little overcooked but it wasnt the worst thing ive ever had wasnt the best either i think what really turned me off was the whole experience service small selection and mediocre food i should have just ordered two buckets of crab fries and called it a night|there are not many options for good dining on the north shore and by process of elimination this is where we ended up during a pirates game  we were seated pretty quickly and they have options for indoor and outdoor dining it was opening day and quite crowded but our server did a nice job i started off with a corona my big disappointment was they had a special game day menu and it was very limited with not many options  i went with the cobb salad and it was very goodfresh veggies and a nice portion size  i do think that the prices are a little high|came in late night during light the night just for for drinks and a snack service was fast but the salad and cup of soup were disappointing the chopped salad had weird cheap ingredients like celery and carrot i was excited about the crab bisque but they must have been running low and it must have been half sherry because it tasted like i was taking a shot of cheap white wine with every bite hope the dinner fare is better|average experience the entrees that we chose chicken marsala and chicken piccata were fine but under seasoned the cheese plate was the best part of the meal four cheeses selected and served by carole dear heart from penn mac exceptional choices good crusty bread and shes lovely and a pittsburgh institution service was spotty i was there representing my company we produced the music that evening im not sure if the server assumed that we wouldnt be ordering food or what but after we ordered the cheese course and wine he came back only to attempt to take away our menus not to take our order i had to ask to order entrees it was just odd ive heard similar things from others that have been there on our music nights|i decided to check out downtown pittsburgh on my trip for a family visit recently we took a walk around the area and this location caught our eye it had outdoor seating and was right outside of pnc park we decided on the pot roast nachos as an appetizer it was pretty good nice chunks of pot roast and various cheeses i than decided on the atria combo which had andouille sausage perogies chicken and sauerkraut i figured that this would be something different the sausage was great and so were the perogies i did not care for the chicken too much it was dark meat with bread crumbs i prefer white meat so that was probably the reason i also tasted my friends steak  hoagie i am from the area so i have had better it was a little dry and not enough cheese and onions the outdoors ambiance was great pittsburgh has a great downtown nothing like detroit it was alive various things to do and was a beautiful city overall the restaurant was a good experience the waiter was great and funny also we also talked to some people sitting beside us it made for a good time however i would opt for another place when i visit again|nothing special here i went with a group the beef was a little salty and the breaded chicken parmesean was equally as unimpressive the breading was soggy and lacked any crispiness and the dessert was obviously catered from elsewhere like a local supermarket dessert tray|this is more of a  star rating i visited this restaurant with a large group of about  people before going to a show at the new hazlett theater we were seated upstairs and ate a buffetstyle dinner the dishes had already been picked the two waiters who took care of us were extremely friendly and efficient and they made sure we would leave in time for our show while we waited for the food to come out they served us drinks but the waiter stopped offering straws after the first couple tableswhen the food came out they let a few tables help themselves at a time they provided us with three different types of plates large square ones rectangular ones and small circular ones which i found odd we had three entrees in the buffet line chicken marsala tomato vodka pasta and parmesan crusted tilapiachicken marsala flavorful tender chicken served with mashed potatoes i really enjoyed the potatoes because they had a distinct potato flavor unlike most butterheavy ones however i wish they were more generous with the tomatoes and mushrooms in the dish there was no vegetablebased dish in our entire meal and i missed themtomato vodka pasta penne cooked with just a little bite left in a yummy tomato sauce with a couple leaves of spinach here and there again i wished there was a lot more spinach in the dish also the pasta was a little sauceheavyparmesan crusted tilapia the fish was crispy and delicious the angelhair pasta was cooked perfectly and the tomato sauce was good i grabbed some pasta near the edge that hadnt been touched by sauce so i liked the amount no vegetables thoughafterwards they brought out a tray of bitesize desserts for us i dont see any of them on their menu so im not sure how the organization ordered them both the cheesecake flavors i tried raspberry and almond were deliciousthe cheesecake was really light and airy and the flavors really came through without being overly sweet or overpowering they also had strawberry halves and chocolate chip cookies which were soft and cakeynot the best ive ever had but pretty good also there were these little squares that as far as i could tell were squares of iced cake covered in chocolate these were way too sweet for my taste mine looked like chocolate everything but there were also whitechocolate covered squares and other squares with different colors inside different flavors of icing perhapsoverall i enjoyed the food but id like to try a greater variety before giving four full stars and see if there are any vegetableheavy ones however this restaurant is a little too expensive for me to return any time soon the service was great|i really wanted to like this place but everything about it was extremely disorganized only one bartender was able to get anything accomplished and thankfully he was the one serving me the rest of the staff seemed to have no direction and the aforementioned bartender was the one picking up their slack try as he could he could not do it all and this was only  hours before game time it was bound to get busier as the day moved onthat said the food was good hawaiian chicken sandwich and there is an extensive beer selection i will certainly give atrias another shot when i return to the burgh|although my meat was dry the food overall was delicious my chicken breast smothered in mushrooms and onions with cheddar jack cheese the homemade chips and my wifes pittsburgher kielbassi slices with pierogies sour cream sauerkraut and mustard  we were not brought or offered bread  what brought down this rating was service problems which obviously were not the fault of our server  i appreciated that the restaurant offered me a reservation when open table indicated that nothing was available on this day the hostess did not seem to know how to handle a reservation and i do not believe that our arrival was matched to it she asked another individual for assistance and i believe that person told her simply to seat us after more than ten minutes had passed after we were seated without a server coming to the table the hostess came over to ask if she could take a drink order  she was not able to answer my question about whether the featured beers were draft or bottled  soon thereafter our server a charming and gracious young man came to take the drink order  we asked him to take our dinner order as well given that this was stacking up to be a very lengthy meal  more than fifteen minutes later our entrees came but no sign of my wifes wine and my beer  i asked the young man who brought the food about our drinks and a few minutes later our server came over apologized and told us how backed up the bar was  he graciously told us that the drinks would be complimentary  we received them more than five minutes after the arrival of our entrees  these were not mixed drinks requiring anything special to dispense simply beverages that had to be poured  for almost the entire time we were there a band was playing inside at a volume that was deafening  we could not possibly have had our meal inside near the band as it would have been necessary to use sign language to converse and to order we were seated outside as far away from the music as possible yet it was still difficult to speak to each other over the din  additionally the placement of the band in a small room makes it particularly difficult to snake in and out when coming in to use the restroom the menu at this atrias is a bit different from the traditional locations and some of the prices are not the same for items that are identical  the homemade chips are  at traditional atrias locations  at pnc park for a smaller portion|i have enjoyed dining at atrias over the years  i used to love their pot roast nachos but a few years ago they changed the recipe the pot roast is nowhere near as generous as it used to be  but i would say the food is reliably good and the service is generally excellent except when they are overwhelmed on game days  i do have a great story about meeting hulk hogan at this location once so i do have a special fondness for atrias  they are well managed and local  but the dining scene in pittsburgh has become a lot more creative i think atrias needs to keep up and offer something new and different  until then its still pretty good and fairly reliable|we arrived at pm on a busy sat nite a party of  we agreed to sit  and  we were at bar for a bit while waiting and bar tender was friendly and made us feel welcome when our tables were ready we were not given menus for about  minutes when we flagged down a bartender who brought them over and took our orders food took at least  more minutes to arrive salmon was great but not much rice and would have been better with a veggie side to round it out food overall was fine they ended up comping some of our drinks|this would probably be a star review if id brought a younger kid my  yearold dd had fun for about an hour and then was done  just not as much for her age group the thing she loved the most by far was the gravity room  she ran through it about  times trying to not fall down the floor i liked the projector kaleidoscope where you used different fabric swatches to change the picture other than that it felt like any other childrens museum  fun enough for the kids tiresome for the adults oh  but as a child of the s i did find it very cool to see mr rogers puppets in the cases  never thought id see king friday in person|cant get an order right  of the last  times we ordered they have messed it up   i know each time i forgive them and think they cant possibly mess up again but they do  not only that but they quote  minutes then take anywhere from  hours to deliver  wont be ordering from here again|okay hold the phone i wouldnt call pickles an emporiumi havent actually eaten their sandwiches what i typically order is the bacon cheddar fries which are pretty damn tasty for a pizza shop  anyway on the bacon cheddar fries there is tons of melted cheese and real bacon  oh yeah  a total guilty pleasure anyway i was raised eating at pickles this was our go to pizza place at home but not due to quality but more do their willingness to deliver to our house  in the neighborhoods i live in the pizza man dont deliver around here anymore  for some tasty fries i would highly recommend pickles for anything else i would suggest going else where|i lived off of pickles in college  the only downfall was their delivery time  it always took almost an hour and a half to receive my food  minutes down the road i moved still in delivery distance and had a terrible experiencei called my order in and had a total of  and some change  i told them id be laying cash  when the delivery guy arrived he couldnt stop complaining about walking up my steps and i would have to meet him downstairs next time  when i handed him a  he told me sorry i dont have any change  so he walked off with a  dollar tip after being terribly late rude and forgot my drinkgood food but rude service on the phone and in person i have not been back since|
