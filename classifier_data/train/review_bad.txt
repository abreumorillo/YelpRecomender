wing sauce is like water pretty much a lot of butter and some hot sauce franks red hot maybe  the whole wings are good size and crispy but for  a wing the sauce could be better the hot and extra hot are about the same flavorheat  the fish sandwich is good and is a large portion sides are decent|this place is absolute garbage  half of the tees are not available including all the grass tees  it is cash only and they sell the last bucket at  despite having lights  and if you finish even a minute after  dont plan on getting a drink  the vending machines are sold out of course and they sell drinks inside but close the drawers at  on the dot  there are weeds grown all over the place  i noticed some sort of batting cage but it looks like those are out of order as well  someone should buy this place and turn it into what it should be|owning a driving range inside the city limits is like a license to print money  i dont think i ask much out of a driving range  decent mats clean balls and accessible hours  hell you need even less people now with the advent of the machine that doles out the balls  this place has none of them  it is april and there are no grass tees yet  btw they opened for the season this week although it has been golfing weather for a month  the mats look like the carpet at my  year old aunt irenes house  worn and thread bare  lets talk about the hours  this place is equipped with lights yet they only sell buckets of balls until   it is still light out  finally lets you have the pit to hit into  when i arrived i wasnt sure if this was a driving range or an excavation site for a mastodon or a strip mining operation  there is no grass on the range just mud  makes it a good tool to figure out how far you actually are hitting the ball  oh they are cash only alsobottom line this place sucks  the best hope is that the owner sells it to someone that actually wants to make money and service golfers in pittsburgh|waited over  mins  people ahead of me and im finally getting helped  wtfi can understand them being busy but that was ridiculous  i work out in robinson and went to the settlers ridge location and boy what a difference  they were awesome  in  out the door in  minutes i ended up with a new s and my wife ordered a splus all in less than  minutes  ill never go to this store anymore|my fianc upgraded his phone at the apple store but got a strange text on his new phone about his plan we went over to the verizon store to see what was up and that was about as pleasant as having forks jammed in my eyes awful customer service no one came up to ask us if we needed help we had to tear a disgruntled man away from looking at his instagram feed to help us he didnt say there would be a wait or to sit or anything just said okay then and left us so we stood there waiting for help or even just directions for far too long were ignored and told him we were leaving awful awful awful customer service|dont go here this place is a scam when it comes to opening freezing and canceling your membership it is not easy or convenient and they get every last penny from you for a mediocre gym with sweaty smelly locker rooms go to la fitness bad experience here|used to go there for tires brakes etc  their prices have gone way up for  midlevel tires for a toyota  plus  of the new tires went flat within  weeks  since they dont make appointments  the wait to get the tire looked at was  hours  sorrycant wait that long to get a warranted repair  they lost my business for good|terrible preordered my tires and when i arrived they couldnt find the order anywhere once we got through that process i waited over  hours for them to be put on i was originally told it would take  mins slow over priced ill go elsewhere next time|i got new tires from them and within two weeks got a flat i took my car to a local mechanic to see if i could get the hole patched but they said the reason i had a flat was because the previous patch had blown  wait what i just got the tire and never needed to have it patched this was supposed to be a new tire i took the tire over to flynns and they told me that someone punctured my tire then tried to patch it so there are resentful tire slashers i find that very unlikely after arguing with the guy and telling him that his logic was far fetched he said hed give me a new tire this time i will never go back to flynns bc of the way this guy treated me and the simple fact that they gave me a used tire|last summer i had an appointment to get new tires and had to wait a super long time i also went in this week for them to fix a minor problem with a tire they put on they fixed it for free and the very next morning i had the same issue i called to complain and the manager didnt even apologize so frustrated never going back  they seem overpriced too|dont waste your time  we had two different people come to our house to give us estimates for a deck one of them the owner  both times we never heard from them  not a call not the estimate nothing|i cant believe this place has a high rating i had a bichon who was seen here since his puppyhood and who was dying i called to make an appointment to have him put down because he was in great pain the receptionist would not give me an appointment until one week later even though she could hear him crying out in pain anyway he died in agony before his appointment this was in  and i have not taken my subsequent pets to the clinic|never go to rossi tailoring and dry cleaners  vanadium road pittsburgh pa  i decided to use a local business to do my dry cleaning i dropped off  shirts at this establishment just before thanksgiving it is now late january i have stopped by more than a half dozen times and have been given only one of the shirts they have offered  a shirt for the shirts they lost those shirts are worth at least  each and i refuse to take under  for each i am tired of the run around tired of promised phone calls that never happen they have never called me  i wouldnt use their services again if you paid me to|station is closed  sign is blank and all fixtures from the store have been removed|thomas darbyi will never stay at this extended stay america due to the fact that we were there in october  and had an awful stay room was only cleaned one time after asking three times when it would be cleaned there was absolutely nothing in the supposedly full kitchen  wash clothes  hand towels and  towels we had to take used wash clothes and towels to front desk every day to receive fresh ones the toilet ran over and the heater didnt work until we decided to leave we were over charged after booking through hotelscom and had to put up a  deposit for what never again will we stay there|if i could give this place less than one star i would i have no idea who gave this place high reviews but they must either own the place or be time travelers from back in the day when this place might not have sucked the decor is tired and grimy the place reeked of smoke and the bartenderserver was surly to put it mildly we went there on a saturday night with a mind to try the irish food apparently we were out of luck ive always thought that the secrets of restaurant success is to actually stock food for people to eat he told us before we ordered that they had no pies no chicken pot pie no shepherds pie etc so we gamely tried to order other things we placed our order my wife for example ordered the irish stew and he came back  min later telling us they were out of that and even more things for several people in our party at that point my wife picked out a third option ham and cabbage only to be told again that they were out at that point realizing that the only food to be had in the place was what was crusted on the menus we asked to pay for our drinks and left they actually then gave us flack for not having enough to put it on a debit card in short unless you like your dinner with a side of disappointment and depression id probably avoid this place like the plague speaking of the plague i suppose we should thank mr surly for inspiring us to walk out i only have two bathrooms at my house and wouldve been hard pressed to accommodate several violently ill people at once|the delivery driver mistakenly rang my doorbell having confused  and rather than taking a step back and analyzing the situation he begins to accuse my wife and i of ordering and refusing to pay for this pizzathe driver then gets on his cell phone and rather than calling the number than was given when the order was placed begins to call his bosses and starts threatening me with felony charges so i take the initiative and ask the fine upstanding gentleman what the phone number of the orderer was phone my neighbor and discover the mistake rather than a thank you or a sorry he just speeds off breaking the speed limit on our block to reach his destination  feet awayi would call to complain but based on the other reviews its clear the owners do not care about carnegie or its residents and its pretty well known around town just how awful their food is so it would be pointless to boycott a place id never order from again anywaydo yourself a favor and order from any other establishment in town|some of the worst pizza ive ever had  we used a coupon from the paper for a  topping  cut sicilian first of all the pizza wasnt even cut through and the sad attempt at cutting was so uneven that  of the slices were about an inch wide while the others were about  each the toppings were scarce they used mini pepperoni and put maybe  on the whole pizza the onions were huge chunks and the mushrooms were straight from a can the worst part though was the thick doughy crust that tasted more like a fishy sourdough roll im serious it was so noticeable that it made me wonder if the dough was bad or if they for some weird reason put fish sauce in it it was gross we also ordered steak and italian hoagies the veggies were old and wilted and there was no dressing on either the italian had deli meat that was clearly bottom of the line and not very generous the steak if you an call it that was greyish instead of brown and looked like it was a processed meat chopped into pieces no flavor or seasoning and the texture was reminiscent of spam it was so bad that i only ate  of it and tossed the rest i have ordered from here in the past and always been disappointed i thought i would give them another try since id never ordered a sicilian pizza from there what a mistake i will never order from them again|unprofessional  we ended up here due to being recommended by the insurance company it was my fault for leaving an ipod in the vehicle but regardless it was stolen the owner would not take responsibility for the theft and firmly stood by his employees he did say that the cars are occasionally left unlocked outside the building bad practice  nonetheless i am out an ipod and he is out everyones business that asks me for a recommendation for auto repair lock the cars|im an elite yelp member and i try to say positive on all local businesses that being said i can positively say stay away from this body shop i was with nationwide at the time of my front end accident and they told me to go here because they were part of their blue ribbon program in my eyes this meant that this shop had clout and were a reputable shop what i didnt realize this meant was that nationwide would basically get substantial discounts in return for them sending most of their bodyshop repairs this way the owner and his wife run the shop my accident happened in  i called them and they told me to bring it in they took pics and then sent me on my way told me it would take about a week to get the bumper side fenders and new hood in they would repaint and reattach they also ordered new headlightsshowed up a week later the only positive aspect was they took pics which were available online to show the progress of the car throught the weekafter a week i picked it up it looked okay he never replaced the undertray which was damaged in the accident which would lead to problems down the road he also forgot to cover the back of the car which got some overspray from the primer how this happened when he painted the front of the car is beyond me im assuming they were painting a car next to minehere is where i am dissapointed with his service after a week the bumper started falling off also the new headlight he put in started getting condensation in it which proved to me he never actually replaced it i called and tried to set up an appointment but none of my messages were answered after getting him on the phone he told me i needed to set up an appointment to come look at it i showed up and he told me it would take more money to fix are you kidding me the insurance company and i coughed up k so you could partially put it back together and then not want to fix it once it was falling apart he told me i must have hit a curb and knocked the bumper off he would not take responsibility for his lack of quality work do not go here i complained to nationwide to remove them from their repair shop list but my complaints went unheardi ended up going private party to redo his shotty work|by far the worst most unprofessional dentist i have ever experienced her staff is too busy watching soap operas on all the tvs in each room instead of cleaning and she gave me a filling which was too deep which could have been understandable as her son had his pictures delivered from hawaii and she had to stop  times to pay for them and show her whole staff all of them must be nice to have a  year old go to hawaii on her moms dime and have her patience wait to see all of this happen i had to have oral surgery and have the tooth removed because she put the filling in too deep an abscessed tooth was the result i wouldnt recommend her to an ex girlfriend or someone i hate because of the three months of extreme tooth pain i had to deal with because of her lack of care and follow through even after i called and asked them for advice and follow up they simply could care less and did not even offer to reschedule an appointment other than prescribing me vicodin and antibiotics do not recommend and do not go to her license should be pulled|in all fairness  i did not see this dentist but did schedule an appointment and waited  minutes for them to openwhen i look at yelp reviews i usually weed out the outliers the best and the worst   unfortunately there are only two reviewsit was my first time at the office   the office admin very nice asked for me to come early before am to complete paperwork   i arrived at     i waited   i watched  employees walk by me unlocked the door and relocked it    they did not acknowledge methe door i was at had signage open hours    i decided to leave because of a review where the staff seemed distracted or disinterested in my presencethe office admin very nice called me to inform i am missing my appointment   i explained to her that there were too many indications where this was not going to be a good fit and wished her the best of lucki recommend if you see this dentist you go to the front door furthest away from the parking lot for the entrancepoor recommendation because the staff who walked by me seemed to be distracted which was pointed out in a previous review|ive been to this office a good amount of times  each time the receptionists give of a vibe of entitlement and it is very uncomfortable  dr weinberg herself is very nice but i doubt her ability every procedure she has done to my teeth has backfired the third and last issue i have is that i always paid cash at the end of my visits and somehow i have received an invoice for  i called and of course the receptionist was sassy and rude so i gave up will never go back or refer anyone else|take it from me avoid this place at all cost  the only time i go is when i am starved and dont have the energy to cook or get edible food  and then after i have been kicking myself|i use to order here fairly often  the past  years their food has been getting progressively worse every time i order  it doesnt help that the owner that always is at the register is so rude to me every time  i finally decided that im done  i dont think i should feel let an inconvenience when ordering food from a restaurant  let alone one that the food isnt even that good also the inside is dirty as heck  they can deliver food in a bmw but they cant buy a scrub brush  i have found golden dragon in collier square is  times better then don don|they gladly have you come in for a consultation cleaning just to tell you they work on children but when you try to get actual work done on your child they all the sudden refer you to childrens good scam to get that cleaning visit from patients but dont do any work i will be looking for a dentist for all  of my boys that actually works|i spoke to a man this morning about the ice covered parking lot and sidewalk as a business is liable to their customers if someone was to slip and fall due to negligence on the businesss part he told me good luck and that im liable to just be careful because everywhere is icy after two years at this gym im fed up with the way they treat their customers he told me he was fed up with me since i gave him a hard time about being out of towels a few weeks ago which theyve had towels since then they never clean the parking lot in the winter so make sure you wear boots outside and dont crash your car aside from that this gym is well just that a gym my biggest critic aside from rude management and negligence would have to be that they dont encourage sanitization outside of the cardio room there arent towels and spray around the weight machines which ive never had an issue with but id hate to see that happen i always make sure to at least wipe off my sweat marks from the machine cause well thatd be pretty nasty it is pretty large in terms of size and space to do anything aside from the ordinary weights and cardio the workers well theyre mostly young and dont really care too much the man who told me i was wrong was older and possibly a manager or owner they tend to not keep on top of the wash with the towels even when it isnt busy which can be pretty annoying their cardio room always has fox news on two tvs and then the middle tv has sports center on regardless of what else is on tv they recently havent even been putting pens games and stuff on must be too busy watching the  inch screen they have in the lobby for the workers while the cardio room has max  in the middle and  on the sides probably if i had to pay full price for my membership i probably wouldnt belong here but its through my insurance that said i dont swipe my card like most people in the front on my own the machine is behind the counter one guy always shows me how to do it myself which was helpful the first time cause people arent always around the front desk that said when he is standing behind there chatting i would expect him to do it since its his job this gym is nothing state of the art fancy fancy but do you really need a fancy looking gym their cardio room is pretty massive and even at peak hours ive never had a problem getting a treadmill or elliptical they actually even have two hellix trainers which arent super common yet sometimes when things go out of order they take a while to fix them ive run into the owner or manager one time in the bathroom when someone let a sink over floor and asked if i should tell the guys at the desk and she said oh no theyre useless this gym makes a killing from a classes b its convenient and c their personal training is a separate company warrior fitness ive been meaning to sign up for a trainer and i always see them busy they all seem awesome and very helpful and challenging not sure if they have a separate yelp page but i would say from what ive seen theyd bust your ass for sure|terrible service  food unremarkable  waiter disappeared for  minutes to serve larger group due to staffing mismanagement  saved his tip by discounting meal after i complained  all and all a very crude and unpleasant dining experience for me and my guests  not to be repeated never again|i have been to this restaurant twice and was disappointed both times i wont go back the first time we were there almost  hours it took forever to order and then forever for our food to come and the place was empty when i complained the manager was very rude and tried to blame us for taking to long to order it made no sense how could we order when the waitress wasnt coming to the table after arguing with me he ended up taking  off of our  bill ridiculous if it were up to me i would have never returned unfortunately my family decided to go here again tonight again it took a long time to get our food my food was cold and bland my kids food was cold my husbands salmon was burnt to a crisp and my sister in law took one bite of her trout and refused to eat any more because she claims it was so disgusting the wedding soup and bread were good but thats it my drink sat empty throughout my meal and never got refilled even when i asked bad food slow service and rude managers ill pass on this place if my family decides to go again not worth it at all with all the other good italian options around|we stopped at papa js last friday night  for a round of drinks there were  of us altogether and we had eaten at another restaurant earlier in the evening  one member of our party walked up to the bar to let them know we were sitting on the couches along the wall as it was fairly busy that night in the short time that he was there a man who was behind the bar looked at him and then turn away without saying a word or notifying anyone else he then turned to a waitress who had approached the service area of the bar and asked her if  we could have a server take our drink order she said yep and then abruptly turned and walked away at that point he asked to see the manager  who came a few minutes later when my friend told him of what had occurred the manager said what do you want me to domy friend said an apology would be a good start whereupon the manager looked back at him and said get out and dont come back  are you kiddingmy friend is well traveled and frequently stays at higher end hotels and dines at quality restaurants he was not screaming or belligerent in any way shape or form simply informing the manager of what had occurred that being said we left and went back to  east where we had previously eaten the service there was fabulous as was the meal and the drinks creative and exquisitethere are new restaurants that have opened in carnegie as of late papa js is no longer the only game in town  obviously this is the way a simple complaint is handled by management appalling  do yourself a favor and frequent any of the other restaurants that are within walking distance of papa js they understand the concept of  customer service|food was not good at all my husband  i ate here a couple weeks ago for the first time i ordered a salad  basil pesto cream pasta  my husband ordered the spinach  feta pasta the salad was just a huge plate of spring mix nothing else in it with way to much vinegar dressing my lettuce was drowning in the vinegar my pesto pasta had no flavor did not taste like a cream sauce to me  the pesto was so runnywatery  way too much sauce not enough noodles my husbands pasta had even less flavor than mine we ate about a quarter of the food  couldnt even finish it we took it home  it was so bad i didnt even eat my leftovers and i hate wasting food plus the prices are expensive for the amount of food you get  of course the poor quality dont waste your time eating here there are much better italian restaurants in pittsburgh|had dinner with a friend my friend ordered veal and they brought him sausage the waitress was extremely rude he never did get the correct meal when we talked to the manager his answer  was well what do you want me to do fire the waitress too many good restaurants in that area to tolerate bad attitude|ive never posted a yelp review before  this meal was so horrible that i downloaded the yelp app just so i could warn others to stay away  we ordered food from capri since we were going to voodoo brewery  we ordered a cheesesteak with no mayo and an italian calzone since the person working there talked up the calzones  we ended up with a cheesesteak heavy on the mayo and an italian wedgie which was just a folded up pizza full of mayo and onions  no sign of italian meat to be found  no marinara sauce  it was inedible  we ended up walking to kfc instead  i want to leave a zero star rating but yelp wont let me  so they get an undeserved star|we visited on  with a party of   while i know a party of  can be overwhelming we did call in advance for reservations thus allowing proper staffing we arrived early and headed to the bar the bartender there greeted us quickly and took great care of us when it was time for our reservation we were seated immediately that is where the efficiency and service took a turn for the worst we sat for  minutes before a server came to our table at that point she said ill grab you water and bread  another  minutes go by and members of our party went to the bar to grab drinks as the server vanished still no water or bread she finally comes back to the table with bread no waters and takes our drink orders about  mins into sitting at the table next thing we know a nice gentleman by the name of patrick is our new server he really stepped up the service and should be commended however we ordered the veal stuffed banana peppers which arrived cold we also ordered the incredible white pizza which was incredibly cold while patrick stepped up the service the entire experience was fairly terriblenot once did the front of house manager come check on us this is the second time ive visited and the nd time ive been disappointedalso i wrote to the restaurant and received no response|any time ive ever stepped in to randys there is a very odd smell that immediately makes me want to turn around and walk out bartenders dont seem friendly and if you arent a regular expect to get weird vibes from the regularswith all of the other options in the area take your money elsewhere|you would think their exorbitant prices would at least buy some decent customer service not at this location they are totally understaffed and have almost nobody able or willing to help you find anything this is a problem because they carry so many completely different products that its hard to find what you need expect to wait at least a half hour before getting assistancethe organization is disjointed especially depending on your project theres even a section called art supplies i thought that was kind of the point of the whole store what did it in however was how miserably they packed my picture frames the place next door wrapped two dollar drinking glasses in paper to protect them but apparently michaels thinks a grocery bag is sufficient to protect a nice picture frame in bad weather so the inevitable happened and i dropped the bag now i dont expect every place to be sympathetic even though it could have been packed better but when i asked for a refund they were down right rude hey i did drop the thing but some empathy would have been nice i wasnt completely out of line asking because a little bubble wrap and it would have been fine in the first place i will never be back to this or any other michaels|i went here at  pm between the lunch rush and the dinner rush and the restaurant was maybe  full i ordered the chili mac supreme to go i thought i would be in and out within  minutes keep in mind that this restaurant even has a drivethru the expectation is quick servicelong story short my food never came the waitress told me after i had been sitting there waiting for thirty minutes that the kitchen hadnt even started on my order yet so i told her to cancel it and walked out now i see that others on yelp have warned about the slow service at this location wish i had looked it up earlier|this is the absolute worst steak n shake ive ever been to the bf and i got lost around pittsburgh for  min trying to find this location and on top of the unnecessary  hour wait for our food the food itself was just so crappily made it was so bad and we had waited a ridiculous amount of time cmon steak n shake is basically a glorified mcds our waiter comped our whole mealif not for the compensation i would have been pissed that we had to pay for such a crappy meal the bf on the other hand was more upset about the principle of the matter we had trekked all that way just to get our steak n shake fix since both of us havent had it since our undergraduate days and it was a major faili think im good with my steak n shake craving for a long time nowps the whole joint smells like major bo|the only thing worse than the food is the service|this was the most horrible experience at a restaurant i have had in yearsi was there at around pm with about  folks from my family visiting relatives included there were several things that got me annoyed one after another i was ok that it took a while for us to be seated but after we ordered what really got me angry was that the food took a very long time to arrive we had  kids with us and we ordered  kids meals and had asked for those to be brought sooner after about  minutes of nothing i went to the servers who were just not paying attention to us anyway  the main servers name for our table was angel and asked where our meals were one checked with another who then informed me that they were working on it what made me even angrier is that they tried to downplay everything telling me that it had only been  minutes then one of the servers manager tells me that ok may be its been  minutes but its coming then i hear some of the servers talking about our orders the same gentleman then came to our table sat down next to me and told me that its only been  minutes and that they were working on our order and tried to give me some explanation about why thats not really a long time at all it was clearly almost half an hour or longer by that time the food finally arrived about  minutes after that but the food came cold we were so hungry by that point we just ate whatever we could neither angel nor anyone else came to top up our drinks even once i had to ask for mine but by that point i was in no mood to take a sip even i paid  and i again got the same gentleman who tried again to explain to me that it was just  minutes and that given everything we were within normal limits wow after about an hour and half at the restaurant we all just shook our heads and left i have written to them on their website and will see if they follow up we have vowed never to go to this restaurant again yikes|terrible wait staff  couldnt even seat us before we and another party walked out without even being greeted properly i observed several employees traipse out the front door several tables who were waiting for their food for a long time  several employees just standing around out of direct view of the tables a morbidly obese hostess that could barely physically walk from one end of the store to the other i think one server was high     going there was a  special request by a  year old getting over a longish illness so that makes the shabby treatment more enraging|food is good what youd expect from steak n shake the service is awful so incredibly awful expect to take at least an hour for your meal even when its slow ive been going here for years when i want a cheap meal but the service is so so so awful go to mcdonalds|the service was fast but the food was terrible and so was the service i had a bus to catch so i couldnt wait around waiting for the check so i went to the counter to pay she never brought my check never checked to see if my drink needed refilled she just mopped the floors the burger was really greasy the fries were luke warm and the cheese on them wasnt as flavorful as it should be as a new pittsburgher im not impressed|i should have known better than to stop here but i was nursing a hangover and just wanted something quick and simple  i should kick myself for thinking of this placegranted i decided to go to the drive thru and knew there would be a wait  the sign actually says that the food is prepared when you order it  i sat for almost ten minutes at the window while my food was prepared  during that time i wished i could have taken back my order and also wished that i hadnt paid already  while sitting at the window i decided to just stare inside and watch some of the employees doing their job  what disturbed me the most was watching the employee making the milkshakes  making a milkshake isnt that hard or glamorous of a thing to watch  what disgusted me was that the guy actually lifted several of the containers for the milkshakes and smelt them  i mean smelt them to see if they were clean instead of actually taking the extra minute or two to clean the container  after witnessing this my food was finally ready and i drove awaywhen i finally got to eating my food i was underwhelmed  the fries had no flavor and with the size of the cut it appears you get more than what you ordered  the steakburger really they should just call it a burger was overpowered by the bbq sauce on it  it was all i could tasteall this has cemented me in not wanting to ever step foot in one of these establishments ever again|you know what youre getting with a steak n shake its about one rung up from a mcds in quality and about two rungs down in quickness at least you think you know i used to have a small place in my heart though the salt and fat werent very kind to said organ for steak n shake because hey who can argue with beef and drinkable ice cream but after my last trip i can think of nothing more disgusting than having to eat here this location in particular i havent been back in over year and i will never step foot into a steak n shake as long as i have an immune system that i care about after having eaten here i hit the restroom on my way out along with my two friendshey were girls its acceptable one stall was already taken so two of us are stuck waiting while this occupant does hershall we say business after a few seconds we realize that shes not only there to relieve herself but to also take drivethrough orders yes thats rightyou want fries with that flush okay that will be  i have never ever witnessed anything so insane as a drivethrough restroom to top it off after finishing her bathroom break she walks straight out of the stall and into the restaurant i guess she was in too much of a rush to complete the order she had just taken that she didnt have time to wash her hands and i was in too much of a rush to choke back up what i had just eaten before it wreaked mayhem on my stomach|i love steak n shake this one however leaves a lot to be desired the food often comes out cold and the servers are apathetic at best most of the time theyre downright rude i highly recommend avoiding this location if possible theres one on route  thats worth the  minutes itll take you to get there|i like the occasional steak and shake stop    but this one has to be the slowest one ever    the cashier was rude and i could hear her yelling are you fucking kidding me because the register was not working the way she wanted     wow just wow|every time we come here the service is laughably bad on this visit a tabe which was sat after us had their food before our server graced us with her surly presence good restaurant elsewhere just avoid this location if you want to get your food inside an hour|wow dirty and slow  the floors felt like they had the days burger grease spilled all over and it took  mn to get our take out order|the staff is very rude at the drive thru to the point of telling me at  pm its only  you cant do the happy hour shakes yet   she literally screamed it at me   the management does not enforce any kind of health code in that restaurant either   i too have witnessed employees not washing hands and i have gotten food poisoning twice from undercooked burgers   once  shame on you twice  shame on me  wont go there again     the lovely occaisional drug deal out in the parking lot at night doesnt help either when you have kids|this location is terrible the drivethru workers are rude and they give you crap food i waited  minutes before being able to order even when there was only  car ahead of me then the lady proceeded to ask me if i would like anything on my burger and thinking the pictures on the menu are what theyre supposed to look like and they would never false advertise i asked doesnt it come with the fixings like in the picture she then told me it only comes with cheese so i then went on to tell her what i wanted on my burger pulled around and got my order pretty quick but later when i open my burger its just meat and cheese the meat is badly burned and cold it was clear to me this burger was not fresh i didnt even attempt to eat it what a waste of a place they definitely need better workers|awful in every category the service is the worst ive ever seen we were waiting to be seated in this half empty restaurant for  minutes before the manager came over and seated one couple then with more people waiting he went to the counter and took out a rag and started wiping it down we were still being ignore until i told him it was alright we didnt need a table and left i dont know how corporate keeps this place open ive complained numerous times but it never does any goodtake the extra  minutes to drive to the south hills location its pretty much the exact opposite of the waterfront the food comes out hot and properly cooked and you are not ignored by the staff|i really dont know how this place stays open ive been here a couple of times the service is slooooow they bring you your food which is never the way you ordered it put your bill on the table and never come back to check on you if the place was packed i could understand but its usually about half full on our last visit it took us  minutes to get our waitresses attention we asked for some mustard mayo lettuce and tomatoes for our burgers it took  minutes to get the mustard and mayo the lettuce and tomato never came its safe to say that we wont be back we like the food and shakes but not worth it to put up with the poor service|if could give toys cunt of a human being sue a manager negative  negative stars i would now i own a business so i understand management this stupid asshole from the second i walked in the door disrespected me  talked down to me then refused me service from the why do you wantwith accompanied eye roll  for no other reason than she was doin five peoples jobs i do five peoples jobs sometimes and thats no excuse for how she treated  and its treating me as i write this in front of her she just threw my receipt at me rang me out and threw my change in my hand then threw away my receipt so it would be harder for me to contact corporate i didnt pick her job if she hates it so bad being responsible for other ppl then maybe her smart fucking ass should pick a new career i will make it my lifes mission to get her fired for this because im pretty sure the camera dont lie middle finger|the hostess jenn of jess im not sure is atrocious i am autistic and asked to be moved from right beside the kitchen because of noise levels and she made a huge deal of it i ended up crying outside waiting for my partner to let me know wed been moved  minutes later we had still not been moved or gotten food and my partner and i left this is  pm on a thursday not at all busy just bad service our waitress was very polite though|i have eaten here before and never had any problems but today was completely different i arrived  pm to have lunch with my family we sat there for about  minutes and not one person came to ask us if we were ready to order they completely ignored us so we got up and left one table near us had to flag a waitress just to get her attention so we went to  wendys up on th avenue and we had no problems ar all|i know service speed isnt a chainwide issue this place is just really slow we ordered  minutes ago still no food|he was incredibly sexisthomophobic he could barely play the piano and when we finally recognized a song we could actually dance to he literally asked me to get off stage because he didnt like another on stage who could actually dance with the girls|entertainment great bartenders can be asses ordered  beers   jaegerbombs total was  second round of same with an asshole bartender was  then the third of the same was  what a damn ripoff|i didnt like the customer service of this body shop there price estimate for my repair was outrageous they wont be getting my business|ive gotten a few more estimates since i wrote my original review i found that joe dilorios repair estimate was three times the price of the other auto body shops if you dont believe me check yourself|when making a customers paymento atlowes we have our checklist do the phone numbers match  nope but thats fine since people are always changing their phone numbers anyways does the name on account match name on check  nope but mistakes happen at those pesky check companies does the account number on the check match the account number on the screen  why should it those computers are always making mistakesnow that we have verified that all the information is correct we can process the payment  the customer will be so happy that we didnt have to bother them with any silly questionsi am sad to say that this is an actual occurrence  what was originally an average lowes has turned into lowes hell  if the associates do not have basic logic comprehension how do they survive|would like to give no stars  bought all new kitchen appliances there  refrigerator is defective  theysend an outside company to repair  man arrives with no tools and wrong size seal for freezer  not once twice  the first time he tries to use my spoon from counter to install it  i complain too badthey have to comethree times before replacing it  never again|before today i probably would have given this place three stars based mostly on their beer selection however today the service was terrible we waited two hours for a pizza sub french onion soup fries and buffalo chicken tenders about an hour and a half in we finally got the small pizza sub and the wrongly made buffalo chicken tenders ie no hot sauce we were told by the waitress that she realized it was wrong but decided to still bring it out to see if my gf would eat it she sent it back by a half hour later we still had not received the buffalo chicken tenders nor the french onion soup which should have been mostly made already and no fries  we were told the chef was new but no effort was made really to make the situation better no quick and easy app or beers on the house to boot the beer was pretty expensive i will probably give the place another chance based on their beer selection but it wont be for a while the food has always been average at best and the pizza sub was no different we ended up leaving after two hours without receiving  of our order|the food was absolutely gross i ordered a turkey club which comes on a wheat bun with avocado bacon and turkey breast what i got was totally different from the picture first of all the sandwich was on sliced bread lame there was no avocado  slice of bacon no lettuce and to top it off instead of turkey breast they used freaking lunch meat lol no not the kind that you get from the deli the other sweaty nasty looking stuff gross our waitress was awful but they were extremely understaffed so i would have a bit of an attitude if i had to wait  tables without assistance too   the manager was really nice of course that disgusting sandwich that i didnt eat was free|mediocre service cold food our food waited so long the lettuce  pickles wilted bland food crazy overpriced long waits in the arcade  beer per hour maximum  avoid at all costs fair manager|this place just plain sucksbad management lost them bizdumb arcade drama they have recently changed their under  policy so no one underage can even be in the arcade or restaurant after pm despite having a guardian over  years old|visited the dave and busters in homestead pa last night waitress mixed up our credit cards and gave my brothers credit card to someone else and he theirs charged them already too  both incorrectly my brother had to walk around and find out who it was waitress never apologized gm was extremely rude and refused to give my brother his original receipt back saying they had thrown it out did nothing to remedy the situation and ignored us the rest of our visit  not even a refill after spending over  plus games we will never go back whatever happened to the customer is always right horrible service|most of the games were out of order and i had to find one of those referee looking people to fix  of them that took some of our credits  apathetic service staff all around the peanut and i were really disappointed  wont be back|to keep it short and sweet save yourself  buy a good board game your alcohol of choice order a pizza and invite your friends over what an incredible disappointment after seeing the enticing commercials so many times we decided to give this place a try on a double date i understand the prices of the play cards and wont dispute them however the food was incredibly overpriced came out cold as in sat on a counter without warmers for a minimum of  minutes and i literally had to ask the bartender if there was any vodka in my drink it was pure juice  for three shots that had littleno alcohol in them not to mention my glass was dirty and i saw the bartender scoop the glass into the ice basin because she was too lazy to use the sanitary scoop i know the food and beverage commission would be as disappointed as i was the service was terrible dont ask for anything from your waiter as they are a little too busy on their cell phones or conversing amongst themselves was it fun to be in an adultthemed arcade yes if youre looking for a good atmosphere to go with friends to play games i suppose i would advise you give it a shot i would never recommend their food customer service or drinks save yourself the money and stay home or go for a traditional bowling figure skating rollerblading rock climbing basically any other physicallyentertaining themed date instead|i was here on  and i have to say this was a horrible experience  me and a friend went here to eat and play a couple games afterwards  it took the waitress at least  minutes to greet us and by that time we knew we should just order then because we might not see her again  we ordered and got our drinks and well lets just say we didnt see the waitress again until she was giving us our check some manager delivered the food to the table  no refill on my beverage no how is your food no ketchup for my burger or fries was offered  lots of people running around like crazy and if your understaffed hire more people  i will not be back again to eat|we checked in at  pm on a saturday with a group of  for a birthday gathering  we were originally told  pm is when wed be seated but thats not the problem because we were able to play before being seated  we actually didnt get seated until  pm only to be told the kitchen was taking  hours for peoples orders  didnt see a manager until after  pm  needless to say we didnt stay to eat and went elsewhere|ok we went on a sat night with a large party  hour wait for a table fine thats understand then it turned to a three hour wait once seated we were told the kitchen was three hours behind and the wait for food would be three hours the manger blamed us saying  you came with a large party on a sat night if you only order apps and not separate  meals you might get food in  min really  its the customers fault your staff cant handle a sat night rush the table of  next to us waited  hours for food when they got it it was the wrong food i will never spend money here againto top it off the bathroom had no toilet paper and there was pee everywhere|awful awful spent service was terrible took  minutes to even be acknowledged really the only saving grace was the kids had fun and the hostess took amazing care of us|the service at the pittsburgh location was so incredible awful that i actually took the time out of my day to write online how disappointed i was which i have never done before it was a saturday night and as someone who works in a restaurant im very sympathetic when it comes to service we sat at the high tables in the bar area and we did not get greeted or even acknowledged for  minutes i personally had to get a manager and explain to him the situation and he treated me like i was stupid maybe because im  also not to mention the little girl next to me is balling her eyes out because she told her server of an egg allergy she has and they still managed to mess it up and give her food marinated in egg last i overhead they are heading to the hospital im not writing this message to be spiteful im writing it in hopes that the future of your restaurant will improve theres a big difference between service and hospitality and right now this place is lacking both my best wishing for improvement|worst experience at a restaurant waited  minutes for a waitress to come over and tell us that they changed a rule and that to eat in the game room you needed to be with someone over  when we had eaten there  days prior without any problems when  of us are legally adults will never go back to this place i highly recommend red robin across the street|this wasnt the cleanest place dirty paper towels all over the womens bathroom no changing covers on the changing tables to change your babies very disappointed when i came here compared to the other two ive been too also they arent following corporate policy which ok but when i asked about it to one of the managers on the way out he said he didnt honor the first responders discount like the other stores do which ok is fine but he had a very sore attitude towards them very disappointed in his attitude more then anything|worst service ive ever had we waited for over an hour for our food after the waitress walked by  times without saying a word or refilling our drinks we got a manager who had her come by and apologize and give us a round but never said a word about our food and told us her help never showed up we waited another  mins for our food before we asked for the check for the  drinks we got we left and nothing was even said about why we never got our food no apologies nothing while sitting there we noticed  other parties walked out as well they didnt even get their drinksi would recommend that if you go there never sit and eat drink play games fine i will never order food there again|went to dave and busters to eat no food went to dave and busters to play no games then i thought id wet my whistle with a cool glass of hothey even ran out of water some lady even yelled at me in line to purchase game tickets accusing me of cutting line such hostility dave and busters more like beavis  butthead smh|this is a place id go to just for the games the food was bad i had the chicken sliders and there was two pieces of wood in the sandwich which i found in my mouth granted the manager did take off the price of the sliders but everyones fries were lukewarm my sister got the chicken fingers and wow there was zero flavor or seasoning on it the bathrooms smelled like stale urine and the floors were very sticky the waitress was nice but overall i wouldnt dine here again|this is the wendys that made me never want to eat at wendys ever again  to think i gave it a second a third and even a fourth try  i guess convenience gets dollars but after so long youll stop getting minethe employees here are always fighting when you go in about shift changed and duties and the attitude carries itself right over to the register  the management isnt any better telling me to go somewhere else if i dont like it then  this place is the reason people scoff at giving  a hr to fast food employees  the frosty is never frosty always runny  the burgers are slapped together and the dining room looks more like a daycare after a long day than a place you would want to sit down and eatthe only good thing about this place is the exit so you can swiftly leave and never come back|tried going twice twice i got a  were closed i said i thought you were open till  nah it was  i thought wendys advertises that theyre open until  like thats their commercial campaign guess not cant rate the food cause i havent received any i would have loved to try but since its  guess they are closed dont worry wendys maybe you should add  sodas to this location but dont worry i wont have any from this one or any i am done w this franchise|it took an hour to get our food when everyone else got their food in five minutes they forgot two of our drinks and one of the employees said a cuss word infront of a child|if there was a way to give no stars i would horrible service was given a time frame or min for delivery after waiting an hour we called and was told food was on the way they sent the delivery guy out with  orders after another min we called back and was told pizza was still there because they ran out of part of our order they said theyd bring it right away waited another min we live about  miles away from the place still nothing so we called back and asked for our money back they never once apologized and every phone call they were trying to talk to another person about a whole different matter and oh since we used a card its going to be  days to see the refund at least pay cash so when they dont show you know you wont be ripped off at least|if you want terrible pizza go here save money go buy a frozen pizza and it will be better than this place|horrible beer horrible service horrible menu|my friends got everyhing from steakthey didnt even get a well done steak right to mahi tacos and the only great menu item was the seasoned vegetables give it a miss sing sing next door is awesome but get dinner somewere else after we were done the waiter asked if we were ready for the checks and i had ordered meal that came with a desert really dissapointing all around|for a brewery who is attempting to take advantage of oktoberfest you wonder how at  pm they could be out of mashed potatoes  sauerkraut then a sausage platter with sweet mustard guess they have not been to germany not worth  unfortunately the sausage platter was |came with my bf we started with the crab artichoke dip it was very greasy and had virtually no crab the wedge salad was good and crisp i had the hazelnut crusted chicken this has to be one of the worst dishes ive ever had it was like pancake syrup over breaded chicken to finish the meal we had the homemade chocolate chip cookies served with hot fudge well there was no hot fudge it was chocolate syrup the ice cream was so crystallized from melting and refreezing all around disappointing|be careful the servers cant pay attention to save their lives and the management cares even less i want to make sure people know how careless the management is particularly mark who seems to let his staff run around|very disappointing menu pseudo mexican and south of the border fare i had the beef tip sliders what a ridicules offering each one  on a plate had a nickel sized piece of beef on an oblong   bun it was taken back to the kitchen after i complained and a thin sliver now appeared the only thing good about this experience the waiter was niceas the raven said never never more|terrible customer service disrespectful in fact i towed my vehicle to master muffler in the evening the owner called me at  am the next day and gave me attitude for leaving it in his parking lot he told me he wouldnt work on the vehicle and that i had to pick it back up by the end of the day i said this was a secondary vehicle and i asked if he could be fixed at his earliest convenience he said it doesnt work like that  never going back again  and i would advise against master muffler to all others|went to see bret ernst one of my fave comedians  tickets say seating begins at pm for the pm show  well a line had formed outside because they hadnt opened the doors  that is all well and good if it is summertime but it was  degrees  people stood out there upwards of  minutes freezing  they didnt let people in because they claimed the room was not ready  seating is first come first served  whoever designed this place should be shot  there is no lobby to hold people before a show  the improv in cleveland is superb  that location has a huge lobby and bar where you can mingle before the show and they have ushers seat you  the pittsburgh improv is a disaster layoutwise  beverage service was fine  it got really really warm in the room and even the comedian was sweating like a freak show  of course bret and bill crawford were as hilarious as ever but man this improv as a comedy venue sucks|in the market for unsalted cashews how about oyster sauce ahhh heres an easy one bean sproutswell if you are keep a crystal ball and rabbits foot handy if youre planning on shopping at this giant eagle because youll need both a soothsaying ability as well as a fair share of luck on your quest at this dive for a store of this size they are frequently out of stock on items as common as jalapeo peppers to specialty foods items like flat rice noodles maybe im the only person in homestead buying these itemswait that doesnt make sense theyd be in stock if i weredo yourself a favor and either go to the greenfield regent square or kennywood giant eagles all three stores are much smaller but seem to stock rare items like unsalted or as of late sea salted xochitl tortilla chips and honey nut cheerios|this review is specifically for the dfs cleaners at this giant eagle location  i dropped clothing off for the sake of convenience once i really should have known better  never again  my items came back completely covered in lint  i could let this slide however my pencil skirt was safety pinned to the hanger  the weight of the skirt caused even larger holes than what were placed there by the pins  being that its a pencil skirt designed to have a blouse tucked in theres no way that i can wear it again  this was an expensive skirt completely ruined  very disappointed  again this review is just for the dry cleaners  the rest of the store is actually better than a lot of other ges ive been to in pittsburgh  just dont take your dry cleaning here|this is a review of the pharmacy after having them screw up a third time i felt that others should know that this is a pharmacy to avoid the first time they misread a prescription and gave me the wrong dose of synthroid about th of what i needed i ended up so sick after  weeks of taking too little that i was half dead before the problem was caught their response when i told them was to say oops and it wont happen again not even a sorry and it never did happen again bc i went to costco after that this latest time was classic i came with a simple scrip costco was closed so i went to giant eagle after  minutes the finally inform me that they cant fill it bc the scrip isnt specific enough it was for a common antibiotic nothing complicated they didnt bother to call me earlier or tell me sooner just made me wait and wait and wait until i pitched a fit to tell me that they couldnt fill it it was late and i went to rite aid in sq hill with the same exact scrip and they had zero issues filling it quickly wtf how can it be easy peasy at rite aid but giant eagle cant even muster the effort to tell me that they are too incompetent to fill it out i wonder if there is even a legit pharmacist working there at all it seems like they arent even staffing the pharmacy with trained techs just random people off of the street dont waste your time or risk your health go to any other pharmacy in town avoid giant eagle|went to barnes and noble waterfront with  books on my list       first one there were several books by the same name so they wanted the name of the author  went to look it up on my phonebarnes and noble wifi had blocked me  wanted me to sign it and allow them access to my informationnot  long story short they only had one of the  books i was looking for and it was  less on amazonlost this customer|the words epic fail get thrown around a lot these daysbut i really feel like they apply in this situationwe went on friday april  and arrived at pm  it was busy but not crowdedno waiting for a table  half price apps and drinks  we ordered at the food just appetizers mind you didnt arrive till almost pm  drinks were ordered and were unbelievably slow  we placed one order for  draft beers at they arrived at    minutes for beerby  we were canceling food orders which wed given up on after waiting almost an hour  we just wanted to leaveinstead of comping anything they added  gratuity to each of our bills  uhhhh yeah  thanks for giving me one more reason never to come back   we finally were able to leave around bar louie  you are dead to me|we were going to see a movie that started at pm the  of us got to bar louie at   we sat outside and it was nearly  minutes before the waiter even stopped to get our order  i tried stopping a waitress but was told this isnt my table  finally the waiter took our order   sam adams light bottle and one pineapple juicevodka  after about minutes another waiter maybe the manager i dont know asked if we had been waited on we said yes and told him we had been waiting  he left and another different waitress came to bring us our drinks they were wrong my date was given vodka on the rocks and i was given a sam adams they took these back and another  minutes before the correct order was served we told them to bring another round and the check  it was  minutes before they returned and they forgot the checkby this time we had to go to be on time for the movie my date asked for the check again so we could leave finally they brought it and i gave him my card when he came back we signed it and left in a hurry to catch the moviefor  bottle beers and  pineapple juice  vodka i was charged  i didnt have time to complain or ask i wont be going back|when the ratio to wait staff to diners is  youd think you could get servicenothing erks me more then seeing idol wait staff and hungry patrons i very rarely walk out of a restaurant with out having eaten first i came here on saturday ay pm almost none of the diners had food on their table and many of them didnt have drinks in the  minutes i was there i counted  waitress again i counted  waitresses and not a one of them came over to our table to get even a drink order just from the looks of it i could tell staying any longer would be a total train wreck so after  minutes of waitress counting we left with empty bellies|i was looking to get out of the apartment on a really nice sunny day and we decided to drive to waterfront and walk around all around great day until we hit bar louie for some drinks and appetizersi am giving it one star though it deserves none because our waitress was nice if a bit inattentive and the hummus app we ordered was pretty damn good outside of that bar louie leaves a lot to be desiredthis is probably the first place ive been to where they charge  and up for all mixed drinks to me that is beyond ridiculous bar louie is not an upscale restaurant as much as they wish they were and paying almost  for three drinks and two appetizers is insanity defined as i mentioned the waitress was friendly but she definitely did not come back and check on us enough i really wanted to like this place because of things i had heard and the drinks we had were really damn good but if it want to spend that kind of money ill go somewhere that i can get good service|i came here last night to get a few appetizers before a movie and was hoping to be able to write a review on the food unfortunately i cannot because the service was so bad that i left before i had the chance to order we found seats at the bar behind the taps after sitting there for  minutes and not being acknowledged we thought that they might not be able to see us and so we moved to a different pair of seats in the middle of the bar grabbing a few menus on the way so we would be ready to order it was fairly busy but it is not like there were people standing at the bar trying to get drinks  everyone was seated and im sure they face much busier times we sat in our new seats for almost  minutes i timed it  i am not exaggerating and were not even acknowledged you would at least think the bartender would acknowledge us and tell us he would be with us when he could but despite staring him down almost the whole time we could not even make eye contact i hope this is a fluke but will probably not be back to find out|the absolute worst service i have ever had at any bar or restaraunt  and in looking at other reviews i am not the first  there are many options at the waterfront and i would suggest you try any of them but stay far away from this place|servers are chatting not paying attention to tables i can see my salad is ready at the window worst serves ever|meh i just dont see the appeal bar louis has to pittsburghers i guess this particular restaurant benefits from people who work at the waterfront stopping in after a shift its always packed being so close to the amc theater they get traffic before and after movies its expensive the food is so so before i get ahead of myself i had the bbq ranch chicken salad without chicken the bbq ranch dressing was very good but its very easy to duplicate at home its equal parts ranch dressing and kc masterpiece hickory bbq sauce and a drop or two of worcestershire and a drop of franks hot sauce tuesday is dollar burgers  until midnight daily drink and happy hour selections but even thats not enough to get me here skip it one caveat for this location free parking at station squares location you gotta pay to park the jalopyim eager to see if this place sees a huge drop in business when burgatory opens across the street|we stopped here to enjoy a drink before our movie our server was friendly my husband had a margarita and my server suggested a berry mojito to meboth drinks were overly sweet and barely any alcohol  after i finished my drink i used my fork to dig for the blackberries at the bottom only to find to my disgust a decent sized piece of clear saran wrap ugg did they muddle the mint into the saran wrap she comped the drink but we wont be backcant speak about the food since we didnt have any but atmosphere was loud and it was difficult to have a conversation without repeating yourself|i cant even review this place we sat ourselves and waited for a waitress to take our order and we waited and waited until we got tired and just left and i have to be clear it was a saturday afternoon maybe like  tables with people at them and i saw  waitress walking around i think its probably a bad idea to ignore people that come into your restaurant especially since burgatory just opened across the street|well its pm on a tuesday and no tater tots dip for the chips are cold and beer is room temperature not very happy will try the station square bar louie next time|my friends and i went down to the waterfront to enjoy some shopping and have dinner everywhere was pretty busy so when we went into bar louie we were not upset it took at least ten minutes for a server to come to our table he immediately brought our waters over and we ordered drinks only another  minutes until he brought one martini over we ordered our food and after talking to management it still took  minutes and our order was messed up we tried to be understanding when we learned it was only our servers first day but you would think that management would try to help the poor guy out he didnt get out of the weeds for the  hours we were there very disappointing and embarrassing on managements part we werent the only people having horrible service because when we looked around the bar everyone was upset i hope they will let the server get some more experience rather than feeding him to the wolves on the second day|sign stated seat yourself so we should have know the service would be horrible from the moment we walked in  we originally sat upstairs which was open per the sign  after  minutes we got up and went outside after  minutes outside and after the waitress taking care of and making small talk with the table next to us we said screw it and walked  the one other time that i had been there the service was soso  i will never go back  why should i have to try to track people down to pay for a meal|should have checked the reviews before we went ive been to real bar louies in other cities this is not one of them was seated for  min and no wait staff came to take our order several of them made eye contact but did not feel the need to ask if we had been waited on awkward then someone came over with two plates of food trying to serve us we thought here was our big chance to get served but no she just walked away so we left there are so many restaurants where you can get burgers just go someplace else|worst bar i have ever been to they used maybe no alchohol in their drinks and consistency had no meaning here we ordered three berry mojitos and they were different significantly i posted a picture you judge|the worst bar and the worst service in the area if i could give it  stars i would there is not one positive thing i could say about any times ive ever been here it has now been added to my very short list of places i will never step foot in again please take your hard earned money elsewhere|i went with some work friends before catching a movie later that night  we got to bar louie a little over  hours before the movie started which left us with hardly any time to spare by the time we were done  we had a table right away and the server took drink orders but it took  minutes to get our drinks  she then disappeared for  minutes before coming back to take a food order  the food took almost an hour and we had only ordered a couple appetizers  the portions were really small for the price and most of the food came out burnt  i did not risk mentioning it at the thought of waiting another hour for new food  again waiting for the server to bring the checks after the meal was an ordeal in itself and took much longer than it should have  the place was busy but not overcrowded what i would expect on a typical weeknight  there is no excuse for the poor service and food  on top of that the restrooms were extremely filthy and clearly had not been stocked or cleaned recently  maybe it was just an off night for this place but i do not plan on going back again and taking that chance|dont waste your time with this place  long lines overpriced and no shade or cooling spots while you wait half the rides were shut down youre better off with a garden hose save your money or buddy up to someone with a pool|insanely expensive  parking  locker  wrinkled burnt hot dog i really hate this place kids received season passes for christmas present brought kids once and will never return spent  on food and threw most of it away|boo  what happened to this location  it used to be happy and fun  it just feels depressing and nearly everyone there is just doing the bare minimum to get by  so sad|came here the other day for a late lunch with a friend the place was pretty dead and we were seated right away took  minutes for our waiter to show up and we just order both drinks and food then took another  minutes to just get our drinks  beers on draft and tables who were seated after us were served much faster then us finally our food came soup salad boneless wings and fries a different server delivered the food and it looked like it had been sitting out for awhile after being given our food we were completely ignored along with others in our section us and two other tables waited over  minutes just to try and ask for our check one table just got up and left being a server myself i try to be very understanding to the wait staff but this was ridiculous the restaurant was not even close to busy and my section of about  tables was ignored|awful everything from the bad service to the diluted soup to the lameno chicken on the chicken salad to the prefabricated pizza avoid this place|well it started well food was okay deep dish pizza was good but the salad we had  too tiny portionwe were greeted and seated well but later the service was not all good bad bad service first of all we had to ask for everything we wanted the server didnt even had courtesy to ask if we wanted anything more or would like to go for deserts she just handed over the check when we even didnt ask for it we wanted to order morelater when we talked about this in the front the girl there also just listened and said okay not even a sorry oncei would not like to go there again |how does this place still exist of every place on the waterfront  i wont lie i do like their lobster bisque but every time ive gone its just over priced average quality with semi ok serviceskip this place all together and get pizza at pizza company and take it home|possibly the worst overpriced pizza there is  nearly  for a pepperoni pizza for two would be okay if it were good   crust is extremely dry and unflavorfulif you want a good deep dish pizza try burghs pizza and wing pub in bridgeville   their deep dish is thicker tastier crust better sauce and a lot more cheesetoppings   cheaper tooservice was just barely adequate on this visit|interesting the reviews here are less than stellar already i would normally not review a chain retail store but the service i received today just really got my blood boilingi will state as i always do in these types of situations that i have worked many years in retail i know what youre supposed to do i know the ways ive displayed exemplary service and i know the ways ive slacked off i get it i really doso im in the store early hardly any people in there weird for the semiannual sale time of year usually it doesnt matter what time youre there during the sale its always busy i went through my usual bins and picked up a mess of undies and bras since no one was at the check out counter and i needed a spot to go through things i set them down and started to try and chat with the sales chick i actually always like to do this just to shoot the breeze but also to get their opinions on items im buying the girl behind the counter was having non of this thoughi asked her about a bra and she said she didnt know about that one but said it should work i understand you cant try them all but the thing that really irked me was that she was definitely not hiding her annoyance at me setting down my things on the counter i even looked back to make sure there were no people checking out behind me ghost town tumbleweed rolled by no oneso im going through my stuff and separating what i want and dont want and shes sighing and grabbing things saying soooo you dont want these um im not asking you to help me sort things im not holding up a line im just trying to not spend  on an accidental xs pair of undies that got mixed in after that its not exactly what she said but how she acted i have never felt more uncomfortable in a retail store before i ended up grabbing my discards and putting them back myself which i really dont mind doing but after she huffed and puffed i didnt even want to deal with her the thing is i was nice the entire time i dont expect you to sit there and be sugary sweet either just do what you were hired to do be nice and sell some bras if you come to work in a bad mood the real world is not going to give you a hug suck it up and do your job or work where you dont have to talk to anyone else ever|i hate this placeits very loud the service is very poor and the food is sosoif you want good chinese in pittsburgh try china palace shadyside or sesame inn station square or north hills  theyre quieter with very good food  service|honestly im furious i enjoyed pf changs restaurants in the chicago area and my wife and i have eaten a few times at this pittsburgharea location over the last year we have tried repeatedly but the  minute wait for dinner is unacceptable we tried going early late  it never made any difference the front staff was rude and the wait was too longtonight we had a special date planned and made reservations a week in advance we came in the door exactly on time waited in the line to see the front staff and we were promptly handed a pager they couldnt tell us when we would be seatedi imagined a short wait so we went outside crossed into a store to wait since the entrance of this location is so packed its impossible to wait at the bar or in the meager seatingafter  minutes we gave up we went back to pf changs and the front office staff still couldnt tell us when we would be seated i saw open tableswhat on earth is the point of accepting reservations if you do not honor themthe food here is good but certainly not great we went to a local thai place and were seated with no problem in  minutes the food was much better the service was good even in a crowded busy restaurant oh and the local place was a much more reasonable pricewe certainly will never visit pf changs again|this was my first time at this pf changs and i was not impressed the service was extremely slow even though it was a sunday night and the restaurant was not very busy the portions were small they were also playing  year old pop music really loud pop music come onthis is an asian bistro|rude unwelcoming short haired black hostess drinks were not good greasy spring  rolls below par on every way  no experience needed to work here|walked in tonight wednesday at  the place was empty asked for a table the hostess told us one moment when she finds one for us then proceeded to walk to a dirty table and clean it  the phone rang and she answered it as we stood at the door when she hung up the phone she walked back to the table and proceeded to clean it again  didnt say a word to us unbelievable  will not be back there rude hostess|we went last night saturday night to pfchang located at the kierlands in scottsdale terrible experience after waiting over one hour to be seated we ordered calamari for appetizer which came with a horrible strange salty sauce and salt and pepper mix on the side then i ordered beef and broccoli and my husband ordered a vegetarian dish with peanut sauce  after a long wait my food came so salty that i could not even eat and as much as i hate to complain but i had to let the waiter know so he went to get me one with less salt my husbands dish was ok then the second one was a bit less salty but the meat had a terrible liver kind of taste which totally turned my stomach i feel the reason they added so much salt was to hide the bad tasting rotted meat very bad experience our waiter was kind and sympathetic ruined my evening out |let me start off by saying i have mostly simple tastes and my favorite lunch spot for chinese has been the new dumpling house in squirrel hill but since that restaurant is undergoing renovations i was forced to try something newso i thought id try the chain pf changs chinese restaurant at the waterfront wow what an unsatisfying mistake that turned out to bei started with a cup of their wonton soup at  it wasnt too outrageous of a price the broth had some flavor and there was much more in it than i was used to including three giant basil i think leafs that covered everything beneath in the broth were chunks of chicken two shrimp some sliced water chestnuts and two porkfilled wontons as i said the broth had decent flavor but the wontons were thick doughy and undercooked and the chicken chunks were dry which is amazing since they were drowned in broth on a scale of bad to good it was kind of mehnext came my lunchportion order of changs kung pao chicken the dinner portion is  more at the new dumpling house this dish is served with a delectable dark rich tangy sauce which i was really hoping for not at pf changs on my plate i received about  quartersize chunks of lightly breaded and browned chicken  hot chinese red chili peppers mostly inedible unless they are diced into a sauce a handful of blanched unsalted peanuts a few sliced scallions and a bed of the most bland brown rice i have ever encountered uncle ben wouldve been ashamed if that stuff came out of one of his boxesglaringly there was no sauce none at allive had kung pao chicken in new york city san francisco and even from a hole in the wall in bethel park pa that was much much better never have i had it served in such a bland skimpy and overpriced way the lunchportion cost was at the new dumpling house i could have a delicious lunch with soup entree and complimentary hot tea and i could leave satisfied with just  outofpocket  and that includes the tipthe service was decent however lesson learned one and done never going back to pf changs|the only thing this place has going for itself is the decor the food is very americanized and not true at all of what real chinese good should look or taste like and the hosthostess think their doing us a favor by seating us|dumb dumber and dumbest are running the hostess stand they gave me  different estimates on the wait time none of which was accurate john tapper is needed on this property|i went with my family late at night the food was not good at all  it looked like the left over  i hate itthe service was not that professional|we hadnt been at pf changs for awhile and now i remember whythe service was terrible the silverware was dirty we waited almost  minutes for water glasses to be brought to the table the waiter forget several things we asked for and above all the food was tasteless and the portion sizes smaller than lunch sized portions we were there before the dinner crowd started so the lack of service or food quality cant be blamed on a busy time dont think we will be going back there|i was a little peeved that the gluten free version of the buddha feast cost  when the regular version cost  so youre charging a dollar more to give me the glutenfree version of a veggie tofu and rice platter regardless its worth it to get the glutenfree soy sauce which i buy for myself and i know isnt that expensive when my dish comes out its literally just steamed veggies and rice no tofu no seasoning or sauce i ask why theres no tofu and the response is that the tofu has gluten in it when i ask if there should be any sauce aka flavor to the dish im informed i couldve ordered any other glutenfree dishs sauce to go along with it thanks for the info nowyes ill take the gf beef broccoli sauce on the side the sauce comes out and its actually tasty so my food was finally interesting enough to eat even though now im extra annoyed at paying  for steamed veggies and rice and why the menu made no mention that you wouldnt get flavor or tofu to top it all off based on how miserable i feel now im pretty sure the beef broccoli sauce they brought out contained gluten anyway so i paid more got less and still got gluten in my food not a happy customer not going back not going to recommend it to anyone|went there today to have my birthday lunch it was about  so the place was not crowded at all got seated not far from the hostess station and sat for close to  mins without anyone coming to the table no water nothing the table next to us who got seated after us had a server and water by the time we left got up to leave and the hostess said is everything ok i said no no one ever came overand we went to bravo and had a great lunch i like pf changs in general but if the  hostesses watched us sit there for  mins i have no idea why they didnt do something i wont be going back here anytime soon|my daughter and i went to panera waterfront homestead pa around  pm on a saturday and tried to order a dozed bagels  we inquired as to when more asiago bagels would be available and the counter person responded with we wont be making more bagels  thats all we have  thinking maybe this was a mistake i tried calling in for a dozen bagels at  pm on saturday a couple weeks later and was told the same thing that panera  a neighborhood bakery was out of french toast bagels at  pm and wont be making any more  i find it interesting they have many employees standing around i could see if they were busy but they arent busy and items are in the oven baking and with several hours left open for business they easily deny customers product they want to purchase surely it doesnt take very long to bake  bagels when given a couple hours  maybe they should not be so concerned about the leftovers being donated instead they should focus on customers reasonable request|non existent internet service   i came here to do some work on my laptop and the internet speed wasnt strong enough  |stopped by sunday morning the light roast coffee was cold i ordered a steak  egg breakfast sandwich the steak was ice cold the slice of tomato that i had them add was not ripe panera quality should be consistent no matter what location you visit very disappointing considering their pricing structure|i shop at target on a regular basis and usually have no problems  my holiday shopping included stocking stuffers and i bought  of you  dvd  when i tried to return one dvd out of everything i purchased a single  dvd i forgot my receipt we were give  back when i asked donna the counter person why only  she said that we can only give the current sale price without a receipt that makes sense i thought accept the current price was   i pointed to the movies that were clearly marked  and she said i dont know what the policy is or why you only get  back  one dollar   great customer service donna at target|we rented tuxedos for a wedding had to go down twice for fittings they we still wrong everyones tuxedos were to big the pants were falling off everyone the staff was not helpful in any way the walk away from you and dont come back the worst tux ive ever rented you think if u pay  for a tuxit should fit you take my advise if your going to rent a tux dont go to the mens warehouse in the water front|lets start this review by saying that when we are at that point my girlfriend and i will be going to jos a bank for mine and my groomsmans suits  allow me to give you a numbered breakdown of the issues we encountered when renting from mens wearhouse to be the groomsmen in our friends wedding they never contacted us after the fitting after saying there would be a followup call  the other groomsmen and i had to follow up repeatedly to get an answer as to when our tuxedos would arrive and the staff were very short with our honest questions over the phone they sent two of our tuxedos to homestead when we asked for them to be sent to ross park mall during the fitting when one of us called two days prior to the wedding to ask if our tuxs had arrived the guy answering the phone said oh i dont know insert an awkward pregnant pause here while waiting for him to say let me check that for you he instead said well im going to hang up now  and he made good on that promise and hung up despite saying wed get a call a few weeks ahead of the wedding to be resized in case one of us gained a few lbs over the winter this call never came so we basically had to hope that everything fit as it needed to we were at one point informed that mw had our emails on file and that when our tuxes arrived at the store we would receive an email letting us know  not a single groomsman received any such email to that effect one of the groomsmen randomly received a black tie while everybody else had white  another received no studs  we discovered this approximately two hours to showtime while relatively far from civilization on picking up my tux i informed the associate ill be unable to get to a mens wearhouse for a few days after the wedding is this alright to which she responded yeah that should be fine so when my girlfriend graciously dropped off my tux for me a few days later and learned of the  late fee i was totally caught off guard my girlfriend was also caught totally off guard by the associate at ross park mall who was incredibly rude to her when  he informed her of said late fee as the best man i was given a coupon card for  off my next rental at mens wearhouse  since i am in another wedding next month with rentals from mw i figured this would be an opportune time to use it  imagine my shock while paying for the next weddings rental when i presented the coupon and was told oh that isnt for this  that is intended for your wedding  oh and it expires on december st of this year  the groom himself decided to use a coupon to purchase a suit for the wedding and to own rather than rent a tux for the occasion  he was ensured by the homestead staff that the coupon would be fine for this purpose and got fitted for it  when he went to pick up his suit and pay with the aid of said approved coupon he was instead forced into an argument with an associate who insisted he could not use the coupon towards the suit that an associate a few weeks earlier had insisted he could use  granted now i am speaking for another person so take that with as much salt as you may but he reiterated this fact to me several times prior to his wedding last weekover my friends wedding weekend any time anything even went slightly wrong at and around his wedding the joke between the groom and his groomsmen was effing mens wearhouse  for example at a restaurant wait i asked for no onions on this sandwich  effing mens wearhouse  noise complaint at the hotel room mens wearhouseanother groomsman looked at me when we discovered the wrong color tie one of us received and said to me i hope youre taking notes for your own impending wedding to which i replied perhaps i could find better service from goodwill of western pacongrats mens wearhouse  you became the butt of every joke for every mishap for an entire weekend around a wedding to which you provided the suitstldr   mistakes several rude associates and  future groom going to jos a bank|let me start out by saying that my husband loves the mw at westmoreland mall and even rented his tux there for our wedding without issue last year he also rented a tux there for an outoftown wedding he was in after the wedding was over the next day before we returned home we returned the tux to a mw at the local mall also sans any issuesrecently said husband got a promotion and bought some dress pants and shirts from mw at the mall and was sent a  gift card last weekend we decided to head down to the waterfrontlo and behold theres a mw in homestead who knew so we head to mw to see if he can get something for free before we go in i ask him how much are pants normally at mw he said oh about  or  okay well the cheapest pair of pants we find are around  but most around  im shocked never thought mens dress clothes were so pricey again who knew surprisingly we were able to sift through the sale racks and were able to find one pair of pants on sale for  and dress shirts for  very exciting the problem was the staff and the store itself first of all the store was messy sales racks had clothes out of place and shirts rolled up not a good impression for a high end mens clothing store not to mention it was hard to look for sizes etc with everything out of placethe biggest issue was with the staff there were five employees in the store okay i get it they work on commission but seriously the one and only employee who approached us and i cant remember her name but she was a middleaged russian woman was a shark she asked if we need help we both say no were fine just looking i am much more assertive than my husband however which she realized right away needless to say she wouldnt leave us alone i tried several times  nicely  to tell her we were just looking around my husband said im looking for some dress shirts and pants maybe a tie she just doesnt get itkeeps asking do you want to look at more ties we have nice blazers and jackets im finally like lady were only here because we have a gift card we dont plan on spending a ton of money getting her to leave us alone was near impossible if it would have been me alone i would have walked out however i knew my husband wanted to use the gift cardthe worst part is there were other customers in the store that no one was waiting on some of which were looking around for assistance i didnt get itcontinuing on check out was a nightmare each and every item rang up more than the price tag she had to end up cancelling the sale and redoing the whole thing we had to carefully scrutinize every thing she rang up to make sure we werent overcharged we ended up going over the   obviously so she says you can swipe your card there i said we have cash and omg you would have thought it was the end of the world they had no money in the drawer and she actually had to send another employee in the back to get us change lets just say im sure my hub wont returning here anytime soon you can buy nice mens clothing almost anywhere else for less money and less hassle pros none|this store has such bad service the service staff are rude rude rude  save your money shop elsewhere|i love bbb however this location is terrible it is rare that i find an employee that actually helps you voluntarily i feel that everyone hates their jobs especially the manager davina i work at a more upscale retail store and i feel it is my responsibility to genuinely welcome smile greet and service our clients maybe im reaching too high with bbb i feel they expect you to greet them and make them feel comfortable i never could understand this mentality maybe they should pay me for this responsibility|we had the worst possible experience at the eat n park at waterfront on  at around pm our waitress annemarie was inattentive and got us the wrong order we ended up with a dish we had not even ordered and still got charged for it on the check one of my friends ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich which according to the menu description shouldve had lettuce and tomato in it but the sandwich that arrived on our table had none of those ingredients when pointed out to the waitress she just brought some lettuce and tomatoes in a plate how crude spoke to the manager after paying the full check and first of all she did not even offer to reimburse for the item we did not even order and that had been forcibly thrust upon us when i asked the manager about the buffalo chicken sandwich not having any lettuce and tomato she said they just got new menus and that description is not correct and that buffalo chicken sandwich is supposed to be without lettuce and tomato what a lame excuse even your online menu says under the description for a buffalo chicken sandwich that its supposed to have both those ingredients  served with lettuce and tomato on a freshbaked kaiser roll  thats what the last line in the description of buffalo chicken sandwich says shame on you manager for lying instead of admitting her fault she was blaming it to a new menunot only did we have to pay for something that we didnt order or eat but we got substandard food that was different from what was described in the menu and had to deal with a really bad waitress and insensitive and deceitful manager to top off the whole experience i am never going to come back to any eat n park location ever again and will never recommend one to any of my friends either what a waste of time and money plus dealing with callous and lying people  my goodness i surely had my patience tested this evening|ugh ive always been an eat n park fan but this place was awful it was a friday night and granted it was pretty busy but gawwwwwd it seemed like every single employee was around  years old the service was very slow we ordered an appetizer platter and cheese fries to split easy enough right well they didnt fry anything long enough so it was soggy and all the breading was falling off everything my drink was never refilled even worse we noticed ants crawling all over the window sill next to ushalf an hour later the server decides to ask you gettin dessert we ordered slices of pie to go my slice of strawberry pie was two strawberries and a few crumbs of crust we went up front to pay to find one lady at the register who seemed to be the sole adult employee counting her drawer and nobody else in sight we stood there and evil eyed her for a few minutes and she finally took a break from her conversation to say someone would be with us a few more minutes and finally the girl who was our server rings us up i asked for a different actual slice of pie which she managed to get about five minutes later basically the whole experience was pure torture which is disappointing|possibly the worst dining experience ive had  my husband and i were riding the bike trail in pittsburgh and we decided to grab a bite to eat here since this location is right along the trail  we noticed there were many tables open on the patio so we requested to sit outside  it was rather busy inside so we waited patiently for  minutes until it was our turn to be seated  the hostess then took us to a table inside the restaurant  not wanting to be rude i asked if they were not putting anyone outside for some reason she said the person who took our name didnt indicate that we wanted to sit outside however i watched her write patio next to our name  we were then led outside and told to sit where ever we wanted because it was still basically empty finally happy to be seated we waited another  minutes or so for our waitress to come  she asked if we were ready to order both our meals and drinks so we did  it took another  minutes to get our drinks which we quickly drank because we were thirsty from riding  we were able to get a refill before we got our food since it took over  minutes from the time we ordered it  the waitress came back one more time after we were done eating and i asked it i could talk to someone about how long everything took but she did not seem interested  no apology   nothing  she simply said that sometimes they arent told when someone is seated outside  maybe that would explain the initial wait but why the terrible service after she clearly knew we were therethis eatn park is a joke  extremely slow service and a rude waitress on top of it  the food was ok but paying for that meal made me feel like i was being robbed  a group of people at the table next to us walked out after waiting  minutes for a waitress to acknowledge them  even when a woman at the table asked our waitress if she could order drinks she just went inside and ignored them  whoever manages this restaurant should be ashamed|this has to be the worst restaurant at the waterfront from the second i walked in the door no one acknowledged my sister or myself for at least five to ten minutes which i thought was weird because they were not busy the manager who was standing close and talking to another employee looked briefly at us didnt smile or welcome us turned and continued her conversation we finally get sat at a booth that the hostess sloppily wiped off left crumbs all over the seat and left old trash sitting on the table we sat in the booth for ten minutes waiting for someone to come wait on us before i finally decided enough was enough and left my sister loves eat n park but every time i enter the waterfront store im severely disappointed  ive been a manager and a cook at two very busy restaurants in oakland for over six years so i know what im talking about i have never let anyone stand in a doorway like that i would wait on you myself until the waitress could get to you it is appalling to see what that place has become i will never go back to that place again|the waitress there are extremely rude   on two occasions that i went there the same rudeness was there in  of the older wait staff   not sure what this is about  the first time a lady friend of mine did not order the buffett and the watress tried to charge methen proceeded to argue with melolthis morning another older last kept rolling her eyes at every quetion i hadlolnever go there again|im not a mean reviewer if you look at the other places ive reviewed but this was just so so so disappointing the shanghai style merlin was very poorly done the meat was extremely bland with very little seasoning i have a very low sodium tolerance and yet i still found this fish to be made too bland the rice was entirely uncooked and it made crunching sounds as i took my first bite i talked to the waitress and she offered to bring out another side it wasnt the same the whole dish was a fail and i dont think i am ever coming back again |will i come here again  yes absolutely for drinks they knocked the ketel one extra dirty blue cheese olive martini outta the park  the ambiance is very nice  of the  types of reviews i give awesome ok bad where they get slammed and bad where i hope they improve here i am giving the heartfelt bad where i hope they improve  our waitress was very friendly and did a good job  i mentioned the gritty redskins of the mashed potato  we went with appetizers she recommended  not good  seared ahi tuna horrible flavors mixed with the rub the prep the tuna wasnt cool inside the chips were not good there was no soy sauce but there was wasabi  not good  with heartfelt advice compare this against outbacks ahi tuna appetizer and its no contest  the chef should do so  hes a nice guy like me i hope  bbq shrimp go try redstones philly buffalo shrimp appetizer  it is chilled very delicious  this appetizer was recommended and was garbage  the barbecue sauce was horrible overwhelmed and left an unsavory aftertaste in both my and my clients palate  gordon food service or sysco bbq sauce  a real mustmiss  cod entree was ok  the skillet beans were too firm too mature they need petite green beans  potato skin had grit in the mashed  why  star  the price was close to capital grille but far from the cuisine  i hope they spruce it up  the place is nice|went here for happy hour  initially service was prompt but after the first drink order we had to track a server down in the kitchen to take the food order  it took so long to get we just left  will never go back|whoever gave this place  or five stars must be out of their minds had dinner here in july and it was so so i was looking for a fish place in town again and figured after reading positive reviews that it had improved yikes bad decision the staff seemed put out that anyone was here at all and were seemingly puzzled by the menu i watched two bartenders trying to figure out how to make a strawberry daiquiri for  minutes which was admittedly entertaining i ordered the chowder and the crab cakes the chowder was basically flour stew with potatoes im guessing that there may have been a clam or two in there somewhere but you couldnt taste it if there was through the flour the crab cakes were definitely frozen and not made from blue crab if youre going to offer chesapeake crab cakes they had damn well better be the real deal zero flavor and dry as hell stringy asian crab that was definitely premade terrible i dont like to rip a spot but this was a seriously weak restaurant dont know why i expected western pa to offer up the goods but if chicago can do it well why not pittsburgh best analogy the olive garden of seafood|went there for dinner tonite visiting from out of stat and its close to the hotel where were staying everyone complaining around us took our order quickly told they ran out of bread and we could have crackers waited a half hour for our food   waitress said they were running behind in the kitchen and out of a lot of food asked the waitress to check on our food and waited for her to come back and when we saw her serving water to another group we just left poor service and management|i have tried time and time again to get myself to like this place and every time its more disappointing than the last time i had a take out order today and when i called to place the order i could tell that instantaneously the bartender taking my order was not going to be a pleasure well that was an understatement when i arrived to pick up my order there was class a attitude from the minute i walked in with the bartender then i had a total of  bags and  fountain drinks which she said she had absolutely nothing to put them in for me and i asked her if she could help me carry the bags to my car  her reply no i have tables i need to take care of i dont expect overthetop service at this restaurant but i do expect a smile a nice and pleasant attitude along with a little helpfulness if you arent having a good day dont take it out on customers|this is a really hard review for me to write simply because i cannot for the life of me find the words to explain the food lackluster no not reallymediocrenopedestrianaveragecommonhuh uh just eh it wasnt awful terrible or even bad and it wasnt great good or even fine it was justedible i guess  we started with shrimp dumplings from the happy hour menu and the bf got seafood gumbo i thought the gumbo was decent he said eh however we both agreed the dumplings were eh i got something called the market trio which came with creole style rice corn a crab cake a hunk of salmon and  shrimp it wasnt terrible inedible food it was justnot good and for  i wish i would have just gotten a bowl of the gumbo the only thing that seemed to have any flavor was the rice the bf got a crab and lobster stuffed cod which again was not bad just not good it had a lemonybuttery sauce that didnt taste quite lemony or buttery somehow i know this is a stupid thing to gripe about but i hatehatehate when restaurants charge necessarily high prices for pop soda cola pop call it what you want but it should never be more than  i usually just drink water with lemon but i had a headache so i ordered a coke  and having a bf who works for a restaurant i know that pop costs them pennies i see  some people drink glass after glass of the stuff but  is simply ridiculous especially when the food kinda sucks and i read other reviews and the decor is not classy its like its trying to be classy but real classy restaurants know its not classy it was a little like an overpriced underflavored red lobster without the kickass cheese biscuits but when your food sucks at red lobster you can always fill up on the delicious biscuits|very bad purchase experience i bought a shirt with a hole covered in the rolled up sleeves but they denied my request to return it i am so angery at this and will never shop their chothes anymore|a group of us traveld here to go kenneywood park across the road but we decided not to after what we drove throuhg to get there so we atleast decided to get somthing to eat and man where we happey to get out alive we where the only normal people in this place the kids next to us who where only  where bragging and saying that they went to jail  times in their life you had people selling their food outsdie the resturant after seeing that we quickly left and hid in our cars with the doors locked while we where in there my friend got hit on by  girls and they gave him there numbers while the other young guy across the table yeld dont do it dont do it must i say more bottom line is dont go if you are normal and get the hell out of that area cause if you call a shank a happey meal toy then that is the resturant for you|by far the absolute worst mcdonalds in theworld you can pretty much rest assured that after your long wait in the drive thru your order will most definitely be wrong  calls to the owner go ignored rice enterprises own a majority of the mcdonalds in the south hills  they have all gone down hill in quality service and cleanliness  the owner has to be the problem|you know its bad when a mcdonalds gets a  star reviewi mean seriously none of us expect anything fancy when we go to a mcdonalds the whole point of going to mcdonalds is indulging in some notgoodforyou food on the go in your busy life in my case i just wanted a small mealsnack that wouldnt cost me as much as the stuff in kennywood would i hadnt even eaten at a mcdonalds in about eight years or so and i quickly remembered whyforget the fact that mcdonalds food isnt great we all know its not great the problem here is that they added insult to injury by giving you the worst customer service ever in addition to not so good food for starters i quickly discovered that the drivethru here is the absolute slowest line on planet earth you certainly wont be getting any fast food here then once i finally placed my order and finally got to the window to pay because of course i spent a lot of time waiting for the people in front of me to even get their orders a young woman took my card swiped itand didnt say another word i waited thinking she was printing a receipt  nope eventually  after whipping out her phone and sending a text or two  she realized i was still there and told me to go to the next window for my food whatever i figured forget the receipt by then i was pretty sure she had moved on to other orders and couldnt print my receipt anyway on to the next window where i was given my food and drinkand i proceeded to quickly discover they gave me no straw and for some reason layered my big mac as such bread bread patty patty bread seriously how does one even mess that up i give one brownie point because the fries really were actually pretty goodbut they were not worth the wait or troublei concur with the other reviewers skip this place completely just keep driving anywhere else is better and less of a waste of your time and money and the people here are so slow that youll spend more time waiting for your food then you will eating it|i was very disappointed in the quality of the pierogies and the haluski at pierogies plus  i ordered them hot and i purchased enough so that i could have leftovers the next day  when i got home and opened the containers something smelled odd  when i started to eat it tasted just as odd  as it turns out what is referred to as butter sauce is a misrepresentation of what it really ismargarine which i eliminated from my diet years ago because of the trans fats and the fact that any way you cut it butter makes for a better product  sorry allison b aint no butter here  margarine is used as a costcutting measure and it just cant measure up  i rinsed off the peirogies and browned them in some butter and my own onions   the haluski got thrown away  for the prices being charged for these products the proprietor can wellafford to use butter|this was a good place to get pizza  as far as i know they are no longer open at this location|jackie b is dead on the staff is anything but friendly actually downright mean|the food was alright not good not bad and considering the portion the prices werent bad either the service on the other hand was terrible severely understaffed three hours order to check worst of all the chef put cooked lobster tail back into the raw shell to serve it avoid at all costs|i would give our experience zero stars possible negative stars its valentines day an order was placed weeks in advance for a delivery my boyfriend went to the shop to ask where the delivery was and the woman at the counter could not have cared less that he was perturbed weather conditions are not ideal for deliveries today but no attempt was made to communicate that the delivery would be delayed just a little hey someone is sending you something special were doing the best we can placate us i received a call at  saying i needed to be home to receive the delivery wheres the surprise in that what if its just a regular day and im getting surprise flowers would i have to get them myself if i wasnt home well my flowers are not being delivered today my arrangement is sitting at the shop because i was chosen to be the loser of who gets their flowers on time the surprise of my arrangement was also ruined by the shop when they said what it was how

is the last straw i recently posted a photo of my chicken ranch club that has no chicken this is ridiculous i am done going to this mcds|delivery is slow and not even close to the best chinese in the area  no matter if its rice or noodles or chicken or pork everything tastes offlike its been overcooked in mopbucketwater  try house of lee instead|the prosyou get a ton of food for your money if the food was actually decent this would have been even better because leftovers they have coupons on their website that you can use whenever the consthe woman who answers the phone is kinda rude you try to ask her questions and she gets an attitude with you like youre wasting her time my pork dumplings were fried only on one side and were raw in the middle everything was pretty darn salty yeah i get it chinese food tends to be a little salty but this was unacceptably salty leftovers yes this is also a con because i threw it away suffering through it once was enough if youre craving something made fresh that is spicy and sweet youre not going to find it here just very greasy very salty poor excuse for chinese takeout|if you have any common sense at all please dont stay here  once it almost burnt downand im pretty sure most of the locals were chanting burn baby burn|i just moved into my new apartment in the area and called for a take out order the place had received good reviews so i thought why not i was hung up on twice before i could even get my order out we were finally able to place an order and told  minutes we live  minutes from this restaurant and we left immediately after placing the order ten minutes later my phone rings and it is the man who took our order telling me that he was closed and would not wait for us to get there to pick up our food because he had told us  minutes if you are going to order from here please make sure you stick to their timelines and if you do go to pick it up and make it there in time it is very hard to find|horrifying  this place should be ashamed of itself  do not stay here  beyond dirty just absolutely rank|omg who wrote the review below a big fat liarsomeone that was paid to write that i stayed there for an hour this past weekend my friend and i were both intoxicated and figured laying down a few hours would get us better suited to finish driving home this place looks like it hasbt been cleaned or furnished since the s literally there was grime on the walls and squashed unwiped bug smears too ok so not the best but for two hours we could deal we looked for bed bugs and didnt see any immediate signs of them so we laid down to rest after about  minutes we both started itching like crazy i ran to the bathroom mirror there was mold all over the bathroom and saw bed bug bites all on my shoulders arms and legs horrible please health department shut them down its deplorable in there|i cant even rate this place its absolutely disgusting i begged the health department to shut them down i was forced to stay a night here and it was so disgusting i woke up with bed bug bites all over my body just filthy do not stay here|this motel is so ghetto even the bedbugs carry guns dont stay here unless youre looking to indulge your sense of urban adventure fact this motel has an hourly rate think of that what you will the only good thing i can say about the avalon motel is no one has gotten murdered here recently|got bit up  bed bugs wouldnt believe me i had to show my bite marks  even then refused to acknowledge me|im writing this out of anger  so bare with me  i was desperate for a place under night  i  am not a picky person  i was homeless in texas for  months on the streets once   life has turned around for me since then  the avalon motel is a sesspool of filfth and disease i am not exaggerating  how in hell did this place pass a health inspection bull   i checked in at pm on a thursday night  got my key and walked in looked horrifying but what the hell  i was tired and just needed a warm half clean bed to sleep in  i peeled back the sheets and noticed tons of little black spots on the pillows and sheets  the closer i looked i realized there were tiny smears of blood all over the sheets too  that alarmed me because those are sure signs of bed bugs  so i peeled back the fitted sheet and omg  dead dried bed bug carcasses bed bug poop blood splotches all lined the entire length of the mattress  not exaggeratingi had the misfortune of living in an apartment building once that became infested with bed bugs after i bought a used mattress off craigslist  it was hell getting rid of them even after throwing the mattress out  if one egg gets on your property your done  every night you will go to bed and be unable to fall asleep because you feel them crawling on you once you finally do manage to fall asleep you will wake up the next morning to dozens of bites all over your body that can inflame into the size of dimes and ooze puss  they itch bad and take weeks to dissappearas soon as i saw the bed bugs  minutes after entering the room i went back to the clerk and kindly demanded my money back on grounds that the room was not up to health code  i could put up with the other deplorable disgusting repulsive problems with the room but i drew the line at sleeping with live parasites in my bed    wtfi begged for my money back and explained that proir to check in i only had  in my bank account and spent half of it on the room and did not have enough money left to go to another hotel  and asked repeatedly to please get my money back for a room that i had not even used and just purchased  minuted prior the clerk refused and toted their beloved health department approval certificate  how in the hell they got iti dont know  had to be fake   she called me a liar and said there were no bed bugs and no one else has complained  i practically begged her to walk to the room with me so i could show her the obvious hundreds of bed bugs infesting the entire room  her response    oh im not going out there its cold   these are the kind of people were dealing with folks and she  proudly kept my  and said i was welcome to go sleep in my car in the  degree weather  disgusting people who live to cheat citizens out of their money the epitome of whats wrong with the world  very sad   oh yeah so dont stay here|terrible no one expects fast food to be gourmet but this experience would make corporate cry ordered food for  adults full meals and for one child and was charged for  more adult meals i asked why the amount was so high and the employee said nothing to me looked the other way and yelled for a manager still feeling over charged but not wanting to agitate the situation any further we left with  less drink then we ordered cold food and a soda water instead of sprite because no one changed the syrup never again|we keep expecting their food to be better than the last time ive had enough ordered two spicy chicken combos yesterday at around  oclock youd think the food would be fresh during the dinnertime rush well youd be wrong the sandwiches and fries were all lukewarm and both chicken filets were so dry and tough that they must have been sitting under a heat lamp for hours we ordered an unsweetened iced tea and a sprite with no ice received an unsweetened tea with no ice and a cup of ice with some sprite in itweve previously been treated rudely for having the gall to use the drive thru  minutes before closing time im trying to remember if we have ever been served a satisfactory meal there but im having trouble coming up with a single example i can only assume that the manager is never there or is so incompetent as to defy belief this location coasts by solely on the reputation of other wendys do yourself a favor go to burger king or mcdonalds down the road or hike up to the wendys at west view park|they kept trying to staple my poor dogs infected wound after taking her to another vet i was educated about wound care after she was treated properly she healed quickly|where to begin i guess ill start with me taking my last cat there about two years ago because i was worried he was sick he cried constantly when i left his sight i assumed he was trying to tell me something so i brought him to avh where he had been seen before by dr albu wonderful vet this time my cat was treated by another vet who simply wrote meows too much on on the chart great diagnosishoping to get a different vet next time i took my other cat there everyone is always very kind and loving to him but it always takes the vet at least  minutes past the appointment time to see him not to mention they are always so overbooked that i am forced to sit in the waiting area with at least  barking dogs at once their owners try to calm them but my cat shudders and shakes in his cage and i am unable to hold him and comfort him you try holding a scared cat in a room full of dogs i wont be returning to avh|they do not care about animals  i had been taking bothof my dogs there for  years for regular veterinary care my youngest dog came down with stomach cancer while i was unemployed she needed to be euthanized and i made an appointment put my poor bloated sick dog into the car and took her for her final visit  they demanded i pay up front before she was even seen by a vet and i asked for billing having been a yearslong patient who has always paid i didnt think it would be an issue especially considering the pain my dog was in  they refused to do the euthanization and would rather leave a sick animal years long animal patient of theirs  in pain and suffering than to do the courtesy of sending a bill to a regular customer  disgusting   who does that never will i take another animal there i now have a new vet that actually cares about animals and how they feel and whether they are in pain|stay away the owners are so rude they blatantly say they are not doing well and then try to pretend they have the best hairdressers in pittsburgh they make you feel so unwelcome advertise they offer a bunch of services and then when you ask they snap at you that they only do hair  it was so awkward and weird   i received warnings not to get my hair done there so i was going to get a pedicure because i had a gift certificate  she told me her employees will only take cash if they have to touch a clients feet  i may go there just to get bangs trimmed since i do not want to completely waste the certificate but this place gives me the creeps sounds dirty and has beyond bad customer service  they definitely do not know how to run a business and it is obvious why they are not doing well sue and kristi pass the phone back and forth because noone wants to take a call  she reiterates that the business is doing bad and they need more clients  i have never experienced a ruder salon or should i say dead beat shack|i think it is ridiculous that they say they need more clients  i was all ready to be a new client  i had a  appointment with them and when i arrived at  on the dot the place was locked and dark and no one was there  i waited for five minutes in the rain and they still didnt show  i called and left a voicemail saying that i was still willing to wait and i understood if there was some confusion but could they call my cell i gave them the number as i had previously given my home number when i made the appointment  i waited nearby at a coffee shop went back after another five minutes and it was still locked and i hadnt received a call  and i am definitely not estimating the time either  i was willing to wait a bit and i looked very closely at the time on my phone to be sure that i wasnt jumping the gun on calling and then leaving  finally i went on with my day and when i got home they had left a voicemail on my home phone which i had specifically asked them not to call saying oh hi  sorry you missed me but i was maybe two minutes late at the most  i hope you havent left but you should just call back to reschedule  seriously  when i was waiting another woman came to the door  i thought she worked there but she was just another client also trying to get in  when i told this story at another local business the women there said that i was probably the fourth person who had had this same experience at this place  i couldnt believe it  this place is the worst and i have never even stepped inside|now im picky about my hair but mane attractions was so bad that i walked out after about  minutes of watching the stylists work on other clientsi had desperately needed a haircut and walked in for a major trim and reshaping of my layers  first the girl at the counter said my hair might be difficult due to the length it was nearly long enough to sit on at the time and that i would probably have to stand while it was cut  weird but okay  second no one there knew anything about donating to locks of love and i feel like salons should be aware of things like that  i needed a cut so i went for it anywayi watched the two stylists while i waited for my turn  one stylist told the client whose hair she was cutting that she was going to do something other than what they discussed because it wasnt looking right  ummm okay  the other stylist was too busy checking her phone every three seconds to notice she was yanking on her clients hair so hard with the comb that she was giving her poor client whiplashat that point i just pretended like i had received an urgent text and said i have to leave so sorry as i bolted for the door|got a key lime pie from this place it was horrid icing was stale cake thick crust was not even crunchy or had taste and the key lime was weak pie looked it it was sitting out for a day or |on october   i placed a  order for tortes and cookies to be picked up the following saturday and was told no problem when i placed the order the girl taking the order was new so another girl helped but her attitude was very poor and told me that i had to put down a deposit and pay  for trays for cookies and they dont tray tortes i told her that was fine and i paid the order in full the following week i showed up and my order was never placed so they had nothing no manager or owner could be reached and the poor girl waiting on me was so shook up the girl that had the attitude the week before and was suppose to place the order  was very nasty and insisted that it had to be under a different namelong story short we had to make shift the order and put up with a very sarcastic counter girl i will not return to this place again i have been using them for years and never saw a business run like this my daughters worked for years for a well known bakery in college and said were never left alone like this unfortunately a man beside me came in to pick up cupcakes for his childs birthday and it was paid for and experienced the exact same thing as i did shame on you lincoln to run a bakery like this oakmont here  i come oh and as for the cookies i got no trays and  dozen of sugar cookies that all looked the same the girls that took the order were there and one whispered to the other wondering if they would be fired over this and the smart mouth answered no they dont worry about stuff like this and the lady just needs to get over it|do not buy from metro motors  bob  i read ad on auto trader that had car listed with auto windows sunroof

a store that makes me thankful for goodwill and the salvation army resale stores  the customers and the staff are miserable at red white and blue  the clothes are priced far higher than other such shops  merchandise is not refundable or exchangeable and there are no fitting rooms  one purchases clothes at their own risk  what person would buy a suit under these conditions hoping the pants will fit  unlike other stores there is no senior discount and no credit cards accepted a rare cash only business  to the reviewer who boasts that everything is  off every day how is that a sale  it is

required to wear a fancy uniform so i looked highly presentable i picked a shirt up i was thinking of getting and held it as we browsed through the store they announced they were closing and i was across the store from where i got the shirt deciding not to get it i placed it on a near by shelf my friend checked out and as we were walking out of the store a  woman that worked there said to me where is the shirt you were holding i told her i had placed it on the self in the back and said sorry for not putting it back she said  i walked back there and didnt see it so where is it and clearly implied that i stole it  i told her again that it was on the shelf as nice as i could and she then told me that she didnt believe me and told me to go back there and get it or else she was going to search me now i get that it doesnt matter that the shirt was  cents because stealing is still wrong but because i didnt steal it and told her so i feel im justified in being furious that i was publicly humiliated and falsely accused over  cents i walked to the back of the store picked it up and started walking back and then the lady said in a grossly rude tone  well i didnt see it back there no apology no nothing i handed it to her and walked out ive never been there since i was so angry i forgot to get her name tag so i could complain to the manager i have never been treated so badly by anyone let alone a complete stranger and store clerk i dont shop at stores that hire such terrible staff|this place is overpriced and the service is not good at all  when we where there children were riding bikes in the lot near the tables  one almost hit our child  another customer said that if the owner had been there she would have not allowed the bikes to be there  the cone was large to say the least but the taste left something to be desired  not the best neighborhood either with a bar nearby  our children were exposed to language that would have made a sailor blush  we will not be back  also they will accept a credit card but not a debit card  please get up with the times|i had a very unfortunate experience with this groomer my dog  was not groomed to my specifications infact she was butchered i went to the trouble of taking a photo of my dog with  the haircut that i wanted as well as speaking with the woman who assured me she would be grooming my dog the owner groomed my dog not the woman that i spoke with and she looked nothing like my dog when i picked her up the owner was rude and did not even apologize for the horrible service do not take your dog there to be groomed|ive been told several times that this place had a great brunch  upon arrival the menu was very limited and the service was abysmal despite a nearly empty restaurant  we literally waited  mins at our table and then left prior to ordering|bland food and poor service its a shame since its a great location and could be much more especially since there is always overflow from nearby point brugge|what a disappointment evening started pretty badly and did not get much better  we had reservations for  people at pm this past saturday two of us were there early and rudely treated by the hostess she was vague about seating us and we decided to wait at the bar when the rest of our group arrived on time i informed the hostess and she looked at me blankly and then the packed restaurant  she told me it would be awhile huh when asked what awhile was she said min  but then seated us in  she had to bus a table which i take it as one of the things she dislikes about her job  that and peoplefood was a let down potato latkes were greasy and blah  fish tacos were recommended and were basically fried fish sticks  pumpkin risotta was heavy and confusing flavor wise  others had the same sentimentsservice was rough  long waits and lack of attentiveness noise level couldnt converse at all made the night just a bit harer to toleratenot sure pinos will get a repeat visit  disappointment|before pinos was renovated it was a tiny unpretentious holeinthewall restaurant with a friendly atmosphere and amazing italian food it was also a byob which i love this was our goto restaurantafter pinos was renovated there was a complete transformation while the interior is now very nice its no longer a byob and the staff is full of attitude which seems to stem from the total arrogance of pino himselfon our most recent visit we were a party of four with reservations at  pm we arrived at  and werent even acknowledged until  pm pino was playing maitre d and when he finally acknowledged our presence he seemed totally clueless and was overtly unapologetic there were no open tables despite having reservations when  pm rolled around i was frantically calling other local restaurants to see if we could get in no such luck since it was prime dining time on saturday night finally around  pm the waitstaff brought a two person table up from the basement crowded four chairs around it and jammed it into the middle of the restaurant for us to sit in pino then literally threw our menus at us and walked away not so much as a free drink for our inconveniencethe food is still good here but i refuse to give my money to someone who clearly does not appreciate your business there are so many good restaurants in the area with ownerschefs who are happy to have you next time you think about going here walk an extra block to the point brugge cafe|the food here is ok but not worth the price  corking fee  a glass of garbage wine me thinks notwhat really tops it off is the owner is beyond rude and doesnt care about the business i heard it used to be much better but now i dont know anyone who eats there|i went to pinos with my three other friends for restaurant week and was underwhelmed and completely disappointed we chose an option for each course of  the very limited restaurant week menu i selected the baked eggplant caprese appetizer lazy man lasagna florentine and then the panna cotta for dessert baked eggplant caprese the breaded eggplant was a soggy mess lazy man lasagna florentine it was essentially two huge lasagna noodles sandwiching huge clumps of spinach im talking like a inch high pile of clumped spinach with a few mushrooms peppered in the spinach ratio was out of control and i honestly ate a few bites and couldnt even continue panna cotta this was the most decent of the items we orderedmy friend ordered off the regular menu which she advised not to do since her food would come out at a different time why we tried my friends appetizer of the italian fries which are described on the menu as sounding very similar to the amazing fries at point bruggebut it was just a bowl of regular french fries which were lackluster and misleading she also got the house soup with chickpeas and it looked like spaghettios and tasted even worsei dont know where all the positive reviews are coming from there was not one thing we ate that was impressive in any way all of it was overpriced and below mediocre i wasted my money and i will never ever go back there|i went to pinos recently only to be disappointed by the owner himself i guess i should have read the reviews on here before going seeing as a lot of people echo the sentiments that i feelafter my mother sent back her extremely oversalted steak the chef came out to apologize it was very embarrassing how he chastised her for not enjoying her meal he then snidely commented as walking away that he would never salt his steak again i dont really take kindly to people speaking so rudely to my mother she was very polite about sending it back and certainly didnt deserve any attitude we had an event to attend which we were very clear with to our waitress so when my mother reordered another meal a salad which took another twenty minutes my mom asked for it to be immediately wrapped up the chef returned obviously chewing to make a point and sneered at my mother announcing her steak that she refused to eat was actually quiet good well i have never felt more embarrassed in a situation i said he was being rude to my mother a paying customer he proceeded to get heated and tell me it was not his job to make people happy  and that everyone else seemed to enjoy their meal and we just had to get to the inside of the steak to appreciate it the drama continued when he did not have change for  for a  bill sorry how can you not have  in change he ended the night by throwing our bill in a crumbled mess on the floor and walking out overall embarrassing it was an embarrassing situation for anyone to witness take heed of the negative comments on this site i certainly wish i would have|very disappointing meal  after waiting for a half hour my meal arrived and we were told that my friends meal would be coming in a few minutes very awkwardt  salad was average at best  the beets tasted like canned beets and the chicken was covered with blackish oil from a burnt oil pan  then to make matters worse the chef came out to argue with a patron who returned her food  the chef came out to humiliate the customer explaining that her returned steak was great and himself was enjoying it  eating food from a customers plate was a real turnoffwhat else does he do when cooking to make matters worse when paying the bill the chef did not have change for a  bill for the customer who returned her steak  it was very uncomfortable watching the elderly customer and her young friend deal with the situation he kept  loudly requesting a credit card  and the women did not have one   another customer provided them with change as the chef crumbled the check i think i would have just left and not paidgive the lady great for dealing with such a lunaticlong story shortif you want to eat below average food and watch a chef loose itthis is your place|this was the place i brought friends visiting from out of town when i wanted to show them the classy italian  spots in pittsburgh after my visit last night i have no desire to ever go again i dont know the owner joe personally but he has stopped by our table a few times and said dish looks beautiful he was always confident in his food which i guess is a good thing if the good is delicious  which it usually is  the table next to ours had a two women a mother and daughter the mother asked the server for a new steak as hers was a bit salty ive never had the steak as im vegetarian but my guests have mentioned the abundance of salt the server apologizes and returns to the kitchen the owner comes out and fakes an apology claiming his steaks are perfect at this point the whole restaurant is listening its that crazy  the  best part he comes out again and says i really enjoyed the steak you sent back he was eating the steak and had some in his mouth i cant make stuff like this upat this point the whole place feels bad for the mother and daughter clearly an awkward situation the owner got so nasty the daughter tried to reason with him and he said its not my job to make people happy thats strange considering he wants our business so the mother tries to pay the bill with a  and leave but he said they cant make change eventually another customer helps make change and they leavei couldnt finish my dinner i was so mad  maybe joe was having a bad day but there is no excuse for how he treated those customers  sorry we will never step foot in here again|please never go to this restaurant the food ranges mediocre to downright bland which wouldnt be so bad if it werent so overpriced im sorry but  for a flatbread thats half the size of a pizza is it supposed to be an entre or a joke  for a plate of spaghetti even if the pasta is handmade and i dont think it is thats crazy the wine list is pretty ok but this isnt the only place in pittsburgh to drink wine and i can guarantee you that anywhere else you choose would have better food id probably be more forgiving of the lackluster menu if it werent for other factors because the real downfall at pinos is the owner joe this man has no tact no graceand judging by the food absolutely no talent in the kitchen ive been to pinos a handful of times as its near my home and honestly i really wanted to like it but each time ive been in im surprised by the extent of this mans unprofessionalism he has a very large presence and is very outgoing but not in the way you want youll notice from other reviews that he does not take kindly to criticism if you dont like something you ordered keep your mouth shut or be prepared for a debate over the quality of the product ive even witnessed him making racist comments about his dinersfor example i overheard him one evening saying he was glad that two asian customers had come in that night because theyre good tippers i dont know how they didnt hear him because the dining room isnt that big and this guy doesnt know how to keep his voice down that was pretty much the last straw for me the amount of pride joe and his staff seem to have in their restaurant is completely disproportionate to the quality of food and certainly their customer service take my advice dont waste your time here|probably one of the worst places i have been to recently i have had pasta come out of the freezer that was better prepared  for a mushy rigatoni chicken dish and  glasses of wine incl  gratuity service was very poor  on our table of  server couldnt remember what anyone had for drinks or dinner ever you need to write down something on your pad like woman in blue del solcab sauv to help you thats fine but dont come back all clueless like you had never heard us order i wont be going back  seating was also poor i had reservations and walked in before a large party who was seated before me meaning i arrived at the hostess station first and they took the party behind me before asking me my name i was not the first nor the last to arrive for my party and reservation was in my name|i normally love pinos im a member of their diners  club live  blocks away and often walk there with my dog and eat outside they are very dog friendly however this evening i sat at the bar planing to order wine and dinner while the bartender did give me a wine list she then proceeded to ignore me more interested in chatting it up with the couple at the end of the bar after  minutes i left i thought the days of ignoring and disrespecting solo female diners were behind us i went to park brugge where the service at the bar with amanda is always top notch|definitely overpriced for what they offered  took my car in to check my ac they didnt get back to me for the whole day and decided to fix whatever the problem was without asking me and charging me an insane about approximately  more than most places  definitely will not go back there again|had very bad experience with this autoshop my cars engine stalls at idle and coolant temperature is not right when make turns there is noise from front wheel this garage took more than a week to diagnose my car and gave me a  bill for repair of a lot of unrelated stuff and they didnt even check the cooling system until i ask them to do then they insisted nothing wrong with cooling system other than a loose clamp which is not loose at all and they claim all my cars problems will be fixed they took another week to finish the job and the next morning after i got my car my engine stalls twice within  minutes coolant temperature is still wrong and front wheel noise is still there sent my car back and they said another  to replace several sensors will fix the problems which is nonsense i will never trust them anymore and nether should you they only trick you to do repairs you dont need and never fix a real problem|been yelled at by other customers today for instanceplace is super ghettoavoid at all cost today left a full cart bacause a woman with a baby in a stoller shouted at me for cutting in line will never go back at night it is a nightmare|never again my friend and i went into this giant eagle for a quick trip to pick up some chips and such before going to a party took us three minutes to find some chips we stood in line to check out for about half an hour it was like a window into hell the line was for express there was only one express line and there was only one slow checker i will never step foot in that store again im relatively new to the area and am told this store is referred to as the dirty bird|came to this location for a quick run in and i regret it immensely  decided to get a giant eagle card since my item was on sale  the clerk at customer service was so rude i took my id back and walked away  her language was impossible to understand and when i didnt understand her second mumbling she yelled her question at me  this happened twice  they wont ever see me here again|figure id give supercuts a shot since giant eagle sells their gift cards so it is great for fuelperks  i dont remember her name but she is one of the bigger woman there  i wanted to grow out my hair longer but it was looking messy  so i asked her for a trim to get the sidesback cleaned up  she said ok and off she goes   minutes later we were done   yes just like a bad date we were done in  minutesi got home showered and saw the damage  it was messy  whats worst is every day it grows it looked even worstill just stick to my usual barber|i went there today the cut was terrible i have an awful experience they lady that cut my hair was nice but she wanted to leave early so she made a disaster in my head|terrible i got a haircut here once and hated it but kept waiting for it to settle in after a few washes it never did look right so i just fixed it at home rather than going back to these incompetent people i didnt even feel like the hassle of complaining was worth it as i highly doubted that id get any money refunded and i certainly didnt want them to touch my hair again to try to fix it i then figured hey this place sucks for haircuts but they cant mess up eyebrow waxing right right but their service is so bad that i gave up on that too  i got my eyebrows done here a few times with not much trouble but the last time i went in i had called ahead to put my name in and was told that i would be next on the list and to show up in about  min my house is a  min walk from there perfect i headed out got there in  min and gave the woman at the desk my name and reminded her id called ahead there was one man sitting there waiting who i had seen from across the street walking in about  min ahead of me the stylist was just finishing up a haircut so i should have been next right since i had put my name in before the guy who walked in nope she called him over and i said sorry i think i was next i called ahead and was told id be next in line and the lady said oh we dont do that wtf you told me very clearly that you do exactly that what craziness is this so i waited figuring that id already invested  min into this venture so i may as well stick it out and waited and waited while one stylist cut the mans hair and  of them chatted in the back ironically next to the chair where they do facial waxing they must have been on break or maybe just terribly rude and idiotic because i sat there waiting for another full  min and when i finally spoke up again to ask when someone would be available to do my eyebrows the  chatty cathies in the back looked over very annoyed at my presence and the woman doing the haircut said after im done here and i sat there incredulous for another  minutes before getting up and leaving will never go back|tasteless food that arrived over an hour after it was ordered and was cold  will never order from here again|never received my order and was left in a bad mood the driver did not carry gps for delivery did not know my address which is right in squirrel hill did not listen to me or did not understand me when i tried to give him directions asked me to pick up food from an intersection  miles away from my apartment in snow and finally yelled at me to cancel my order cannot comment about food but whatever experience i had left a bad taste| food arrived  hrs late the delivery driver was the guy from the pizza place next door and didnt know anything about the order food was lukwarm when it arrived the food was completely inedible the sweet and sour chicken was disgusting it was a neon pink color and tasted like dried out chewy dog food beef tasted like it was bad and honestly i nearly puked after the first mouthfull the only thing that was edible was the rice which was average at best theres  down the drain never again|worst in pittsburgh just got the moogoogai pan with hotsour soup which is one of my regulars i read on here that they have a  minimum so i ordered some fried wontons to make up the difference i was charged  because i didnt say lunch special when the size i was given was obviously lunch sized the wontons were horrible dry crackers with a marble sized price of meat inside no dipping sauce with the wontons hotsoup was bland was so small i thought it was my dipping sauce opened up my moo goo and it was mostly broccoli and zucchini almost no chicken got an extra fortune cookie thoughi will not be eating here again total disappointment|i wish there was a zero star option to give this may be some of the worst chinese ive ever been delivered first off everything was dripping everywhere the entire bag was a soggy mess then we get to the chicken chow mein im not even sure they bothered to cook that my boyfriend couldnt even look at it once taking a bite it made him sick next up the general tsos bean curd under cooked and not properly drained of any water i dont know what that sauce was made from but it was disgracing all general tsos sauce by existing the egg rolls a chinese classic were so dark and hard im not sure how we could have possibly eaten them the crab rangoons generally these are my favorite thing at a chinese restaurant im not sure what they think they are attempting to pass for crab rangoons here these monstrosities were completely inedible the only thing they didnt mess up on our order was the rice it tasted and looked like rice when we called to complain i was told the restaurant said they did nothing wrong and wouldnt do anything about the situation awesome now my stomach is upset from the few bites i tookim pretty sure this place should change its name to inedible slop because its far from tasty|bleh ive tried a lot of pizza places and this is so bad the crust is not homemade pretty sure i saw them take it out of a plastic bag and it sure tastes yuck it wasnt very hot either i am definitely going elsewhere next time|we were visiting from out of town and just spent  hours driving found this place read reviews on yelp which were ok and decided to ordered two slices humsorry not slices more like two squares of cheesy bread when we said these arent slices the lady at the register looked confused as though pizzas always look like that we obviously arent locals by the way we were dressed so the lady who talked terribly should have notified us when we first ordered it they also have pictures of real pizzas on the wall it also took a really long time to cook those little things because they werent pizzas since i was so hungry i ordered another square of unhappiness and it was handed to me in the cooking wrapper not a paper plate ugh definitely never going there if we come to visit again|this place has the worst service ive ever seen i called in two cold sandwiches and was told it would be  mins when i got to the counter the lady working rudely told me to wait for my name to be called because she didnt have my ticket to ring up the order um okaythen walk over and get it so i can pay for it so i waited and waited as people who came in long after me got their orders the workers just stand around and spend more time talking to the regulars and trying to act like they are a big deal i had to leave without my order after  minutes do not go here|worst pizza i have had in my entire  years of life tasted like sauce and cheese on toast frozen pizza is better than their pizza i wouldnt eat this pizza if it was free|used to be the staple of the community years ago before home depot my mom uncles aunts and even grandparents would grab a bite here ever since i can remember on a trip home pregnant and all i went to visit and was extremely disappointed i ordered a chicken salad  picked it up drove  mins to my family home only to discover that there was no chicken in my chicken salad wtf when i called the guy who answered was already anticipating my call  i assume because before i could explain to him the error  he stated yup and pretty much ended the call i debated for several moments whether or not to return but my little one made the decision for me when i returned  i thought id at least be offered a pop for my troubles  or even a hear felt apology for the inconveniencenope my chicken was placed on top of the salad and the young girl at the register offered me an additional ranch dressing for my trouble  wow is all i could muster up what happened to the ventos that was once nestled between foxs bar and the cleaners in front of searsor the one on the corner  across from that single apartment building now like everything else in east liberty this once regarded community staple is quickly transitioning to the gentrified community of tomorrow  all fluff and no substance out with the old school in with the new literally  i hate that ish|hands down minutellos is overpriced cafeteria food olive garden seems like fine dining compared to this place you can already tell how bad your experience is going to be when they give you the complimentary bread that looked like it was bought from a convenience store not the crusty italian bread the generic giant eagle whole wheat bread that i buy regularly tasted x better this socalled italian bread came with prepacked airline butter no dipping oil with herbs and spices then we had the wedding soup which looked like its been sitting in the kitchen since this morning and was just reheated we had the appetizer platter which was composed of allegedly banana peppers calamari and breaded zucchini it was  breading i can barely taste any calamari or zucchini the worst was the marinara sauce which tasted like it came from a can again no herbs and spices for the entree i ordered rigatoni and my fiance had baked ziti the only way i can describe the sauce is think of diluted ragu my pasta was also overcooked and there was no flavor whatsoever so i had to put so much parmesan cheese i couldnt even taste garlic in it what kind of italian food has no garlic the baked ziti was overcooked and dry and it was tasteless according to my fiance service was slow but there was only one waitress in the restaurant i requested warm water and it took about  minutes until she finally served it she was generally nice and probably embarrassed for serving such crappy foodhow much did it cost us  including tipthis restaurant was probably good back in the day as we left the place we saw a certificate of excellence for being one of the best restaurants in pittsburgh in |this shell station is horrible the bathrooms arent inside like getgos theyre outside and around this sketchy corner filthy dirty with gang signs and cigarette butts littered on the floor the store itself is tiny and cramped with many items out of stock and  people who work one register the parking lot itself is pitted and dangerous even by pittsburgh pothole standards this place is ghetto this is the place all of the thugs and gangsters come to get their slim jims and hang out people paid for things in nickles and penniesthat was my first experience at the store my second experience months later  i blame a lapse in memory found me driving down baum and thinking hey i could use gas and my car is crazy dirty i wonder how much that shell places car wash is it wont be so bad if i never have to go inside the store so i googletexted real quick and called them after  rings someone picked up the phone and mumbled at me i cheerfully asked how much the car wash was we cant give that information over the phone wait what why not i just want to know to compare it to getgos which is  sorry well thats stupid let the manager know i think hes an idiot sure clickso come for the ebola laced bathroom stay for the nihilistic attitudes|be careful paying with cash here i coughed up the  cash i had in my pocket went out to the pump after attempting to pump gas and getting maybe a pint it just stopped working i had to wait in line again to get to the counter after waiting they told me it had pumped we went round and round with their solution being that they could print me a receipt and i could come talk to the manager about it this was  unacceptable but there wasnt much to do about it in the face of their utter indifference zero effort and a horrible attitude ive had a history of not great experiences here and thats saying a lot its a gas station how hard can it be its clear that they do not care at all this past incident just seals it im never going back and you shouldnt either|horrible experience i was rear ended at a stop sign wasnt my fault mikes did the repairs poorly trunk lines off bumper lines off wires for taillights hanging rear header panel was pushed in from the accident taillights pushed out after accident mikes didnt repair any of these issues even after i had told them during the estimate also found chips dumped out on the passenger side floor they are truly an express shop i wouldnt recommend them to anyone|please do not adopt any pets from here until they update their standards  i hate to think of animals living in cages but at least two cats adopted from here in september have diagnosed with the herpes virus by the vet and this is contagious to other cats aka it is likely that the shelter staff is not washing hands between handling pets and they are not testing for a virus that can be fatal in kittensi recently adopted a kitten from their shelteri picked him up from their pittsburgh public market adoption station  i was told that he had been tested for common feline viruses and uptodate on vaccinations  these were both untrue statements  the kitten has the herpes virus and was not vaccinated against this  my roommate who was with me and i were warned about the upper respiratory infection uri that can occur because of this virus and others but we were not told that he was neither tested nor vaccinated for the herpes virus  they gave me a paper with his vaccinations but it was in vetspeak so i took their word for it furthermore the shelter staff put my kitten in my roommates name mistakenly and claimed that if we just called in that they would fix this mistake but then wouldnt so when he got sick no one from their clinic would return my callsim guessing this was since i wasnt the owner according to their records  i had to email them to get a response which basically said sorry that we didnt return your calls but this is your problem now  they never apologized for the kittens health or asked if he was feeling better  wheres the compassion for the animalso now i have a very sick kitten on my hands  i took him to the big easy in lawrenceville when he stopped eating and dr ruiz is the best  she took care of him but it cost  to treat the virus he picked up at the shelterthe animal rescue league shelterclinic said that it does not and will not cover expenses for this  after i had already taken him elsewhere the clinic staff said that they would have given me a discount if i had waited two days to go to their clinic but who would wait two days while the kitten wouldnt eat  and now this virus makes him ineligible for pet insurance  it  will cost hundreds of extra dollars a year to keep him healthy had i not fallen in love with the little monster i would have taken him back to another shelter  thats what the person who adopted the other kitten with virus did  whenever he gets an outbreak he will get another uri  this means a lethargic cat who sneezes gags and coughs because he cant breathe and who wont eat because hes too congested to smell his food  its very sadprotect your cats with the herpes vaccination pleaseoh and in case you were wondering just like in humans cat herpes is fo life  poor little guy  this also ruins my plan of getting another cat in the future  bad shelter|this is a terrible shelter  it appears that they routinely turn away or kill unless you state you will take them back cats because they are overcrowded  they will tell you that your cat has a  behavioral issue to address turning said animal away mark that you will take your cat or dog etc back or else you risk having them put down|staff members here have always come up short a past kennel worker  sold his litter of pit bull puppies in east liberty and the shelter was made aware of it  but excused it they will lie to surrendering families because they dont  want the cold hard truth the good bad and the ugly to leak out to the public they lie  they kill many many animals because of a very subjective behavioral test that their dog hating staff performs they kill more pets for space than any other pittsburgh sheltermany volunteers walk on eggshells here because they know an animals life is hanging in the balance and they are afraid to speak up or not allowed back in to volunteer  weak leadership this is the cities highest cat and dog death rate of any shelter or rescue in western pa|they did my dogs neutering surgery and they did not do it correctly which resulted in it opening the next day the listed emergency number did not answer and when i did get ahold of them i was immediately told it would be at least  to have him seen i had to take him somewhere else get him seen and then back to the animal rescue league to it done right my poor baby went through hell never again will i take my dog there|there are a bunch of pretentious self ritiuos self entitled ass clowns the pious smiles on those stupid faces was only topped how they were too busy to find my dogs stollen colllar i left my dog in my car for less then  minutes in the shade with the windows down and some strumpet called  and animal control takes my dog to this shelter who then charged me  to get her back on top of losing her colar then they treat me im a villian because the reporting woman said the dog wasin the car in the sun with the windows up for over  hours i guess they trust total freak show losers more than their ownersi literally rescued this dog from the woods in texas a kill on site state she was  lb starving scared and looked like a skeleton she was sick six ways to sunday i spent  dollars getting her healthy and got kick out of my apartment which didnt allow pets then spent another  dollars when she got a punchured lung at a dog park  this all for a dog i found in the woods do you really thing im going to lock it in a car to die am i really a villian the crew at that shelter need to check their attitudes before treating people like michael vickoh yea when i asked if there was another option besides paying this outrageous bill the uncaring bearded ropepusher casually said we euthanize or put up for adoption yours we would euthanize i hate that place and everyone in it|this guy isnt a tailor hes a butcher seriously    i brought in two suits i got them back two weeks and  later the pants were an solid inch short of the top of my shoes ive had twenty or more suits professionally tailored in the course of my career and ive never said anything other than generous break  the pants fit on the middle of my hips and the crotch fit like a bad bicycle seat the coat had the oddest roll ive ever seen diagonal from shoulder to waist it was so bad that i didnt even take it back to complain as lacked any confidence whatsoever that he could fix it took everything across town and for less than  they were able to work with the pants but there was not enough fabric left in the coat to offer any help bad really bad|never again let me repeat never again the primary reason i used to visit this store was to fill medical prescriptions due to their repeated inability and ineptness in fulfilling simple requests i cannot continue to patronize this storewalking into the store you are given the stinkeye by a minimum wage security guard which automatically gives you as a customer the warm and fuzzy guiltyuntilproven guilty feeling a shoplifter would get which is what this store assumes everyone is based upon their decision to lock up the mouthwash and shampoothe pharmacy seems to be staffed by high school interns  they have no concept of customer service nor do they display any attention to detail which is quite frankly frightening in a pharmacy  i really think my chihuahua would make a better pharmacist than the people who work here  my chihuahua lick you to death before you got your prescriptions but at least youd get greeted when you approach the counter and youd get what you ask forthe first mishap was when my wife and i changed prescription insurance providers  i handed wannabe pharmacist  my new insurance card  after spending about  minutes staring into a computer screen behind the counter he assured me that they had my insurance information in the computer  i then returned in the following days to fill a prescription trusting in what wannabe pharmacist  had told me in the days prior  when i went to check out the bill came to over  which i chalked up maybe i have to meet a deductible before the coverage kicks in  upon further research we discovered that wannabe pharmacist  had not updated my insurance information and had run the numerous prescriptions i filled under my old insurancethe latest of many adventures involved my wife calling in a prescription refill  we stopped to pick it up on the way home from work only to be told when we arrived that the insurance wont cover the refill until tomorrow  again she called and spoke to one of them to refill the prescription before showing up  i guess its too much to ask to tell someone youre speaking to on the phone that they need to wait a day for the insurance to work before coming into a ghetto pharmacy to not pick up a prescription  but hey at least wannabe pharmacist  behind the counter was dressed like a stripper which gave me and my wife some comic relief for the moment  we then returned the following day to again pick up the prescription we called to have refilled  days prior  we were first told by wannabe pharmacist  that there werent any prescriptions waiting for us  after searching around for a few minutes they found my wifes prescription refill but it would take  minutes to be ready  yes the prescription that we tried to pick up yesterday would need another  minutes to be prepared  hence i am now here writing this reviewnever ever again|tire replacement was told it would take about  hours when i had an existing appointment its almost been  hours and im still waiting ridiculous|i experienced three main issues with this goodyear location while purchasinginstalling a new set of tiresthey did not have my name or appointment in their system when i showed up fortunately they still honored my appointment they did not install tires correctly left for a business trip the following day and once i got on the highway and my speed passed  mph the car began to rattle with my new comfort tread tires booked an appointment and they fixed the issuetwo months later i went to my toyota dealership for routine maintenace the dealer mechanic found that the lugnuts on the tires had been over torqued by goodyear so the toyota mechanic had to saw them off of each tire and replace them with nonsecurity locked nuts if i had a flat on the side of the road i would have been solall of these issues were entirely preventable the lack of expertise and techincal skill at this goodyear location is abysmal i do not recommend|i was just there this morning for a am appointment to get my summer tires swapped out for my winter tires  my regular mechanic was overbooked and there is snow coming on monday  receptionist scheduled me in just fine and the quoted price was reasonable so i said ok  upon arrival store manager stated that they will not touch the car as it has aftermarket rims and lug nuts  he did not state any restrictions about aftermarket parts as they could not guarantee the work  i asked if this was the case for all rims and he became a little snotty  i had heart surgery a while back and i cant do the jack and tire work as not to tear at my incisionbreastplate if this was not the case with my health id certainly take care of it  aftermarket rims are common  should not be an issue  last time i ever set foot in that place|i went in for new tires and a routine oil change when i called about my cars status after many hours i was told that the machine they use to pump the oil malfunctioned and motor oil got all over my cars engine they said it shouldnt be a problem since they cleaned the engine bay but when they brought my car out my check engine light was on they went to clear the light but it came back on again i was told to bring my car in the next day and they will look into the problem on my way home my engine started smoking profusely since my check engine light was on i stopped at a local garage to get it checked out they looked at my engine for me and told me that goodyear must have spilled a ton of motor oil on my engine which caused it to smoke like crazy the mechanic also pulled up the check engine light code goodyear did not tell me when i asked them about the code when i picked up my car which said that my oxygen sensor was malfunctioning the oxygen sensor in my car is connected right to the exhaust manifold and it was clear from visual inspection that oil has gotten all over iti went back to goodyear the next day they took my car in and i waited for over an hour in their lounge no one came out to tell me what they were doing to fix my car or if they were taking responsibility for the faulty sensor i finally had to asked the desk clerk who told me that they were going to replace the sensor and i should come back later goodyear did replace the oxygen sensor free of charge they never apologized for the oil spill no one talked me through what they were doing during the repair i will not be returning in the future|poor service that leaves tenants to fight mildew on their own when asked to repair something rockwel realty will do it on their terms and refuse to give you notice of when they will enter your apartment despite multiple requestswhen asked to clean mildew they did in fact clean it with bleach while also spilling bleach on my sheets and ruining them when told about this problem and that the mildew returned they said it was my fault for not turning the heat up and that damage done during service is an inherent risk the tenant is responsible for and nothing could be done their solution was for me to clean the mildew instead of properly insulating the unit to prevent mildew the entire building also has severe electrical problems that causes all lights to be replaced twice a month no permanent fixes are made to existing units but there is constant construction to expand an old building so they can collect more rent|i am blown away by the code violations in this unit the tenants said they have reported these issues to the owner and to no avail i am hoping to direct these tenants to a lawyer in pa|some things are a blessing in disguisesuch as the time i attempted to relocate to pittsburgh and found a somewhat decent apartment in the north side  i took a tour of the place  i was hopeful the cat smell would be addressed but when the guy said oh you can smell that i should have known then  the apartment needed paintedbadly but i was willing to deal so that the stress of relocation could go away  the unit also had no window treatments no air conditioning and did i mention the cat smells  on a friday i told them i was interested in the apartment they told me to mail my security deposit check that day  i followed direction and mailed it  i made plans for moving  they never called to tell me my rent check wasnt recieved on saturday or the following monday  i had to email them to request a copy of my lease when i was told  the apartment is no longer available someone came in today and gave a security deposit  interestingso when i asked the office that past friday they told me not to bring in my checkthat mail would suffice  something doesnt sound right here  their lack of communication also cost me an additional  in nonrefundable moving expenses as i had put down a deposit with a moving company  definately one of the more frustrating things to happen to me during my relocation but based off the condition the apartment was in coupled with these poor reviews i should be counting my blessings|the people who work here are very rude i have gone back a few times thinking it may have just been the person working that day was just a rude person but no it happen every time i am not a young hip person and felt very out of place there it is like you are walking into someones house and bothering them the people working behind the counter act like you are interfering with there conversation plus it is very dirty perhaps the people working there should try cleaning the place instead of talking to each other i will not go back again|i used to be all about this place before i moved to new york so i was excited this morning when i decided to get coffee for my girlfriend and i seriously fuck this place i came in and everyone gave me the once over and i get the brooding barista act but as a patron and someone who has worked in the service industry i feel like there definitely should be some sort humanesque emotion displayed from these people all three behind the counter looked at me like i had ten eyes and dicks for eyebrows i asked for iced skim latte got a hot one but hey small fuck up it was the exasperated sigh when i corrected them i couldve fucking done without still didnt get an iced skim latte also when i point to something and use the proper name of it i feel like it shouldnt be a problem for an individual of average intelligence i ordered an apple dumpling pointed to the apple dumpling and thought i was watching them put it in there until i turned my head for a second and got a fucking danish it wouldnt have been a big fucking deal if they werent fucking dicks the entire time i was there yeah five out of five stars definitely gonna go again and right my next screenplay|this is the worst service or worst nonservice i have ever experienced since i cant give zero stars im giving the service one we didnt eat anything so i cant comment on the food my husband and i went to buffalo blues last night we stood at the empty hostess stand for a while when no one came to seat us and we couldnt find anyone to seat us we seated ourselves figuring thats what we were supposed to dothe bar was full but not packed there were only two other tables with guests one of which had empty plates on the table during this entire experience after what seemed like forever my husband got up to find a server he literally walked around the restaurant to find someone but couldnt he then tried to ask the bartender but she was just as elusive when he finally found a server  she acted totally shocked that we were there maybe if someone had been doing their job they wouldnt be surprised to find hungry people in a restaurantshe came to our table got our drinks a soda and a water and asked us if we were ready to order when we said no she said she would be back we could see her chit chatting with another server but again couldnt get her attention to come back to take our order after another ten minutes of waiting for her to return we put a few dollars on the table for my soda and we left we ordered a pizza at a local shop and picked it up on our way hometwentyfive minutes passed and we only get drinks such a waste of time it took us  minutes just to make the drive there  of waiting and another  to get home thats over an hour of our evening completely wasted which left us starving after a hard days work i used to work as a server so i could understand if the place was busy and the staff was short handed but it was basically a dead night table top wise i will never go back|went here this past saturday afternoon  my friends and i sat at the pretty much empty bar for over  minutes with no service the bartender walked by us a few times and didnt even acknowledge we were there as we walked out we saw the bartender on the phone and other staff members standing in the back chatting we went next door to mad mex and got much better service|i hate this place i have been here many times and i am just finally getting around to writing a review  let me state that my wife made me go here tonight because my friends wanted to and she said i need to indulge their interests even if they suck buffalo blues is like a hooters except the girls where more clothes and are not as good looking the service is horrendous and the food may be better at hooters  the beer selection is decent at buffalo blues but it is expensive and they often run out of things that are still on the boardmy friends like going for all you can eat wing night but frankly i dont get it you get  wings up front they will give more wings  at a time the problem is that you get those wings in  minute intervals  so the max you could eat is  wings did i mention that  the wings are really tiny and the sauce is tossed on like a jackson pollack painting  they also charge extra for blue cheese or ranch  the wings do not come with celery this is a crime against humanity and the city of buffalo  i chose to detour from wings tonight and ordered a chicken sandwich apparently this was a bad choice  it took a full hour to get my food it was so long that the rest of the table ate their wings and ordered more and the waitress didnt think this was a problem when my meal did arrive everything was cold the sandwich was ok but the fries were just tiny pieces that were limp and flavorlessi paid  for a beer and a sandwich that my friends had to wait for me to eat to leave  i would say i wont go back but apparently i like my friends more than i like good food and service|to be honest i think this is one of the worst bars in the entire city  the food was subpar even for bar food the service was awful especially during a game i do enjoy a good sports bar but i think the thing i hated most about this place was the other people that frequent there its the quintessential shadyside bar equipped with doughebag bros that went to the same fraternity in college and the jersey shore bimbos who pine for them the last time that i went there were two guys throwing up outside of the bar on the sidewalk i fully admit this is a subjective review because this bar was obviously not my scene but i still do not like this place at all|unfortunately the service we were given ruined our overall experience at buffalo blues we sat down and put in our drink order  my husband was excited about the amount of beers they had on tap fifteen minutes later and still without drinks we saw our server trying to hunt the bartender down once the bartender finally started working on our drinks she realized the keg for the beer my husband ordered was tapped we were sitting at the booths right next to the bar but instead of the bartender just telling us so we could make another decision and get our drinks as soon as possible she waited for the waitress to come back to tell her then the waitress came back and did not apologize at all but simply said that he had to pick a different beer because they were out of that one anyway long story short it took way too long to get drinks and there was never any recognition from the staff of the issue the restaurant seemed poorly managed and subpar we will not be back|watched a bartender serve a guy a beer when he was visibly intoxicated he was swaying in circles on the chair next to me i told the manager about it and he told me that guy is just crazy ive seen him much worse so i guess that makes it ok made this paying customer leave after one beer|dr eric segal was a complete ass he was rude and obnoxious to me and my wife we went to him for an adjustment and i left wanting to adjust this idiots face i will deter all of my clients from going here and will personally make sure that this man doesnt disrespect anyone else like he did to us|made an appointment for  they completely forgot i was coming but said they could start on my car in ten minutes and be done in an hour came back an hour later only to see my car in the same spot they said it would take another two hours to start work completely unhelpful and unapologetic|i came in with a flat  they said they couldnt repair the tire because there was cracking on the edges  true there were cracks but they were hairline cracks and superficial  the diagnosis was done just from examining the exterior which i discovered is not sufficient to adequately judge if the cracking is bad enoughyou have to actually take the tire offcoincidentally all four tires had the light cracking and therefore all four tires would probably need replacing  hmmm  how convenient for monrowell even if i give them the benefit of the doubt on the tire cracking the pricing on the tires was ridiculous  my tires which were under warranty would have cost over  to get replaced with crap tires thats with the warranty credit applied  oh but wait they could make me a deal with some inhouse tires that were even crappier for   how did i know they were crappy  i looked them up online  guess what else i found  both sets of tires were significantly cheaper according to the manufacturers website even when including installation balancing and disposal  so no no thank you  i dont want to pay  to get cheap tires on my carfortunately my tire would hold air for a few hours so i drove to another place  they fixed the flat no problem for   guess that cracking wasnt so bad after all|i came in here to have a diagnosis done on my car because the abs light was on they removed all the tires showed me how the sensor and abs work did not perform the diagnosis i originally went in for and told me that i should have the back wheel hubs replaced for a total of  this with a new set of breaks that i knew about and without charging me labor i may not know much about cars but i know how to search the internet and ask for advice i found the cost of wheel hubs they are no more than  each for my car and here they said that they cost  each before labor i also found out that the sensors get so soiled from all the dirt and salt that most of the time all the car needs is a simple wash on the undercarriage you should always have your car washed specially in the winter it may save you sthis place will rob you blindnever have work done in a place like this until you do your homework|i took a subaru outback here for the annual state safety and emissions inspections  first i was charged more for this service than what was clearly posted on the service station wall  secondly i was failed for a lug nut that had rusted to the point that the technicians could not get it off   i was quoted  for them to get it off  i was able to accomplish this with a  bottle of penetrating oil and a breaker bar  when i returned to have the reinspection i was charged for it their policy posted on the service wall clearly states you get a second inspection within  days of initially failing free of charge  this time they were able to get the lug nut off but supposedly could not get it back on  this was odd as i had taken it off and put it back on numerous times to ensure it was okay to pass  they once again quoted me  stating they would have to replace the wheel stud  the new wheel stud cost me  at the local parts store and i did the job in under an hour without a single power tool  this shop is not following the guidelines they have clearly posted on their wall and are fabricating problems in an effort to overcharge you for simple repairs  avoid this shop|ah monro where  minutes is actually  hours and running at the time of this post my car is on a lift with no tires and the employees are smoking cigarettes laughing i cant even escape if i wanted to at least they turned the heat off in the waiting room not like its november in pittsburgh or anything|i wish we had a way to hold this corporation accountable for its crimes against our society|have taken my car here a few times because theres a bus stop out front so its convenient to drop my car off and get to work but after what happened i will never be back they just cost me money and lost my tires in march i blew a tire on a pothole naturally and they replaced the two front tires for me the second tire was fine but you have to replace both i kept it so that i would have a spare if another one blew out put the tires in my basement no problem saved for a rainy day this week i ran over a nail and the tire wasnt fixable so i had to get it replaced luckily ive got a spare i called monro early this morning to see if i could get in but they said it would be tomorrow at the earliest i needed my car so i took it to pep boys three hour turnaround  also the last time i needed an oil change they said they were booked for three days good lord i drop the car off at pep boys and tell them the extra tire is in the back they call me up and tell me the tire is the wrong size what monro gave me the wrong tires back when they replaced them in march so i had to buy a new tire when i had a perfectly good one that is now god knows where the tire was the wrong size and definitely didnt come from my car as it wouldnt have fit on the rim after paying for the tire at pep boys i went over to monro to see what they would do about it they informed me that because i already had the new tire put on they couldnt do anything but the next time i came in they would work with me why the hell would i come back when you just screwed me out of a hundred bucks and a good tire not worth chancing because you couldnt fit me in within a day i get screwed if you need tires go to pep boys on milvalle if you need an oil change go to midas on penn circle theyll be able to get you in and not wait three days|please go to the other

could hear laughing and socializing through my window whatever it was the dining experience was filled with culinary magic and spalike service after some deep meditation i realized that perhaps

had few issues during my time living under them ive come to regret this since i movedfirst of all i have not yet gotten my security deposit back despite being told it would be put right in the mail a few weeks back  im pretty sure i should have received it by this point if theyd sent it when they said they were going to and no one is returning my calls on the subjecti also need them to send me proof that i paid rent to them for the several months i did and they refused to release such information to me despite every single month i paid being my individual share and under my own name because i was not on the lease  i would be more understanding of this if they didnt offer the alternative solution idea of sending in someone id lived with who was or is on the lease to obtain my personal financial records  and i understand that having no one who can do this for me is my problem and not theirs this still comes across as very shady business practiceadd this to the fact that my main complaints living in an apartment they managed were continuously losing hot water and faulty electrical outlets they apparently couldnt fix i would highly recommend going with anyone else if youre looking for a new place in pittsburgh  their rent is very reasonable this is true but its honestly not worth it in the end  go with lobos in all honesty youll have better luck|do not rent from jj land this company is the most unprofessional and unorganized rental agency i have ever dealt with i paid  for a security deposit and heard nothing back from the office every time i called they had lost my pay stubs and application and had no idea what property i was talking about i told them i would not be renting from them mind you i never signed a lease or any kind of documentation and that i wanted my deposit back they said they would return it however i would be charged an inconvenience fee meanwhile i was the one who was being inconvenienced another week passed and i heard not a word from anyone in the office i finally ending up going into the office and demanding my deposit back they still have no idea who i was or what property i was talking about thank god i kept the receipt stay away from jj land|i never write reviews but just had to for this piece of work i usually blow off overly negative reviews read prior reviews about this place assuming they are disgruntled customers looking to whine about somethingwell this place has been completely incompetent getting my title transferred from out of state weekly calls over  months and now my temporary registration has been expired for a week and they dont know when ill have legal plates they promise to call me back right away and it takes a week it is just frustrating that these folks are this incapable of completing a simple job go somewhere else anywhere else|if i could give negative stars i would after this review im writing the president of aa and if action is not taken to correct the disservice at this location i will never be a aaa member again been one since  i recently moved from tn and needed to transfer my title and register my dodge ram in pa  this process is costly regardless of where you go but adding  for every transaction makes aaa the most expensive  im willing to pay for people to deal with this inconvenience for me but aaa has made it worse than going to the dmv  each and every clerk at this location is incompetent uneducated and aloof i should know ive dealt with at least a dozen go to the dmvfor my very simple transaction ive had to return to this location  yes that is seven times and it still is not resolved theyve forgotten to request the title from my lien holder issued the wrong plate for my vehicle neglected to inform me of steps required by the state i mean seriously why would you pay  for each visit just to get it wrong go to the dmvwhy did you return there if you were so unhappy you might ask  well once you begin the process at one branch you cannot transfer to any other branch we went to monroeville to transfer my wifes car and it took  minutes once go to monroeville or cancel your aaa membership and go to the dmvoh and  minutes thats a dream im waited between  minutes and  hours at the east liberty aaa prepare to take the day of work nay the week in order to complete any transaction at this facility go to the dmvit has now been over  months since i started this process and its still up in the air they dont know what i still need to do but they are happy to keep charging me to figure it out  save yourself hundreds of dollars and a weeks worth of lost wages and just go to the dmv yeah it might seem sterile and slow but at least they arent serial criminals itll be over with like waking up from a bad dream instead of the reoccurring nightmare that is the east liberty aaaoh and if you think this is a harsh review call their number   times out of  it just rings and rings once i timed it for more than  minutes before i got an answer with no apology  if you are in the aaa youll know im calling  its the constant ring in the background that nobody answers|i would rather drive out of my way to another home depot than give this location my business employees are unhelpful and the most of them are too busy talking to each other and complaining about their jobs to notice youre standing there in front of them strike that im certain they notice they just dont careim a pretty understanding person but when this sort of thing happens more than once on the same visit its time to go there are plenty of hds around seek them out and skip this one especially if youre going to have questions|what has happened to the east liberty home depot  it used to be my goto place for everything diy but no longer  i stopped by yesterday to pick up about nine items all of them basic home improvement supplies cabinet handles tension rods quarter round molding etc  i came away with none of it  everything we wanted was out of stock  when i asked if i could order it and have it delivered to the store to save the shipping costs i was told that the items i wanted were not qualified for delivery to the store  when will the items be restocked  dont know  would it be possible to get the items delivered from another store in the region  no that messes with our inventory controls  oh but i was told i could haul my sorry butt out to monroeville where the stock of everything i wanted was plentiful  really the staff i dealt with could not have cared less about helping me  maybe because it was a holiday new years eve  dunno  dont care  customer service should not ebb and flow based on the daydate  the east liberty hd used to have shelves full of product and plenty of choices  and the staff was helpful and eager to engage with customers  no longer  it appears that the company has given up on the location and is letting it die a slow and painful for its customers death  very disappointing to me|if you know exactly what you need and wont be asking for any assistance then any home depot is fine however if you do need assistance want to ask questions or take a class then i recommend going somewhere else anywhere else really the customer service at this location is terrible i once signed up for a class here and they even had the class written on the board at the front of the store however once inside they had no idea and after being handed off to different people the fifth employee decided to hold an impromptu class just for me which consisted of him reading the class instructors manual on the computer and then telling me what it said i took another trip here to get some lumber and have it cut and that was an adventure because the employee working in the lumber section had never used the wood cutter equipment id say that  out of  employees will purposely avoid you or wont be able to answer your question now perhaps it is tough for this location to find knowledgeable employees but then home depot corp should bring in a better management team and work to improve their employees customer service skills and content knowledge as the store stands right now it appears that home depot just does not care and thats a shame|waiting  minutes to get one piece of wood cut in an empty store on a friday afternoon  priceless|terrible cashiers here very rudethis homedepot is doing a terrible job never again here|terrible dry cleaners poor customer service i have gone there for convenience sake but ultimately i spend more time pointing out their poor quality and returning a second and third time to fix their mistakes than actually saving time i made the mistake of not inspecting my items at the counter and when i bring them back the next day saying that they are still dirty they have the nerve to make me pay for it again i will never go there again and i recommend you dont either|they do not take pride in their work  while clothes are usually cleaned and pressed well they do not make an effort beyond that  if you ask them to take out a stain they dont clothes given for repairs or tailoring are done right about half the time the rest of the time they get lost  if you ask them to do two things to a garment that is way beyond them   will do the hem but not the button etc  they also lose things more than once  do not take your clothes there because they will damage or lose them|simply awful  i dropped off three suits friday afternoon and the person who wrote my order was rude but i brushed it off and chalked it up to a bad day  as promised they were ready monday after pm  i brought them home and was shocked  the backs of the jackets had the exact same wrinkles in them that they did when i dropped them off  furthermore there was the exact same crease in the left sleeve as when i dropped it off  additionally they did not smell so well  to make matters worse they just hung the jackets on wire hangers without any cardboard to keep the natural shape of the jackets  the suits were all custom tailored and not cheap by any stretch of the imagination i refuse to even let them touch my suits again let alone any other article of clothing  i should have read into the clue of the rude employee but hindsight is always   the worst  ive ever spent  avoid at all costs|theyve ruined my clothes on  separate occasions i would not have returned had i known before i went to wear what i thought were perfectly clean clothes from shadyside valet they are streaky at beststay away they are awkwardly rude in a very nice way also they failed to even attempt to remove stains from my clothes as asked expressly on two other occasions i took care of those stains myself im ditching them and calling my bank to get a refundthat placed is cursed nothing but bad experiences i want you to know im not just an angry customer they really do sucafter reading the other reviews i have them a   starinstead of  giving them one is crime in itself|i called to find out if i needed an appointment to which i was told just come now we can take you then when i gave them my keys they said come back in three hours guy was also trying to push a credit card and seemed upset when i said i didnt want one three hours later when i came to get my car transaction was processed and he was ready to let me go on till i brought up that the paper said something had been broken on my last oil change thats funny because between my last oil change and this one i personally checked them oil meter and it was not broken furthermore i week later i found my cars belt system was broken the guy who fixed it said someone mustve broken and although i dont agree its something they couldve seen not coming back even though its rather convenient|this is the greasiest pizza ive ever had in pittsburgh i couldnt eat it|provolone sticks

and leave our doors open not recommend|when my boyfriend and i were down with the flu we ordered some food here through eat i got a chicken noodle soup and he got the seafood calzone when i unpacked the food and tried a sip of my soup i found that it was cold and had bubbles in it as if there was soap in it i couldnt really taste anything but my boyfriend said it smelled like dishwater to say the least i was disappointed in my soup when my boyfriend cut into his calzone he said the cheese was barely melted we thought it was undercooked and touched the outside it was cold as if it was sitting out in the open for a long time he tried to take a bite but the dough was barely even cooked and the contents of the seafood calzone was cold and tasted sourthis was our first time ordering from here and it was such a sad experience to have since our food was inedible i heard this place was good and had great calzones and tasty soup but what we received was the complete opposite from the praise ive heard about this place|terrible pizza just plain gross the crust was all gummy and the cheese tasted like plastic i would never order their food again gross gross gross|i am not a mean person not a vindictive person i bear the friendly people of pizza parma no ill willbut their pizza was remarkably terriblewent there hungry a bit past midnight looking for a little something before going home to sleep they dont have slicesthis seems to be a terrible stupefying egregious trend in these parts fine the smallest pizza a personal pie costs  and is  in diameter the cashier and i agree that thats a very small amount of pizza and since im hungrier than one and one half mouthsful i get a small which is  i add a mushroom topping i pay my  and waitthere are two seating options inside the store a small wooden bench and two fold up chairs around a little table conveniently they were using the wooden bench to store a rolled up carpet that laid across the whole thing and theyd also elected to fold up the two folding chairs probably because they were tired from a long day of being used as chairs so i waited outside the store on a benchthe friendly cashier and the friendly patrons waiting for their order indoors called me over when my pizza was ready i took it outside sitting in the cold to eat it thinking i hope this  pizza is pretty good opened up the box saw how pitifully small a  pizza is and started eatinglet me say something about pizza if you have decent cheese decent tomato sauce flour water and a hot oven you can make a passable pizza i will eat it and think well this isnt the best pizza ive ever had but its fine that is not what i thought when i ate pizza parmas pizza i thought it would be too rude and insulting to ask for my money back ill just try to eat as much of this as i cani ate three out of the six slices one sixth of a  pizza is a total of    square inches that sounds like a lot of pizza but in fact is a tiny amount of pizza i couldnt stand to eat more than half the mushrooms were fine i fished them out and ate them the cheese was actually terrible it had a strange chemical taste and plasticky appearance the crust was poofy and not crustyashamedly i threw half of a pizza away tonight folks i am not a food destroyer i eat things i dont like and expired foods because i dont want to waste it takes a legitimately terrible pizza for me to actually throw the thing awaywent home made some eggs and guess what the terrible cheese taste from an hour and a half ago its still in my mouth im not making this upi know theres good pizza around here ordered two back to back slices at spak brothersdelicious tasty reasonable price but whoaaaaaaa whoa was this terrible overexpensive pizza sheesh|we ordered their supreme pizza parma pizza it tasted like a frozen pizza but with less flavor which is an impressive feat the crust was hard and flavorless we also had the chocolate cake this was a mistake avoid this place at all costs|when i was a kid

and this place was open  hrs  i thought the late hours alone should give it a star then i had this experiencepoor ventilation i could barely breath its cramped and small with dryers and washers lining two narrow corridors  misleading advertising it boasts high capacity washers an says its air conditioned well the air conditioners and vents in the ceiling both were dripping in black dust and look like they were installed in  which might have been why i felt an instant asthma attack coming on then the high capacity washers were all of  not great enough to meet demand as it turns out one girl took up both of them while i was waiting then another woman waited for hers to wash and took up two again this was at   pm at night so i can only imagine what its like to try and get one at other hours then there was this guy i guess he was an attendant or the owner he was wiping down the machines and dryers i was moving my clothes out of the dryer and i had put my bras hangers and a few shirts on top of my washer i was literally loading right in the same area and was heading back to grab my things when he touched themugh laundry violation ya dont touch someones wet clothes it feels like that time in college when someone would mess with you and dump your clothes behind the washers if you didnt move them out quickly enough sooo that pissed me off but i have to get the job done so i load up my clothes i come back in to check on drying clothes and what do i find but my dryer mysteriously switched from high heat to low heat now i am forced to put in another quarter to finish my load all in all i spent  at the econowash for  large loads i wasnt able to do my third load in the washers he had for under that i can do that much at laundry factory around the corner though so i

before i could even leave the lot it died i went back in and told him that the tow truck operator hooked it up to a jumper box and pumped the gas to start it thats what he did then told me it probably

roll out the red carpet when you are considering their apartments but once you are in and a tenant all the niceness stops they are indifferent and treat every service request conversation as if it is a legal document saying the right things in the vaguest possible manner but not following throughi was completely misled by them when i was in the market for an apartment but i know better

mention this until i gave them my advance notice i was going to vacate the apartment  they did not return my  security deposit  three years after i move out they send some delinquent account to a

working with me on refunding or possibly working out a readvertising cost kamin denied any services and left me out  dollars in the end i am glad things didnt work out since they seemed like they would be horrible landlords|this is a cut and paste from a review i wrote on apartmentratings  i read the poor reviews for kamin but decided to reserve my judgement of their places until i saw for myself i must say that after my experience today im thinking that the reviews here are far from hyperbolic i was scheduled to see two units today  one on walnut and one on s negley when my boyfriend and i arrived at the first place the building manager paul informed us that we could just look at the unit on walnut street because they are identical apartmentssame builder and everything but if you want to fight against traffic this time of day we can first of all paul the floor plan may be the same but no two units are alike the kitchen may have been updated in one or maybe the bathroom tile was different the building may smell different and maybe a potential tenant wants to see the view out the window secondly if were going to potentially sign a lease to pay almost  per month wed at least like to see the actual unit wed be living in in addition to that the other apartment was only three blocks from this building we felt that the  minute walk would not be that terrible of an inconvenience for us anyway but then again paul seemed to be in a hurry anyway we got to the first place and paul let us in rather than engage us or talk to us about the apartment he just stood there in the living room with his arms crossed and left us to wander through the apartment on our own he didnt offer any information and answered our questions with one or two word answers seriously if hes that rude now whats he going to be like when the lease gets signed strike one after we left the building on walnut the boyfriend and i walked down to s negley and met paul there he let us in and led us upstairs where he actually let a door slam right in my face what a nice guy and so gentlemanly strike two when we got to the second apartment we were wandering around when i noticed a gigantic water mark with bubbling paint and all in the corner of the ceiling in one of the bedrooms with a lovely black stain that i can only assume is mold the current tenant informed me that the roof leaked noooooow i know why paul didnt want us looking at the second unit strike three kamins out we just turned around and walked out at that point i do have to say though that paul did us a favor by being so incredibly rude unprofessional and overall kind of a tool heck maybe he hates working for kamin and this is his way of sticking it to the man if it werent for him we may have believed whatever bs story a good salesman would have given us about how theyre fixing the roof or whatnot and we may have actually bought the story and been miserable for a year how lucky for us that kamin has such a pleasant guy dealing with the public its sad though because overall the apartments would be very desirable if it werent for paul and the obviously leaking roof on to greener pasturesread more

apartment and he was very nice i would give him a  start rating its the woman who answers the phones and emails that i find extremely rude and offputting so far she has hung up on me on the phone raised her voice to me multiple times and told me to get myself a calendar when i asked to get back into my apartment during the week of memorial day i then sent an email with questions for paul because i didnt want to deal with her anymore paul never saw my email and instead she answered my long email of questions with a one word sentence if i could back out of my lease at this point i totally  would solely because of the receptionist but unfortunately i am trapped their apartments are decent but the receptionist needs to attend a few sessions of customer service training and

away  another server later stopped by to fill our water and drinks were never even offered  when amanda finally did return she was capable of answering a couple questions about portion size and our orders were placed  with my mom and sister opting for the twocourse gusto lunch and myself choosing two courses a la carte we sat and sipped our waterwaiting approximately  minutes another ancillary server arrived with bread and butter  a light and airy white bread with a hefty crust paired with a sweet and salted cows milk butter  decent but nothing to write home about compared to the myriad bread options at eleven  after this point we would not see another staff member for  minuteswell we would see them they just wouldnt be walking anywhere near our table  instead bussing tables and running around while the hostess flirted with a man at the barill note that my water glass remained empty for greater than  minutesfinished with our first courses approximately  minutes would pass  long enough for me to actively collect each and every plate and stack them at the empty seat of our fourtop  before amanda would finally return to collect the dirty plateswed not see her again until  minutes later when she filled our water glasses and told us our main courses would be right out  while i guess she didnt define right out what this actually meant was in  minutes  starting first with my mothers combo  jumbo lump crab pepper bacon avocado radish sprouts on a paesano bun and orecchiette pasta with grilled chicken dried cranberries riverview farms goat cheese sage cream while the sandwich may not be memorable the pasta was actually quite impressive  using a less salty cheese and mild cream to flavor the al dente little ears of pasta worked wonders while the sweetsavory mlange of craisins and grilled chicken were a nice matchvastly less well done than my mothers plate would be my sisters option  the grilled vegetables portobello zucchini eggplant arugula chickpea hummus on baguette and maccheretto pasta with wild mushrooms white beans sundried tomatoes rapini pesto fontina walnuts  beginning with the sandwich the bite i had was good in taste but rather mushy in consistency  too many similar vegetable textures and the hummus spread too thickly  moving on to the pasta  we all tasted it but im still not sure what we were supposed to be tasting  it tasted like watery cheeseno spice no salt and certainly nothing resembling pesto or tomatoes  for the first time in the meal amanda actually opted to check on us approximately  minutes into our main courses and when told of the watery pasta she did apologize and offered to replace it with something else  more orcchiettefor my main course i received a simple side saladfresh greens crispy onion strings and a pleasant vinaigrette  the salad of course was served alongside elysian fields lamb mac and cheese tubetti pasta mascarpone cheddar pecorinoromano and bread crumbs  piping hot and browned with crispy bread crumbs the dish was a decent macaroni and cheese but honestly the lamb was so scarce and thinly cut that it added littlecompleting our mains approximately  minutes after entering casbah we again waited nearly ten minutes before anyone would stop by to collect dirty platesa different ancillary server this time  with my mother and sister already deciding enough was enough they stood up to use the restroom before leavingby the time amanda would stop by to ask if anyone would care for dessert our two course meal had lasted  and i skipped on a menu entailing bread pudding carrot cake and panna cotta with just the billsettling the bill via credit card no tip was left because no tip was deserved  in reality amanda may have actually be the worst server ive encountered at a fine dining establishment in the last  years  i will note that when i wrote to big burrito was met by a seemingly sincere apology without excuses  the manager stated things dont normally happen like that and hed be sure the issue was addressed  he closed with i hope you will join us again i will not|overpriced salty and overrated why this place is so popular i will never understand|three strikes and youre out  we had brunch there a few months back and the meal was so salty that we could barely begin to eat it  that meal was comped and i figured it was an off day  we went back about a month later for dinner and that meal was also very salty and we could not finish it  we were willing to try again so we went for dinner tonight  i ordered the filet and it was like eating a salt shaker  i was shocked that for a third time i had a piss poor meal at casbah  i sent that back and ordered the sea bass  when i got to the end of the piece of fish it was raw  needless to say i will never return to this restaurant  looking back what should i have expected from the sister restaurant of mad mex|i have heard much about casbah being one of the best eateries in the  i went on their pasta special and got the ricotta ravioli and the short rib ravioli the ricotta was the second most expensive dish on that menu and we received two saggy bland pouches of what tasted like a microwaved lunchable the short rib was doused in a gravylike sauce that overwhelmed any taste or subtleties that may have existed heavy and bland not generally what i go out to eat for the service was also extremely slow  minutes to get our bread and  to get our appetizers|pasta fest should be called deception fest we got an email inviting us to come to pasta fest thinking it would be regular portions at a discounted price wrong it was smaller portions at a higher price i never felt so ripped off  for one meatball and three bites of pasta the server warned us about the small portion but wow  you got me this time but never again|this places reputation as a highend restaurant is entirely undeserved every single entre my party ordered was oversalted and bland and for the price i was expecting much much more if youre looking for quality food for  per plate go to meat  potatoes|i stayed at two different apartments in their  building they were good with maintenance stuff but tried to screw you over wherever they can to get the extra money from you the lady sherry who is the owners daughter and run the management company is very disrespectful especially after youve signed the leasei signed a lease stating that the apartment will be available for move in on august st and she yelled at me for asking her for the key on august st saying that i should take into account that it needs to be cleaned thats not how leases work when the lease states a movein date it literally means that i didnt have the apartment until august th but until then they only had the carpet changed the apartment was not cleaned i had to request them to give me a cleaning coupon and prorate the rent for august for me they did both but nothing makes up for the urgency i was in since my sick brother needed the apartment urgently and i had conveyed that to her before signing the lease that and the fact that she was arrogant because she knew we were pretty limited in our options also they tried to squeeze in every penny from our security deposit my exroommate had magnets on the fridge that left a couple of pink stains on it they charged us  for that the fridge worked fineif you didnt have to deal with sherry the place wont be a bad idea to stay but her attitude problem and unprofessionalism makes it really hard melita is a much more professional person to speak to but she only works for sherrythe apartments are not bad but its very poorly managed|maybe i am just the most jaded vegan in town quiet storms food menu bores me to tears that which i will use to salt my own mediocre cooking at home their coffee isnt all that great either as given the choice local la prima is in my favor tears this is the only vegetarian restaurant on the east side of town and oh so close to me but i cannot stand to go there desperate times now call for toast and tea served by the sad server that resides within my depressed little dining room|i must be a glutton for punishment because i keep finding myself hungrily returning to the quiet storm the menu has slightly changed and they are no longer cash only this time it was the th ward that inflicted extreme disappointment not sure what th ward is supposed to mean but i will forever associate it with a dry boring place and i thought we were getting a party platter this appetizer sampler included the worst hummus evaar i am near positive that they forgot to add garlic lemon salt and tahini to this chickpea paste that which was described as garlicky on the menu sooo wrong the butter another wtf of a name was also very dry and bland the salsa was good and there were plenty of dipping accessories too many really given the smallness of the unappetizing dip portionsat this point ive tried most of the vegan options qs has to offer and the only luck ive had has been with the byob go figure i wouldnt care so much about how much of a tease this place is if i didnt really desire a comfortable neighborhood place to eat comfortable food with a comfortable view of a cute waitress who writes fiction and it frustrates me that few others seem to recognize the culinary i shutter at even calling it that mediocrity of the best vegetarian restaurant pittsburgh has to offer|im a vegetarian and have lived behind the restaurant for over  years every time i have ever gone the service is awful its as if theyre doing you a favor by waiting on you i think their breakfasts are pretty good and their lentil loaf is good but usually your sides consist of yellow nacho chips with brown jalopeno slaw also the cooks look like they are lacking hygeine the one great thing about this place is their coffee and thats it|yes it is reasonably priced  yes my food was tasty  on a scale of   however the place did not look clean to mei wont be back because of that|ugh i got a plate with seisage tofu scramble and sundried tomato toast my whole plate was entirely dry chewy and unpalatable i had high hopes for the tofu scramble especially after seeing positive reviews about it but honestly it tasted like nothing i thought itd be moister with a creamy consistency that might come from silken tofu but it was hard dry and chewy hubby got a country burrito that was much better in comparison to my plate but that might have been due to the fact that his whole plate was doused in gravy anything will taste better drenched in gravy we think the gravy tastes like the powdered packet kind where you just add water on top of all this service wasnt the greatest i had to fish around for my own ketchup and they didnt even bother to ask me what kind of toast  options on the menui wanted when i ordered the toast option for my meal then they didnt bother to ask hubby if he wanted anything to drink after he had picked one of the  entrees that come with coffee or juice we had to tell someone else to get it for us also they dont really wash their cups there are  sink basins at the front where they just dunk the cups in one soapy basin then dunk the cups in a second water basin and then stack them next to the sink it made me not want to drink my water even though i was thirsty good idea but poorly executed food ive had good vegan and vegetarian food before thats consisted of a lot of fresh greens avocados and more for a vegetarian place there was nothing green on our plates this experience sadly fell enormously short of our expectations couldve eaten at kaya or meat and potatoes for the same price|worst tofu scramble ever days old cold hard inedible  sent it back and had no time to wait for another dish i cant even believe that the server let alone the  chef thought it appropriate to serve brought my  year old along had to get a high chair im able to do this just would have been nice if asked by server if we needed one|i imagine that this is the restaurant that i would make if i were  years old and knew nothing about restaurants except dining in them and what looks and sounds cool  in that it does some things right but none of the important things  it has a decent sized shop with large windows and its bright so thats good  they have good music but unfortunately we were seated right below one of what looked like two speakers in the place  its a large restaurant so in order to make it the right volume for people far away from the speaker it has to be too loud for the people close to the speaker  i know the tradeoffs of sound systems all too well  if only there was a way to solve this problem like just riffing here more speakers at a lower volumethey had a greatest hits of the thrift store type of decor and the standard shitty artists selling their paintings like at every coffee house youve ever been to  they include coffeeteajuicewhatever in the price of the brunch because like everyone i hate choices too and i definitely wanted at least one of those  im looking at the menu and its a veganveggie place so were never going to be good friends but id like to think that theres something that looks halfway decent but it all looks awful  there are two texmexranchero breakfast dishes thats at least one too many and theres only like eight choices which sounds like plenty as a number but i assure you it was not enough herei go with the egg frittata as my least bad option and it ends up tasting mostly flavorless but with a distinct stale note  it comes with a salad that is not bad but who wants a salad for breakfast  as were leaving the waiter whos been fine the whole time asks us where were from and my girlfriend answers dc  the waiter replies oh im sorry about that  now neither of us is actually born in the dc area nor do i even particularly like living there  so im not personally offended but im not sure if someone from or living in pittsburgh has solid footing to talk the business about washington dc or almost any other large city  its not like property values in pittsburgh are indicating that everyones clammoring to live there whereas in washington dc they arei was not enjoying the restaurant before that but this kid actually threw me to straight up hating it  if youre vegan and have literally no other options then i guess youre going here  if both of those conditions arent true then go anywhere else|its cheap ill say that but otherwise its bland food served by workers who mostly dont seem to notice theyre working and when they do only respond snarkily there are many better vegetarian and vegan options to choose from|i was pretty disappointed with this place i thought from the good reviews that the pizza would taste okay i went here around am on a friday so maybe their ingredients werent as fresh i ordered a medium veggie pizza with a side of fries the fries were super soggy and the pizza was pretty flavorless there are only about  seats inside so you pretty much have to take it to go which was fine with me the people working there are really nice though which is a plus overall i wouldnt go back|they have inaccurate hours posted i tried to order at  pm when yelp says they close at am and they were already closed when i told them they have inaccurate hours posted the guy on the phone said oh thats ok and hung up on me i will never be ordering from them again which is a shame since they are so close to me i immediately called pizza parma which gladly delivered to me i recommend ordering from pizza parma since they have similar menu items they post accurate hours and they dont hang up on you seriously why answer the phone|it seems like every other time i take my pets to point breeze there is an unnecessary frustration   from being berating for using their online prescription program to being misquoted prices substantially to poor customer service i just keep hoping each time will be better  although i know they love animals i suspect they love money more  dr caroline simard is an excellent vet but my last two visits have been pushed to other vets whose bedside manner is atrocious   im a  yearold  who has been taking my pets to vets since childhood and i dont understand why each visit leaves a sour taste in my mouth|refused to take my cat which had passed away for cremation cause i had not been to the clinic previously imho thats ridiculous i will not recommended anyone to ever come here|used to love the coop despite its flaws  continuous turnover especially at higher levels poor communication to customers blatantly hostilecondescending attitude from some staff   all been going on for years there was some improvement for awhile but it has gotten worse  a few individual employees are pleasant and competent but the organization overall has some serious issues with ethicstransparency   theyre actually worse than some large corporate stores in these areas  pittsburgh has many choices for healthy food  farmers markets and csas  and thats where we purchase much of our food now  suggest you do the same|the blonde woman who tuns the gym was extremely rude to us first time we went she refused yoget off the phone on a personal call to help us then she gave us the rules for the bouldering area in a rapid bored monotone compared to other climbing gyms i have gone to this gym is less safe no grigris unfriendly and more expensive definitely not worth it worst customer service ive seen in a while|worst climbing gym i have ever been to customer service was a joke wall appears as if a boy scout went ham with a few sheets of plywood back in the s and then did nothing since then holds are prehistoric and grimy setting is subpar insurance doesnt allow for people who cant belay to be belayed better off climbing the outside of the building for a good pump|pros at least theres a climbing gym in this area walls get reset oftencons ive been coming here a couple times a week for the past few months now and i have felt like some of the walls really need some padding besides the notsogreat spring board they have the walls are pretty high and the height  lack of mats retract me from climbing certain routes which is really disappointing because it ruins my climbing experience  i brought up the aforementioned lack of mats to the woman who works here and she snapped at me mats are only supposed to be under walls that are sloped i told her the wall i was talking about was sloped and she replied curtly if you dont feel comfortable climbing those walls without a mat then you shouldnt even be climbing them i was in shock is this a way you should be addressing your climbers legitimate concerns even if it isnt possible to have mats she could have at least told me in a nicer way instead of talking to me as if i knew nothing  the gym closes at pm on fridays i usually go at night until they close but the staff passive aggressively starts turning off the gym lights around pm i get it its a friday night and you want to get outta here but the business hours are until pm so let me enjoy my last ten minutes of climbing because i am paying for my climbing membership and i want to get as much climbing as i can get out of my sessions at the gym  the holds are old and covered in rubber from the shoes it would be nice if they could at least pressure wash them every once in a while  the fees are unreasonable for the customer experience we get here|the ventilation in the bouldering area is terrible please install some chalk eaters people are inhaling tons of chalk into their lungs and are going to get pneumoconiosis from climbing at your gym|i was home for the holidays and wanted to take some friends of mine climbing  theyve never belayed and dont have equipment so my hope was that we could go i could test out of the belay class and we could top rope some easy climbsdreams crushed  only people that are belay certified can even be in the top rope room  i wouldve had to pay  to test out of the certification and even if my friends wanted to take a quick lesson on how to belay its only at very specific times and you need to give advanced noticeso we bouldered  the walls are old made of smooth plywood and though the walls are a good variety you eventually end up right on top of one another  you can only top out on one tiny section everything else backs right up to another wall or and abyss  with someone who isnt super comfortable down climbing or jumping from the top i wasnt always super excited to fall when there wasnt a nice big cushion  those were only on the overhanging wallsthe place was super busy on a sunday afternoon and group after group rolled in  i understood why there were so many vb and vb routes easier than vsside note cubbies are completely separate from the bouldering area and no food or drinks are allowed inside the bouldering area  therefore your water stays in your cubby plan carefullyi expected better from pittsburgh and heard that there is a new gym coming so ill be waiting for that one before i try to climb again in da burgh|dont go i got more problems and sounds on my car after i spent  there unbelievable|ive eaten here once after having it suggested by numerous people i was totally disappointed with the service food and the place itself i will not be headed backeversave your money or starve either would be a better option|this was the first time for me and my wife at the celebrated cafe zinho parking in the residential area in which the restaurant is located is next to impossible on a busy saturday night the diner should be prepared to walk a distance to get to the restaurant from where he or she is ultimately able to park  the greatest drawback is that the restaurant is tiny and the seating so tight that at our table it was necessary to sit uncomfortably in order to avoid being bumped by anyone that walked by which happened repeatedly as we were in a busy thoroughfare of food delivery  no other table offered a much better situation and all others were occupied at the busy time we arrived  p m the online menu boasts of a daily vegetarian and vegan special entree but there was no such entree on this night  there was only one nonmeat item on the small menu ravioli  our gracious server ramon said that the kitchen could prepare a couscous and vegetable dish if the vegetarian in our party wanted it and that was what we did  the restaurant permits customers to bring their own alcoholic beverages a nice convenience and savings for the diner  a small portion of bread was served with a tiny amount of rockhard butter  my mushroom and cheese soup was a large portion served piping hot which was great but it was a puree with no distinct mushroom pieces  i would not have been able to distinguish it as mushroom soup  all of our entrees were attractively presented and were tasty average size portions  all were served with a small amount of good fresh vegetables it would be helpful if the menu offered some description of the following entree so that the diner with an interest in a chicken dish would not have to inquire about it of the server  chicken maputoroasted w piri piri  chocolate scented sauce  does the average diner know what maputo and piri piri are the lemon tart dessert was a small piece not suitable for sharing served with two minute pieces of strawberries and a small dollop of whipped cream  it was not flavorful or moist nor worth the calories  the gracious owner tony pais stopped at our table for a moment to greet us a nice touch and there were quality checks by a manager and ramon  i noticed a number of prominent people from the community dining here individuals whom i was surprised were willing to spend a good deal of money to be packed into a sardine can of a restaurant  apparently they consider this to be the only restaurant in town  the rest rooms are small oneperson facilities naturally an unfortunate surprise occurred when the individual that was picking up the check for my party presented his credit card only to be told that the restaurant accepts only cash and checks this for a tariff of  plus gratuity  it is supposed to be of some consolation that there is an automatic teller machine on site  i imagine less than  of expensive restaurants today are cash only  cafe zinho is a highly flawed restaurant demonstrating that there is more to a fine dining experience than simply offering fine cuisine  if one is able to get beyond the feeling one has when visiting the rest room on a commercial airliner the diner might enjoy it not usi posted comments about the restaurant at its facebook page in which i noted my displeasure with being cramped and uncomfortable and about the restaurant being unique in its unwillingness to accept credit cards for a  check  an individual identifying himself as the manager who apparently had never received constructive criticism from anyone initially demonstrated rage posting a message that i can go to the oiive garden the next time i dine out  he later added with similar condescension that i can use a coupon and a credit card at the olive garden  later he thought better of his outburst and removed the commentsalong with mine  he ultimately offered me and my wife the opportunity to return to the restaurant at his expense  i thanked him for the offer but told him that one experience at cafe zinho was enough  i had no intention of returning even if he had responded to my comments like a gentleman|these people could not care less i am still waiting for my washer dryer to get fixed its been almost a month now and i am being told that they dont even know when the technician will return the technician has been here  times already each time there is supposedly something else wrong and so they have to order another part miraculously the part is wrong first week they forgot to order the second part nd week part comes in but they need a suppossed other part and it will be another  daysrd week fourth week rolls by and they dont know when its coming in thats up to the distributor when i ask for an eta because i am wearing dirty clothes and i am sick of technicians coming back  times and i already took off a week of work to meet these people the cust service rep gets mad at me and offers me a refund the washer is on warranty they obviously dont want to deal with any problems they created so now i have to call the distributor to see when the part is coming in yup  thats your job appliance service center|repairman arrived at my home without the necessary parts to do the repair  not a huge deal except i work an hour away from my home so its a problem when i take time off and dont get the intended result  when i called for the estimate the next week they informed me that the part had already been orderedwhen in fact it hadnt  they called back to say that they did not order the part and it would be x dollars  not only did they charge more than they quoted they installed a black handle on a stainless refrigerator  very rude when i called them out on it and then lied about it  they said they spoke to my husband about the increase in price and installing the wrong color because the stainless wasnt available who in their right mind would pay  for the wrong color handle  do not trust them|and sothe search for a new hair salon continues sigh dont get me wrong the cut was a good cut the salon itself was clean and stylish the owner welcoming and friendly now what went wrong the cut was good but it certainly wasnt what i expected from a salon with the reputation of izzazu i wasnt bowled over by my stylists professionalism either dont diss my previous stylistshe rockedyou dont do yourself any favors by knocking someone else  and come on i was waaayyyy overdue for a cut since ive been driving to cleveland for a style  that being said for  and saving big bucks on gas tolls lunch and shopping the cut was still a deal but when i started to sign the charge slip it said  not  but i said the website said it was  for a master stylist oh the chick at the counter said thats for mens cuts silly me so when i got back to the office i went online and checked nope it said  for a master stylist womens haircut hmmmmm so i called the chick at the counter now said oh our stylists charge whatever they feel the cut should be what so i quoted the prices to her from the izzazu website she changed her tune again oh wellill refund you  if you give me your credit card number didnt she have my slip with the card number sorry i dont give my credit card number over the phone or i can send you a gift certificate nope i said through clenched teeth i wont be coming backit wasnt the cut it was the bait and switch id gladly have paid it had they been up front and aboveboard ahead of time as judge judy says dont pee on my leg and tell me its raining the search goes on or ill be back in cleveland in the spring for the next cutp s  one amusing side note  i checked in at izzazu when i arrived  turns out im the duchess  the duchess is displeased|sadly the professionalism of the front desk never got better  despite emilios assurances that changes were being made my latest visit proved otherwise  i called ahead and was assured that marshall was on timein fact he didnt have an appointment ahead of mine and could take me as soon as i got there  i was there a few minutes before my appointment  i waited  and waited  fifteen minutes later i asked if marshall knew i was waiting  i was told by the brunette that they had been busy  odd she the blonde and two other employees had been standing there talking for a while  she went back to notify marshall  when marshall came up front to get me the brunette admonished him that he should keep an eye out for his clients  she shouldnt have to notify him that his appointment is there  wow  and the purpose of a receptionist iswhat  im done  im out  apparently nothing will help izzazus but getting rid of the front desk staff  on a positive note it was another great cut  not good enough to lure me back though|awful facial with lulu used a groupon and thought it may be why she was so terribly unattentive but realized she had no idea what i was paying with basically i got the steam machine blowing on my face for  min  would give negative stars if i could|i had an appointment that was made  months in advance and when i turned up they told me that the person i had the appointment with quit  weeks ago and they didnt have anyone available to take me they made no attempt to reschedule me with someone else or call me to cancel to make things worse the battleax at the front desk had such an attitude heres a tip when you are in the beauty salon business staff the front desk with someone who looks like they have actually been to a salon not with rude women that have hairdos from  years ago will never go back|emailed and called several times to get a pricing on having several services done at once as a graduation present to myself i was put on hold twice and never picked back up emails went unanswered  i was going to have so much done too hair cut color with highlights spa manicurepedicure and an hour massage all as a graduation present to myself but if they cant be attentive to prospective customers then i cant imagine that theyd be attentive in the store ill spend my money elsewhere|unbelievable experience literally unbelievable i waited  minutes and finally walked out receptionists were beyond awful i booked  style appointments in advance for a wedding one person was taken right away  minutes later the second person was taken  i waited  minutes while being ignored by the receptionists  i can celled because the others were almost done and we would be running late my stylist finally came out and said hed quickly do my hair what  im not paying  to get rushed service we were looking forward to a relaxing fun experience more unbelievable i waited  minutes to pay for the two services one receptionist couldnt take transactions and another was occupied with a wedding party  i was so close to walking out and not paying unfortunately the two stylists didnt get a tip through no fault of their own i cant give an unbiased opinion of their work as i am still furious in the way i was treated  i would expect some ambiance at  for shampoo  style i could never recommend izzazu denham  company is on market square their rates are reasonable and within walking distance of the fairmont i am calling the concierge tomorrow informing her of my experience|i wanted to find a new place and tried the wexford location since i live nearby after seeing a coupon for a haircut omg i have an appointment this weekend to get my hair fixed though it will be hard to do because i went in for a trim and i lost about  inches of hair and it is still uneven my part which was on the left is now kinda zig zagged and my hair sticks up and out all over i asked often about the hair being cut and i was told it was not much length but helping to get rid of the volume i have thick hair yea well  inches cut with my hair wet is now over  inches dry because of how curly my hair is which i mentioned oh i dont know maybe  times bc she kept asking me about doing a treatment to straighten it  no wonder they need coupons for customers and i still tipped her because how bad i felt for her because she was telling me how poor she is because of her divorce i should have just walked out when i was left waiting for over  minutes without anyone saying a word about it|i arrived for my appointment at  oclock on time and after sitting and waiting for half an hour was told that the stylist was running behind and it would be at least another half an hour until she could get to me i guess her time or the current customers time was more important than mine i didnt stay to find out how the haircut would have gone|okay i had heard and read about this place since moving to this side of town and finally came big waste of time and gas they do not have ice cream only soft serve well i ordered butter pecan ice cream and what do they bring me vanilla wow are their servers just lazy or dumb|this place isnt very good i ordered a sundae and asked for a flavored ice cream but was told they could only do chocolate or vanilla because of how they mix it  its a sundae so no mixing is involved so i dont understand that then when i got it it was missing half the toppings that were listed in the description definitely not as good as people claim wont be going back|horrible  they use chicken thats been out uncover all day  and they smoke around the food|the menu online gives no prices and the entrees are ridiculously overpriced for what you get  a good meal but far too much food and nothing extraordinary the entrees are    be warned  if you want atmosphere to go with your  entree youd better request downstairs otherwise you can have your anniversary dinner in a small room in front of large televisions who knew and the staff will definitely not accommodate your request for a more romantic spot  even if they know it is your tenth anniversary wow should have walked out|no better in taste than a fazoli or even an olive garden  inflated prices like the cheapest entree was  try to disguise this place as something it is not  went with a group of co workers so we pretty much got everything on the menu and not one thing stuck out really good  service is incredibly slow  not worth it at all  even if you tell yourself that atleast the portions are large the food is just not good enough to warrant wasting a meal eating there|the first time i went here was with a group  we had reserved the entire restaurant for a retirement party   i had a horrible experience  vowed never to go back  at that time i even had a terrible interaction with the ownerthis time i was invited with a couple of girlfriends because they love it decided to try again since it was more about the get together than the foodlocationthis time overpriced food and bad service  overall it was not anything out of the ordinary and not worth the price   i had the veal speciality   large portion but ok  staff was not very attentive for the small amount of customers presenti am a pittsburgh native  this is a bad neighborhood i am not interested in ever going back|there was a wonderful staff that i would go for to my surprise the last time i went i was disappointed the wonderful staff he had was gone i was not happy with my last experience and it was not as homey and family oriented as it was before food wasnt that great either not happy about the new staff also over heard the owner using racial slurs and provocative terms that just made my stomach turn for these reasons i will not be returning|this is the worst chinese food i have had in a long time the crab rangoon was clunky and too thick there was no crab on the insideit was all cream cheese the egg roll i had was dripping grease and was filled with cabbage and nothing else there were no other veggies or anything the sesame chicken was mushy by the time i got home and i live  minutes away it was all mushy breading and very little chicken i ate  bites and threw it away this meal was an epic fail|they are never open on sundays even though they are supposed to be i am starting to think maybe they folded and are out of business|yesterday i had the misfortune of getting a pizza from bishops it was my first time getting a pizza from there in a long time needless to say i wont be getting one again i got a pepperoni and sausage pizza the pizza was bland  tasteless crust tasted like frozen pizza crust the sauce was meh cheese was okay sausage was disgusting bishops used to use a delicious hot sausage i dont know what this sausage was other then disgusting i dont recommend getting a pizza from bishops|the customer service is absolutely horrible they made me wait an hour before anybody got to me and there were  available beauticians in the back i complained and got waited on right away i thought the customer always came first why would they want to risk a customer not coming back i mean i can just go down the road to borics these women are old middle aged miserable employees with no passion for their jobs i wont be back disappointed|ive only had one experience at frank  shirleys which was enough to be my last i didnt even get to sit down before i was disgusted by this place while waiting to be seated a man came from the kitchen with a toilet plunger in hand and went to unclog the toilet afterwards without washing his hands or anything walked back into the kitchen still carrying the plunger dripping the entire way i was absolutely horrified i will never ever consider going back there|im in the market for a fun little scooter to have fun and commute on and at the suggestion of a friend i went to bohn cycle shop to check out what they had in the shop immediately upon walking in it took  minutes for someone to ask if we were helped when i mentioned that i wanted to learn more about a zuma over in the corner the dude at the desk was disinterested and unhelpfulwhen i tried to pay for the scooter and roll it out an older woman stewed around and gave me annoyed looks for coming into the store and not calling ahead when i tried to pay with a bankissued check i had to wait around for nearly  minutes before they told me that they have never seen a bankissued check and sent me on my waythe entire time i was there it felt like they thought i just stole a bunch of money and were treating me like a crook i am definitely not going back to complete the transaction if im going to be buying an expensive piece of machinery i really expect the service to at least be a little more enthusiasticlike nick t said i guess its a good place if you wanna grab a used bike or know exactly what you want if youre looking to broker a new bike go to a bigger shop with salesmen that actually sound like theyre living beings|do not go here for service on your bike i dropped my bike off for an oil change after calling ahead of time am they told me there was no one ahead of me for service i called back at the end of the day only to be told my bike couldnt get looked at until the next day when i questioned as to why my oil change wasnt done if they didnt have other services ahead of mine the very rude and incompetent guy who runs their service department told me i was busy with other stuff from now on i will be taking my business elsewhere because this place is a joke|maybe i just had a bad day  this was the worst pizza ive ever had  i have had original dicarlos in wheeling wv in several locations  this is not even worthy of the name  i got  extra cheese  first off the pizza was basically glued to the wax paper  the crust was unevenly cooked  first bite the crust was almost raw dense and way too chewy  the sauce tasted sour and the cheese shredded not dices provolone like the original was slimy  my second bite the crust was burned tasted burned but at least it was crunchy  there was no third bite  the remaining slices got tossed in the garbage  this was by far the worst pizza ive ever had|do not do business with this company the owner is a thief he will send pink notices that look like bills and instead they are service packs he attempts to get you to enroll the service is awful follow up on issues is non existentthe company will give you a  day notice and suspend your pos license for even questioning an invoice and shut down your entire business the techs are part time and walk out of your business if they cant address an issue and push it to another part time tech save yourself the aggravation i have future pos and bought the licenses so im stuck and go direct to the dealer in butler pa this companys the worst and cant even keep employees they do have  techs that have been with the company one more incompetent the the otheryou have been warned|if zero was an option that is what i would rate them they are the worst company to ever deal with all they want is money i called tec support to get my back office unlocked and they said it would be  i already bought the system for |zero if that was an opinion worst pos company in pittsburgh deal with cutting edge solutions in butler or any other pos company other than ncraloha|i am kind to all service workers always this place has the worst service i have ever seen i do not expect four star treatment from fast food but this place is ridiculous you better check your bag because they are going to forget something yesterday my husband went to get a quickie family fish dinner he was told that no sorry we are out of hushpuppies and pepsi okay thats fine but what can we have to replace the hushpuppies he was told to go down the street there is a store this is inside not the drive thru it seems that this is a common experience at this restaurant i already sparingly frequent fast food establishments but this will definitely be the last attempt and yes i have contacted the corp i dont want anything from them though they can keep it|not very good very disappointed|very disappointed wouldnt recommend at all got a large pizza the quality was horrible the sauce was not a good flavor at all i had to wait  hours just for a pick up for this crap their pizza box was more like a diaper the pizza bagels were soggy yet burned the employees looked like a bunch of drug addicts hanging out and the prices too high biggest waste of money|i came and left after seeing all the changes i was here to check out the place after the hospital mentioned it was a cool bar  i think all the hype from my colleagues was not justifiednot a great menu just a boring bar  its a shame what happened i was looking forward to a great place to hang out eat and chug beers|this place is a dump being new to pittsburgh we bought a bunch of groupons to try new places in town we decided to check out the park house for a bite to eat and a few drinks what a joke even though the groupon included menu items they dont have a kitchen they have a microwave on the bar and all of their food choices are microwave gross and its a dirty sketchy bar on the corner of east ohio and cedar never again  they can keep the other groupon maybe they can use the money to buy some real food|this place is pretty terrible but it is the only place to get gas in the area its always overcrowded and the receipts never print|i developed my  film here the other day and they charged me an extra  dollars a roll for no reason  on the website they say  but they charged me   the owner is very pretentious and rude  when i told him that it says  dollars online he didnt care at all  when i dropped my film off the high school kid didnt even tell me the price because it is too much for me to calculate  also the photo equipment darkroom equipment and film are way over priced  i am never going back to this place  i strongly urge everyone to never enter or deal with bernies photo  rather use the websites of companies like bh adorama or calumet  the have much better customer service and better prices  very disappointed that this is the only photo store in the city|went in to buy a cold shoe adapter in a pinch on my way to a shoot he charged me  for the same exact item that sells for  at bh i bought it without thinking as i was stressing on the way to a gig but was furious when i thought about it in the carunfortunately this is the only game in town makes me glad i live in new york city you would think a store in a dying industry would thrive to provide better customer service pretty much the only reason why i would go to a small store rather than a big one they dont even offer that|just stopped in to see about selling my canon rebel t to buy a d that they dont have in stock because its old i was offered  for my t that is currently being sold online for over  i asked why such a low price and was told that since it was an older model it wasnt worth as much needless to say i walked out with my t sucks that this is the only camera shop in pittsburgh|despite living in pittsburgh for most of my life ive somehow managed to never eat at maxs allegheny tavern until recently  my initial impression of the restaurant was positive  the place had an old neighborhood feel to it a small crowd was drinking at the end of the antique hardwood bar and the german murals on the walls made me crave an icycold german lager with a stout head of foam  i thought about how well german potato salad would taste with that beer  so i grabbed a seat at the bar and eagerly awaited the first taste of my beerand i waitedand waitedand waited some more  for over  minutes before someone came around to take the order  actually that isnt quite accurate  two employees came around  one to the end of the bar and one behind the bar directly opposite me  both of them stared at me  neither one greeted me or asked me what i would have like to order  i stared back incredulously and even made a whats going on here palmsextendedupwardshouldershrug gesture  neither one took the hintfinally a third employee came around the bar and took my order  great i thought to myself finally that beer  she served the beer in a mason jar  wtf  who serves imported german lager at a german restaurant in a freaking mason jar  maxs does  the beer was devoid of its head likely the result of a bad beer pour andor a less than perfectly clean glass an endemic problem with pittsburgh restaurants in my observation  i was sad  i quaffed my beer quickly in an attempt to salve my irritation and opened the menumy first impression of the menu can be summed as follows uhoh  the menu is huge with a number of slowfood stews and braises  the restaurant is more than halfempty  how can a restaurant prepare such a large number of menu items including more than a few laborintensive dishes freshly every day and still stay in business when the place isnt even halffull  answer they cant  the food isnt freshi ordered the wiener schnitzel  i love properly prepared wiener schnitzel  made with fresh butterflied veal breast slightly pounded and seasoned wellcoated in fresh bread crumbs and panfried in clarified butter until golden brown on the outside and juicy on the inside wiener schnitzel is the ultimate comfort food  sadly maxs wiener schnitzel had nothing to do with properly prepared schnitzel  the veal was superthin had a texture that strongly suggested it had been mechanically processed and tasted as if it was prebreaded and frozen  it wasnt pan fried either  the breaded frozen puck was simply dropped into a fryolater  where the breading puffed out and fell off of the meat in places which doesnt happen when the cutlet is resting against the cooking surface under its own weight as when the dish is properly panfried  the edges of the sad schnitzel had curled up and it looked a horrible mess on the plate  curly schnitzel  my stomach droppedmy sides german potato salad and braised red cabbage were equally awful  the german potato salad had an unnatural glossy sheen  the kind that typically comes from bottled sauces that contain high fructose corn syrup  the bacon in the dressing was nothing more than tiny flecks of some sort of processed possibly faux meat  the potatoes were suspiciously uniform in thickness and roundness  exactly the homogeneity that is found in prepeeled presliced vacuumsealed processed potatoes  it was a gluey sickly sweet mess  i didnt have more than a bite or two  the braised red cabbage didnt taste fresh  it tasted like it had been sitting in a steam table for a day or two and my order was its last chance to be eaten  maxs allegheny tavern bills itself on their web site as the best in german fare  the best in servicethats total bullshit  its awful  both for service and fareif you want good authentic german fare in which the schnitzel is properly panfried to order and delicious join the teutonia mannerchor down the street  ill never return|i must of been eating at another maxs in a pararell universefood was terriable service was worse went and got sushi|my husband and i have been to this restaurant many times over the past  years and went for sandwiches tonight sorry to say it was the worst food we have ever eaten at this place reuben sandwich was greasy and had little meat sweet potato fries were not edible we ate at a table at the bar and told andy our bartender but got zero satisfaction since weve had such a bad experience and no effort by the restaurant to remedy a bad meal be warned|i wasvery disappointed in the food if you want bland tasteless food then stop here they need to get out of the s with the decori ordered the corned beef and cabbage sandwich it was edible but not enjoyable dont waste your money here there are much better choices|not a fan of this german place simply awful we ordered the potato pancake reuben and a traditional reuben so much gristle in the meat very low quality food for the price the bar is cool have stopped here in the past and enjoyed the atmosphere of the bar bar yesfoodrestaurant no|terrible service i will not be visiting this place again the owner gave me a serious attitude when i asked to pay for my order of  sandwiches in  different payment methods there were a few people at my work that asked them to pick up lunch for them as well he told me that doesnt split orders i advised him i have been coming there for years and have always taken orders for my coworkers and giving him more business i find it very hard to believe this is the first time someone has stopped in and asked to split an order up the cleanliness of the deli has also gone downhill i ordered ahead and still waiting  minutes past the time quoted for pick up the owner grossly mishandled the situation i was polite and patient so to receive that response i was completely taken aback|i really wanted to like this place great reviews and a renovated priorywhat a great idea the pictures on the website are beautifulwe found a grumpy old man at the front desk and he could not have been less interested in our arrival it felt like we were disturbing him to ask for our room key but the fun started when we returned later in the evening we found the rollaway we had requested and paid for not present and i went back down to the old gentleman he stared at me and then went back to pecking at his computer i waited suddenly he looked up at me and started yelling something to the effect that there wasnt anything that he could do and that he would see if someone could do something but probably not he also angrily admitted that the reservation did show the rollawayi slunk away with my guest who had by now come down too embarrassed and insulted it shouldnt be this way if this is personalized service id rather stay at a moteleven without grumpy old man theres nothing special about this place the rooms were ok but the bathrooms tiny i guess they should be called showerrooms everything else was subpar the dining room breakfast was served in was tacky and the coffee awful we did not dare try the free wine the hotel is in a bad neighborhoodfor the money find a special at the william penn on the omni hotels website if you want a boutique hotel try the inn on the mexican war streetsa beautiful building with friendly owners just across from the national aviary and that beautiful park the priory does not feel boutique and is not worth the hasslepriory get grumpy old man out of a customerfacing role|we stayed here and was initially disappointed being new to town our first impression was that pittsburgh was a very very bad town full of homeless and degenerates the area i find out later is one of the worst spots in the city  the hotel is located across the street from a housing authority building  projects  ugh  great  then we were put into a historical room that was similar to that of a rundown cheap apartment old shower stall moldy threadbare carpeting lumpy squeaky bed  i find out an hour later after freaking out about the loend aspect of this room that they have new rooms that were just recently renovated  i asked to see the room and then ultimately change to that room for a fee of course  about  more expensive  but i pay more because no way would i be able to exist in this old historical creepy room  finally a regular room the renovated room was similar to that of an acceptable hotel room  why even keep this historical old dingy dirty room  do they figure unsuspecting people who dont know any better will just accept it bc they have no other choice i slept well in the new renovated room and would have been freaked out all night in the old room what a difference actually the bed and linens were very very comfortable  the bathroom was nice and clean  the room was what i expected a hotel room to be not high end four seasons but not cheap and nasty either the hotel obviously had availabilities of the new renovated rooms so why put us in an old unrenovated ugly old apartment looking room if they believed in upgrading then they would have at least gotten repeat business for those who are going to book here pay more for the new rooms or go somewhere else  the option of staying in the old room should not be an option at all  i dont think i will ever go back here if i ever go back to pittsburgh  i will stay at a chain hotel marriot or whatever  what is money except a means to be comfortable and live  i will spend more next timebreakfast was eh  it was free small stations of some fruit cheese small pastries cereal yougurt and two hot items  sausage  bacon  oj cranberry milk and coffee also available  honestly i felt like i was in college and watching my pennies poor staying here|was at a beautiful wedding  staff was terrible unpleasant and the two slobs at the front desk need to be in the back with their people skills  nice hotel but make sure you take some warm bodies with you because the people at the priory are cold miserable and just plain miserable i get better guest service at holiday inn|we decided to have a little staycation at the priory earlier this month  my husband made the reservation with a special they were having for a dinner date night  with the special they give you a few pittsburgh restaurants to choose from and you get a  voucher to that restaurant  when my husband called the priory they said they would make the reservations and call us back on the time  we never got a call about the reservation time which was annoying  but the main issue was we checked in talked to the girl at the front desk about having the shuttle take us to this reservation at meat and potatoes and she set us up with the shuttle  we go in the room look around for the  voucher and its not in the room so we assumed i know we should never assume that it was taken care of with meat and potatoes when they  made our reservation  we had a fabulous dinner at mp great food great service and the bill comes  we asked the server about this priory  voucher and he had never heard about it so the manager comes over and says they didnt give them anything but to have them call and ask for him and hell work it out  we called the priory and told them this the girl who answered gave us an attitude and said you should have asked for it  then refused to call mp to talk to the manager  she just said to pay the full bill and we can work it out when we get back to the hotel  we gave the manager our phone and he was yelled at as well about this  he took our word that the priory would deliver it to him the next day and he deducted the  from our bill  it was embarrassing and it wasnt the issue with the money just the service with the priory  this showed us two things we wont be going back to the priory due to the lack of service and lack of respect and we will be going back to mp because their service was impeccable|horrible food horrible service im really not sure how this place manages to stay in business|i hate to post anything negative  but seriously this place was one of the worst  we werent expecting top of the line anythingbut everything about this place was bad  the place was pretty dirty the coffee was like water we waited close to an hour for our food apparently the cook decided to leave for about  minutes the waitressowner was more interested in drinking beers with another set of customers at  in the morning than checking on us  the food was beyond badohand ice cold  the waitress the one time she came over literally spilleda good amount of coffee on our table and just walked back to her drinking buddies  it was like getting a shitty breakfast in a local sub dive bar|rons pizza palace is cheap if the only requirement for your meal is that it costs less than  rons still wouldnt be your best optiontoday i ordered an antipasta sic salad that came with wilted lettuce thinly sliced low quality deli meat rotting carrots and an overabundance of some shredded white cheese the entire combination filled slightly more than one quarter of the styrofoam container it came inon multiple occasions in the past i have ordered hoagies from rons while i have had enjoyable hoagies from rons that is not the standard experience the hoagies are very inconsistent in terms of quality occasionally good frequently bad if you get a hoagie i dont recommend one with produce on it the produce in their hoagies is as bad as their saladsi wont be ordering from rons again despite the inexpensive menu im all for a cheap meal but only if a certain standard of quality is met with rons you are better off considering fast food|was going to try the buffalo pizza tried to call about  pm saturday night and they didnt even pick up the phone theyer menu says that they are open til pm  disappointed again no longer going to try|i really dont know how this place got any good reviews one big problem is that the place is dirty the carpets the lighting above the tables and the furniture i have tried this place  times in the past  years and this is how it went the st time i had a burger which tasted funny and i didnt finish it i got food poisoning and was so sick this i thought might have been a stomach flu so i did try this place again the nd time i was with some friends from the neighborhood and  of us had the spaghetti and meatballs and we got food poisoningnow im thinking that they have a hygiene problem with the ground meat i was going to stay away from the place but a friend from troy hill liked to stop there because it was close to her home no problemnext time i got french fries with gravy how could this be a problemwhen they got to the table they had put cold canned gravy on my frieswhen i told the waitress about it she took it back to the kitchen and microwaved it till it was the heat of lava needless to say i refused to pay for them the th time my friend dragged me there i had a salad i didnt get sick but it wasnt anything special with bagged salad mix and a couple of under ripe tomato pieces and cucumber the last time i only got a slice of pie and this was good i no longer have to go to billys my dear friend has passed away and i refuse to go anywhere near the place to the ownerplease sell the restaurant you obviously dont care for the place or know how to handle food safely|well my update is that this place has been sold and new owners are going to give it a shot i am excitedly awaiting a grand opening for the new place my first hope is that they will steam clean the whole place to start i will try it no matter what kind of place it is because i try to support local businesses|how to put this gentlywhile i may go back to pittsburgh some day i will never return to the carnegie museum of art its not that i mind that its gallery seemed small compared to others i have viewed sometimes small museums have some hidden treasures or that one whole gallery was blown glass and i felt like i was at a bong shop on haight st in sf it comes down to the fact that a docent while trying to explain a painting with a watchtower in it told the students it was a watchtower from auschwitz a place where they basically fried a lot of jews  seriously thats how she chose to describe concentration camps to a large class of what i could only guess were middle schoolers it sounded like she described a bad breakfast jointoh that place they basically just fry eggson top of all that the description of the piece stated the watchtower was reminiscent of those that were spread throughout east and west germany during hitlers rule ie not those in auschwitzin sum docents are a reflection of the institution in which they volunteer and this one sucked so carnegie museums of pittsburgh if youre going to hire racist people to lead your tours at least make sure they have their facts straight or can read|at this point i am done i scheduled my kids for the last  weeks in august and then due to an emergency i had to cancel which i did a month before their camp was to start i was told they were issuing my refund and that was  weeks ago three weeks and i still dont have it i live probably  minutes from the museum and could have driven there  times by now and picked it up its just sooo unprofessional and annoying they need to get their office together and deliver refunds in a timely manner  business days are fine but  weeks is unacceptable for it to not have even been mailed yet so dissapointed and will never use them again|in response to the response i received from the museum rep i called and left a message and never received a reply as of yet but you reponded on yelp this week is the rd week your response stated that my refund was sent this week if you are speaking about this current week today is the th monday and the week has just begun if you are talking about last week can you please tell me what day since leaving messages do not gain a response except to be contacted here on yelp thank you|estimated delivery time  minutes actually delivery time  minutespizza hut  a pizza of last resort|delivery time was  called at  to check on my order and was told it was just going in the oven and would be another  minutes to an hour until it was delivered told them to just cancel the order and they got an attitude with me about it not to mention in the past they couldnt even bring me my entire order|estimated delivery time from an online order  min called to make sure it was actually out for delivery guy says our estimated delivery time is actually  hours i shouldve just picked up an hour ago dont bother with delivery here carry out is your best bet|complete and total joke terrible service terrible management terrible product do yourself a favor avoid this place because of the fact this pizza hut is allowed to exist by pizza hut standard and be the complete shit hole that it is for years i vow to never consume pizza hut ever again|if i could give this restaurant a zero i would we were just asked by our waitress to leave because someone with a reservation was waiting for our table my father and fatherinlaw were still finishing up their coffee and we had not yet finished our dessert ive never been so humiliated do not go to this restauranttheir food was mediocre at best if you want excellent italian in a small intimate restaurant go to dish on the south side i will not be going back|went for the first and last time tonight made reservations for  restaurant thought we said  and acted like we lied  corkage fee for  bottle of wine asked to leave when we finished eating because they needed the table on a thursday night food was ok but not even close to making up for all the other problems i can easily get a good meal elsewhere for those prices with better service|the best thing about this place is sam the worst thing about this place is also samwhat was great was that sam made me feel at home and treated me like someone he had known for a long time he took me to the back of his warehouse gave me a free beer to drink and engaged me in plenty of conversation at one point though he said you look oriental but you also look american im pretty sure he wasnt meaning for it to be offensive and i just discounted it as his being an old man who didnt know it was no longer politically correct to say things like thatthis is not why i recommend against carusos however the reason why ill never go there again is because sam knowingly sold me expired beeri was on my way back from the north side to the east end where i live and after seeing these good reviews i decided to stop by i wanted a case of yuengling but sam said why dont you try this instead and popped open a fresh bottle of castello an italian beer he had me drink it all the while espousing its comparative taste to yuengling at a cheaper price point it certainly tasted alright and a case of it was a couple dollars less than what yuengling was going forsince the castello tasted fine i ended up buying a case of it on sams recommendation a few days later when i opened the box and drank a couple of the beers however i noticed that they tasted funny thats when i looked at the label and saw how each of the bottles had its sell by date marked out in black sharpie you could see the numbers underneath the sharpie and the dates were for well over two years ago so basically sam had convinced me to buy something he hadnt been able to sell knowing that i lived in the east end and probably wasnt going to visit again anywaystale beer aside theres another big reason not to go to carusos their prices are steep for a case of yuengling while sam might be a more charming character than the young folks at my neighborhood distributor pistellas at least i know that pistellas has significantly lower prices and actually has enough customers and product turnover that they wont purposely sell me something thats not fresh|the most dysfunctional subway i have ever been to  i am in outside sales and eat at subway at least once a week throughout the pittsburgh area and surroundingi ordered a tuscan chicken salad and you would have thought i asked them to paint the sisteen chapel  the fountain drinks are cheapened by less syrup and more soda water  the sweet tea is also cheapened with hardly any sugarthe only redeeming quality is the young girl who works here  she is very polite even when asking a peer for help with ringing up my order  the peer got all up in arms about how they never trained them to do that  the young girl politely asked for a moment sought out who i believe to be the ownermanager and came back promptly with a solutioni dont expect much from subway to begin with and this location is a far cry from bare minimum|does not honor national sub day offer they tell you just as you are about to pay too late to back out wtf|awful  i didnt know how bad it was until i went to a different ge and saw how good it could be  the lines are long the produce selection is minimal and the store is overcrowdedthe last straw was yesterday when the cashier blew her nose stuck kleenex up her nose then put it back in her pocket and continued to scan groceries  when i complained to the manager they denied any of their employees were sickim done shopping at this store|this giant eagle maybe the worst supermarket ive ever been to there are thugs hanging out by the entrance and in the parking lot the interior is dark and dank and has an outdated made in the s feel with options like this i dont have a problem taking the extra time to drive to trader joes|scariestshadiest grocery store experience in my life hubby and i pulled in only to see a few cars down people selling whoknowswhat out of their car trunk also this is the only giant eagle tht gives you a really hard time if you ever forget your advantage card and give your phone no instead it works at the other ones just fine then we leave by waiting for a really dazedswaying woman to finish wandering around back and forth in front of us and pass by a driveby fat cash exchange drugs on our way out of the parking lot we are definitely scared to return and will never need grapes or any other groceries so desperately again|the store reeks of rotting fish the security guards watch you like a hawk and the food selection is the worse ive seen in any giant eagle in the cityone plus if you must shop here there are plenty of jitney drivers waiting for you to come out to offer you a ride  that can be a big help if you are like me and dont have a car need a car haha some things about living in the hood just never change with this being the closet g e to downtown and pnc park and heinz field i would think they would renovate but its been years and still no change|awful  worst grocery store ive ever been to  to make it worse they are supposed to open at   at  i was told they were still getting ready to open and i should come back around |the store has a weird rotting meat smell sometimes the selection isnt amazing but there are a few interesting items here as other people commented there are always people hanging around outside but they are friendly at least to me one thing i like about the store is the proximity to my house the biggest let down is the sky high prices that i think ge is notorious for i miss kroger|so i got a call from giant eagle asking me to give my opinion of this store my recommendation was to burn this place to the ground buckle up for crappy produce rotten fish old meat and security guards that speck you be stealin this is the ghto eagle|it smells funky in here  on a positive note its usualy fully stocked and there is an indoor redbox my debit card numbers were hacked by a skimmer at the shadyside get go every last dollar was spent in  hour at a bed bath  beyond so i barely use redbox and if i do it has to be at an indoor location like this one the skimming can still happen but i feel a little more at easeoh and their check cashing system is hit or miss its different from other ges so they use their own system the last two times we were here the system declined bobbys check waste of time i dont even bother coming here anymore all bad news|went to this store today and it was worse than usual  jitneys were all parked up in the handicapped parking spaces because it was raining the one guy was walking back to his car next to me and as he pulled his keys out of his pocket a baggie corner filled with some brown stuff fell out right in front of me i had seen him pocket something from a man that sits at the driveway exit he did pick it up really fast then i saw a young man in a tie from the store go over to the guy that was selling this stuff and they shook hands and were laughing and yacking with each other  this is in the middle of the day im too scared to shop there after dark|the problem with this dry cleaner is poor counter service  i have never been treated in such a poor manner  and the sad part is that this service provider doesnt care  i recommend going elsewhere  they are not worth my money|so i take my s to pfennigs cleaners on the north dide in pittsburgh the way i have for  years not every week but when i know its time to get them dry cleaned i took  or  pairs i can still wear  i cant even button them up i knew something different happened they shrunk so terribly that i felt it only right to ask them to reimburse me for the jeansthe owner mr pfennig gets on the phone when i called and saidwhateverexcuse me while i scream i work in a department that saves customers from leaving because of financial issues service issues and reps who are rude to customers that have been with us for less than the  years i was a customer at this cleaners if i said whatever to a customer more than likely it would get escalated customer would disconnect service or with the new guidelinesfired i would beit gets betteri walk over to the cleaners to speak to them and show them the work they did and was further insulted by me pfennig when he said well my wife doesnt remember you and you brought these in on the th of januaryits the new year maybe your body changed if i was  i would have beat his ass over that like who goes from s to s in  days i even showed him the same size jeans that were done correctly and he still would not visually acknowledge that the cleaners shrunk my clothes i told him that  pics a hashtag and twitter would fix this its a new day and age and for someone who supports small business to be treated and talked to this way is no longer acceptablethe sad part of this was i would have continued being a customer if he had reimbursed me  for  pair of s that i purchased on sale from macys i see the one thing that stands out in these reviews is the owners lack of customer service skills i will never give them another penny and the money i spend going elsewhere will be worth itbadcleaners|horrible customer service owner takes no responsibility for ruining clothing he will blame everyone else before apologizing i may not be the highest paying customer but i deserved at the very least an apology|our bartender didnt know what a pint was or how to pour a beer|the worst customer service ever when i told my stylist which design i wanted she proceeded to say that the stat wouldnt look right on a shorter nail she then offered to do a freestyle  design on my nails which was horrible i did not like it at all i told her then that i change my mind that did not want to design and she got a attitude when i asked for my money back for the design she couldnt talk to other customers about the predicament comparing our situation to one at the restaurant i will never ever come back to this establishment because not only do they do poor work they are rude and disrespectful|stay awayweve been  times over the past few years each time we say lets try it again followed by wish wed done something elsereminds me of the movie line run away run very far awaylast nite after steelersjets was last straw i hope the owner or general manager reads this and think the health department should tooservice is mediocre and slow consistently waitress was ok in attitudeafter our soup starter good french onion soup we waited and waited and waited and waited for our mains noticing us staring at her waitress stopped by went into kitchen came back and said we were next my watch said  then her manager came by and argued with me and said we were next then at pm the horrible food finally arrived thats  minutes to be next in that time we watched  tables turn from being seated to drinks to mains to check down while we waited for our main manager embarrassed himself said they were busy and working our food and he had checked and would come soon i told him about the  tables turning and he said no they didnt then i said i used to manage restaurants and know what customer service and ticket times are and he challenged me and said no i didnt and i had no idea what i was talking about what an idiot first rule of restaurant business is the customer is always rightthen the food arrived how hard is it to do chicken marsala with mushrooms seriously it was two soggy fried chicken tenders from the deep fryer not pan sauteed over a bowl of bowtie pasta with shrooms and a sauce while the sauce did have some marsala in it it was full of sour cream and tasted like stroganoff and a little funny the penne ala vodka was sauteed canned tomatoes and no flavor we were so hungry we ate most and left hour later i was sick on the side of the road from the dinner and still feel really rough this morning|ugh i hate this place  people from work drag me here to lunch more often than i would like  the food is overpriced  the service is snotty and slow  i can barely get free in under an hourandahalf  the food is forgettable and the menu sparse  theyre terrible for pickup too  even when you call way ahead youre made to wait and theyre surly about taking care of you when you arrive for your food  you can do better for lunch on the northshore pretty much anywhere  try soho or finnegans instead|here before bucs victory over the cards in game  of the nlds a sunday game at  got here at  packed both inside and out cant comment on any other time but this really hectic one ordered pepsi and brisket nachos awful soggy chips some shredded beef drenched in sweet generic bbq sauce a blanket of cold congealed cheese spotted with jalapeo slices not a degree above room temp will give them  star for tasty pepsi and keeping it filled|ok i dont want to judge all atrias by this one in fact i wouldnt even judge this atrias solely by this one experience but let me tell you i was highly disappointedi will point out the good parts of the night first we arrived to see a band play the entertainment was great didnt cost extra although there was a  minimum per person and i liked the set up in the room where they played also the soup i got crab bisque was deliciousok now for the rest of the experience first of all our service was awful i dont know our servers name and i know some of the wait wasnt his fault as there was a large party upstairs but it took at least ten minutes to even order our drinks another  before we even got them ten more minutes before we could order our food and after the meal we must have waited at least  if not  minutes for our check before one of the members in our party finally had to go up to our waiter and complain i saw him checking on other tables and it didnt seem like he had many tables to keep him so busy as a server myself i always give my servers the benefit of the doubt but it really got to be too much the one thing i will say for him though was that he was very nice but for how much we waited we should have had something comped or at least got some sort of apology before we had to complainthe rest of the food and drinks were okay good but not enough to make up for the service i had the berry mojito to drink and the greek salad to eatid try another atrias before id go back to this one but now im weary of the restaurant all together|i came here on the fourth of july after getting off of work my friend and i stopped for one drink before the fireworks lets just say i will never return i stood there for a good  minutes with maybe  people tops at the bar the bartenders never once acknowledged me yet they did manage to make eye contact they then all walked out from behind the bar and went outside it took another ten minutes until finally the manager came over and served me i am a bartender and i am appalled to see such people being employed at what seems like a decent place i am a phenomenal tipper being that i am in the industry and sadly i didnt leave a single dollar hopefully they can learn from their mistakes instead of probably losing more potential customers  what a shame|after eating lunch several days a week at atrias pnc park restaurant for many years i have finally decided that the price has just lost any relation to portionsquality and will not be dining there anytime in the near futuregradually over the past year the prices have continued to increase to the point of being dinner menu prices for lunch size meals  recently the portion size has significantly diminished to the point of being almost comical todaythe fish special today was bbq salmon with asparagus  it consisted of about oz of salmon and four spears of asparagus  it actually looked ridiculous on the plate  the specials used to have  oz of fish included a decent portion of vegetables and rice all for a dollar or two less  while a bit more than i wanted to spend for lunch at least the quality and size of portion made some sense  today i spent  plus tax and tip and left feeling like i had eaten an appetizer and still hungrythey have pushed it too far i am no longer willing to waste my money at atrias  too bad we used to really enjoy lunch there|i was meeting up with  other people there but i was a few minutes late  because i wasnt there at the time  they refused to seat the others  not even to just get drinks or an appetizer ordered  so they left to go to some place that would serve them dominics  this place clearly couldnt be bothered to have our business  which seems like an odd way to run an organization  one star because we didnt get anything that we wanted|when you walk into a buzzing restaurant youd expect to be greeted by someone be that a server a greeter or the bartender i went in last night stood around for almost  minutes and was completely ignored i was meeting a few friends so i decided to walk across the street and grab a beer and make a reservation using open table for  minutes later  reservation confirmed and beer finished i walk back over walk in to the place and someones at the computer in the entryway on the phone he finishes we make eye contact he nods and walks away my friends come in we wait  minutes for someone who works there to talk to us i tell her we have reservations she acts like it cant happen and that its my mistake she says that the place is closed for a private party i ask why there isnt a sign on the door saying closed for private party and i get a ridiculous answer that the ceo doesnt like us to do that how dumb is that you leave your system open to make reservations and you dont alert people that might be going to a show on the north shore that the place is closed the fake sincerity is what really got me you know what a private party sign does it advertises that you are available for private parties and would have given me an hour to figure out other arrangements|i was here on a business dinner and it firmly seated itself as the absolute worst place ive ever eaten at hair in the foodcrab cakes were touted as amazing in reality disgusting ice cream scoops of poor crab and mayonnaise risotto uncooked and congealed to plate vegetables gummy and soaked in oil not properly prepped and served with woody stems i was shocked this place turns a profit|before a pirates game we stopped in to get a bite i ordered a hamburger with fries for  very disappointed it took over  minutes to get the order the meat was very dry and falling apart but not over cooked this tells me that they added filler usually bread to stretch the meat and pump profits ive had juicier meat and larger patty at wendys for a sixth of the price overalli would not go back to atrias|just went to this restaurant to try and have dinner and the guy that sat us was very nice but after waiting  minutes with no sign of a server my husband finally asked if they could send someone to wait on us and they said they would waited another  minutes and no one showed up so we got up and left awful place to bad i was looking forward we only wish we would have ordered food and then left|we had to go through these people to pay rent for our craphole apartment one day we got a notice that the house was going up for sheriffs auction we immediately talked to the people here and they told us not to worry the same thing has happened before and the owner took care of it so we think nothing of it we were college kids and it was our first apartmenta few months later we come home to find a  days notice on our front door we were never informed by the landlord or the this real estate company that the house was under control of the city even though we were at the real estate office several times to pay rent and to check on the status of things we had between paying rent that entire time that it was actually sold in the sheriffs auction that is   month from august to marchof course no matter how much we screamed and complained we never got one cent back nor did the downstairs neighbor they probably knew we wouldnt have the money for a lawyer gotta love these companies that prey on peoplejust ask around pittsburgh most people know of this company and the first thing out of their mouths are please tell me youre not renting from those slumlords|this is not a review about the food or service at atrias which i have always found more than satisfactory but rather about their handling of our reservation  i had wanted to dine at atrias for their oktoberfest menu and with saturday night being the last of october i made reservations for a friend and i at the pnc park location  just to be sure i called the restaurant and asked if the location was featuring the oktoberfest menu  the girl who answered assured me that they were when we checked in i again asked if they were doing the oktoberfest menu and again was assured they were although they did not give me the special menu which was sitting next to the regular menu at the hosts podiumi didnt see any of the oktoberfest specials listed on the menu so i asked our server a pleasant young man named qwan about it  he told me that the o specials were listed in a box on the lower left hand corner of the menu  when i questioned the skimpy selection given there he told me that they were not featuring the entire oktoberfest menu on weekends at that location but only a selection of appetizers and small plates  he told me that all other locations were featuring the whole menu   he seemed surprised and disinclined to believe me when i told him that that was not satisfactory especially in light of the fact i had called to check and had been told that the special menu was being offered and that we would be leaving i got on open table and secured a reservation for dinner at their wexford location a halfhours drive out of town i didnt speak to anyone from the restaurants management because we had to leave to make our reservation time at the wexford locationit is certainly any restaurants right to serve whatever menu or part of a menu they wish but they should also inform people when they call if they are not honoring the complete published special menu advertised  the food and service at the wexford location were acceptable other than a spinach salad that arrived only after i had asked about it and without the warm sweet and sour dressing advertised on the menu  they had also run out of the apple strudel that was on the menu but thats always a chance you take on a popular menu item|i had the worst experience with those people last yeari had bed bugs in the apartment  james streetwe were complainingand the guy called bruce didnt even listen when i left the apartmenti cleaned everything but he did not give me all the deposit backsaying that he payed somebody to clean itbulshit and he charged me  for taking off some portraits off the wall that i left therebut he did not do that cause i still can see the portraits  from east ohio street layerthe worst unprofessional real estat company|those of you with small children may want to reconsider taking them to the pittsburgh childrens museum  we went for the first time today and a staff member was running and jumped over my  month old as if she were at a track meet and my toddler was a hurdle my daughter could have easily been kicked in the head i doubt well be returning anytime soon|dont risk it never open when you need it unreliable availability with his products he offered to reserve some for me until it was done cooking and then when i returned on time he had already sold it i was excited to try it for the first time but wont waste my effort in the future if this is how customer service is handled there are other bbq places that actually have food to serve| star for your cover

goal but damn your cover d that let fitz run wild on yallnational fixed league on them spread busters  vegas owns the nfl  sheiiit|its cathartic to give this sorry organization  starnote this is a review of the baseball club not the stadium in which they play|ugh  another losing season  wtf man werent we in first place at the allstar break  what happened  i wasnt expecting a world series champ or even a pennant winner  but was a winning season too much to ask for  this marks the th anniversary since the pirates last winning season  thats right folksits been since   lets take a look at the world of baseball  the pirates roster that year included stan belinda doug drabek zane smith denny neagle jay bell orlando merced andy van slyke and of course barry bonds  all have since retired  the only new ballparks were new comiskey park now us cellular field and camden yards  no stadiums had corporate names  the arizona diamondbacks the colorado rockies the miami marlins and the tampa bay devil rays didnt exist  the washington nationals were the montreal expos  the milwaukee brewers were in the al  both the nl and the al only had two divisions each  the minor league washington wild things didnt exist either and nor did their league  kbl was the big cable sports channeltv  saturday night lives cast included dana carvey ellen cleghorne chris farley tim meadows mike myers kevin nealon phil hartman  chris rock adam sandler rob schneider and david spade  seinfeld hadnt become a huge hit yet and no one knew kramers first name  monday nights on nbc included murphy brown evening shade and  northern exposuremovies  the top movies included lethal weapon  basic instinct hone alone  the bodyguard and aladdin  when you wanted to watch movies at home you had to rent them from the video store and you watched them on vhs tapes or laserdiscs  music  bruce springsteen released lucky town and human touch  on the same day  rem had automatic for the people  gin blossoms released their first album new miserable experience which stayed on the charts for almost two years  bare naked ladies gordon featured the cult classic if i had a million dollars  you either listened to albums

alivetechnology  few people had internet access  you also used pay phones because you didnt have a cell phone  you watched movies on a vcr  you met up with your friends without texting them  you ordered merchandise by sending in or by calling an  number  you had to buy tickets by waiting in line  and oj simpson was still a football heroso thats it pittsburgh pirates  i feel like telling you im done with you guys  im no fair weather fan but  years of losing is enough|i think its a shame that the pittsburgh pirates company does nothing with african american children ever  i  go to games and have tried to get them involved in some of the programs the pirates have and they are never choosen every game all i see is non african american kids they love the pirates too pnc park need to do better by us|i was raised catholic but no longer practice and have always been fascinated by relics and the stories of saintsso i was really looking forward to our tour of st anthonys beware i cant speak for their other guides but the gentleman a lay person not a priest who led ours was far more interested in haranguing the crowd on the nature of true believers the infallibility of the catholic faith and whether wed all found our charisms  the gifts we needed to be using if we were going to be saints toothan showing us any relics after an hour of his sermonand nary a single fact about the hundreds of relics that surrounded uswe left what a disappointment what a huckster|so this is what happenedi went their complaining about a possible over heating and requesting a change of oil this was my first visit there they topped off my coolant for free and changed my oil i had a check engine light on for which i knew the code and was holding off on repairing it they charged me  for reading the check engine light code and turning it off i didnt want that i pointed this out on the bill and he said that its fine i can just pay for the oil change  he asked me if i had  cash on me if i did i could have paid and left a happy customer but i didnt so i gave him my card and he went in the back and swiped it for the full price     tax when i was signing the transaction receipt i told him that he swiped for the full price this apparently pissed him off a lot he very rudely handed  from his pocket and asked me to get out of there  and walked out i tried to talk to him and explain my reason of asking  it not being the matter of  but of the principle that he said he wasnt going to charge me for what i didnt want but he wouldnt listen was very rude and said youre done and get out more times i left i aint going back where they treat customers like that|nicks used to be good with the previous owner that all changed which is pretty sad|i remember going here when i was a little kid to celebrate my grandparents th wedding anniversary  i thought this place was fancy of so many years ago and i remember going out back to play in the nearby park and i also thought that was really cool  when i moved to pittsburgh i moved to brighton heights where millers is located but i only went once a few years ago and it was just ok  i decided to give it another shot the other night and i really regret it  i ordered the fried fish sandwich and even though it was crisp on the outside to the point of being somewhat burnt yet the inside was cold and the fish just had a weird texture like maybe it was freezer burnt or really old  the place is dingy and poorly lite it looks dirty and the overall experience was just downright unpleasant  no just no  that is all|ordered a lg pizza for pick up  min wait went to pick up my pizza and i arrived to have no pizza at all they told a driver must have taken by accident the skinny is it took an hour for a new pizza and they offered me nothing|terrible i lived about  blocks away  and with no other options  i still cant bring myself to order from here ordered twice in the last  days and both times it was terrible ended up waiting over an hour each time first time i got home to find a totally different order the send time waited over  hrs for a pizza both were crappy at best staff was really rude both times|i really loved the food and some of the employees but wow did that manager make a mistake speaking to me the way he did over a  hour delivered pizza  i live  blocks with unmelted cheese and wings with no sauce  heat up your pizza and ill bring some sauce down in an hour  not the response a customer ever wants to hear its a shame all it would have take n was a new pizza and wings  a week plus gone from them|i cant believe i requested a snail mail menu so my building could decide on a new caterer for our lunches and dinners and received  our tenant council is still looking for a new caterer since another disastrous thanksgiving dinner w another caterer i cant believe no menu requested even gave you my phone  address and  month  thank you for  and i will tell council not to use you since we didnt get menu w prices or foods this job would of been for every holidays that we have lunches or dinners|very disappointed delivery was late our gyros were cold and fries were soggy i wont be ordering from here again|this was probably the worst gyro i have ever had  even the frozen ones sold in supermarkets are better than this  extremely dry tasteless and obviously not fresh as i watched the woman cut from the very top of the thin spindly piece of meat left and then microwave it before serving me  i will never go back to this place nor will i recommend it   stay away gross and distasteful|stopped in for an oil change and they told me they couldnt open the hood went up the road to jifffy lube and they had no problem opening the hood and gave me a discount sorry pennzoil i think you lost a customer|had a friend who went here really bad experience|i had an appointment there showed up and the hair dresser didnt even show up the owner is the one who took my appointment somehow it got lost they are a hot mess i will never go here again|i came in tonight ready to buy a bike  in fact i called to see if they had the specific bike i was looking for  there were plenty of workers there and i waited around for ten minutes before i left  i was really disappointed  it was only when i was leaving when a guy asked me if i needed help  maybe it was because i am a woman  the only people getting help in there tonight were two other guys  what a terrible experience  im glad i took my money elsewhere|coffee and atmosphere are great but my god the cupcakes are the worst ever  there is a bakery right beside them they should really consider selling the bakerys sweets or none at all  i think a fakedisplay cupcake would have been fresher and maybe even taste better  yes it was that bad  mr manager try your stuff before you sell it|i bought a latteno wait actually i bought coffee and espresso and two lattes and something to munch on not all for me i had a friend with me when i ordered the nd latte i sat down and realized i didnt have any foam so went back to the counter to ask for some and and she wanted to charge me really maybe it sound petty to you but i like my lattes fixed a certain way and foam is the best part its all about customer service and considering i had just spent over  a little foam wasnt much to ask good coffee bad customer service|this was my second visit and alas my last our first visit was at lunch and it was just ok we werent blown away nor were we impressed but i will always opt to support a local mom  pop shop if all things are equal this last visit was the pitsit was pm on a saturday night we were one of two tables this is usually an indication of something fishy excuse the pun appetizer was edamame it was overcooked and left uneaten i am not the adventurous sushi orderer i had california rolls and spicy tuna the tuna rolls were mostly spicy sauce then fish very mayonnaisey and unsatisfying as for my ca rolls the avocado was all brown not just the parts on the top because i checked all the way through when i brought it to the staffs attention her response was oh yea avocado is like banana they get brown very easily and we cut that yesterday what they did bring me another batch that was part brown part green but it was too late this was my first sushi restaurant ever that we left half the rolls on the plate uneaten since we were all still hungry my daughter picked up the table tent listing all the desserts yuck filthy not wiped down in a long while or perhaps ever when i set it back is when i noticed the wall also needed a good wipe down needless to say we skipped dessert our first visit deserved a  but this visit was a |horrible food its hard to get a good chinese restaurant around pittsburgh i wouldnt recommend to my dog|such a shame   hire and run enough staff on a saturday night to take care of your customers    servers at pm with  tables may be good for labor  but after  decades of making toms diner in dormont a stop whenever im nearby  this is the last time i will be here    minutes to be acknowledged   more to get the drinks there were  of us  minutes for the soup  followed closely by our sandwiches and i watch the other customers facesall confused as i am as to whats going wrong in herewho is running the place  does anyone who owns the place actually care|havent eaten here in  years  will be another  till i go back  worst diner breakfast food ever  how can you make an omelet and potatoes taste bad  ask the cook here he has it down pat  coffee was good service was good nothing else was even down to the fruit flies flying up my nose|this once was a great place once the mighty have fallen sad the gyros there use to be amazing smh|vasta went down hill since the s they need to attract a different kind of crowd they need to change things up a lot  if you want any ideas hit me up i could give your business many ideas how to flip your business around hit me up tiffanyshousekeepingyahoocom|read my first review loved this place today i stopped in to look aroundmy niece was with me and i remembered that they had help wanted postings somewhere she inquired and the teenage girl behind the counter was so rude full on glaring and rolling of the eyes no joke i wish that the manager had been in but hopefully she keeps track and knows what her counter staff is like when she is gone i will go to party cake shop from here onthere are too many great places to put up with attitude|pastries are nice but i bought a cake for my sisters bridal shower and they put the wording on the cake incorrectly it was a saturday and could not call a baker in to fix it so they could refund me the cake and just take this one go somewhere else to buy a new cake or try to fix the writing ourselves and just remove the word that was incorrect i spent hours on the phone with the manager and she was not very helpful or empathetic to the situation  i then went to go pick up another cake for my sister for her husbands birthday and the cake toppled over in the box in their own fridge  i asked the lady if this happens often and she goes nope your just special  being really rude about it  they patched the cake up and then showed me the cake and there was a wooden stake in the cake to keep it together  i then said that there is a hole in the cake now and the counter lady said just smooth the hole over with your finger a little bit the counter girls are always rude  i honestly think they dont like me because they are nice to everyone else but myself but if i would suggest i would not go here|we were having a gender naming party for our first baby and we were excited to share this moment with friends and family when we went to pick up our cake we were extremely disappointed in the way the staff handled our order the mother to be on picking up the cake found out the gender of the baby without her husband this was supposed to be a surprise at the party but it was on the receipt how terrible they knew when we placed the order that this was supposed to be a secret when confronted with their error they were dismissive condescending and there was no effort to compensate her for her pain in finding out the gender at the bakery we have done wedding cakes here and many special events over the years never again potomac bakery you should be ashamed|like frozen cake how about horrible customer service if so potomac is the horrible place for your next eventlong time customer and disappointed to say will not buy from them again bought a specialty cake for pickup over the weekend for my yr old sons birthday went to cut the cake for the birthday party and it was frozen in the middle i called to let them know and they told me they would have a manager call me on monday and there was nothing they could do for me that day since they didnt have any other cakes unfrozen not the end of the world i thought and we would just have to eat the cake the next day then about  minutes later received a phone call back from potomac telling me i had to return the uneaten portions of the cake and get a partial refund i was floored they messed up here not having my cake ready yet i had to return the cake for a partial refund for what wasnt eaten absolutely horrible way to treat a customer when they were the ones in error i explained that i disagreed with this policy and they should be making an effort to correct the situation of sending me a cake that wasnt ready they explained that this was their policy and were not willing to work with me i expected a call monday from management apologizing for their staff handling the situation incorrectly but never was called apparently they feel that frozen cakes are acceptable for events sad part is that i have always loved their cakes and pastries but based on their views towards their customers will not be going backthanks for the disappointment to me and my son|this place is the worst motel i have ever stayed do not stay here|this was the worst hotel that i ever stayed in my hubby and i  took the smoking room and it stunk sooo bad that i wanted to throw up i was afraid to sleep in that nasty bed in the morning at am i wanted to leave the room cuz smell was sooo gross that woke me up i felt so dirty that i took two showers at other hotel i never thought that i will have nightmares bcz of bad and stinky hotel|ive never been to pittsburgh before and i planned on doing some heavy partying and needed a place to crash that was not on the floor so i booked this hotel the day before i drove up i saw the reviews  ignored them because i figured id be drunk and happy enough to dive into a bedi checked in around am the girl who checked me in barely said anything to me besides initial here and sign here and your room is over there the room smelt like hot dogs the ac wasnt working at all so i was dripping in sweat all night none of the lamps worked at all there were holes in the pillow cases and bedding there was a tiny blood stain on the sheet i went down for the continental breakfast at am it ends at am and they already stopped serving the shower was ice cold i then checked for bed bugs after realizing the shithole i spent the night in last night coast is clear i checked out and went back to baltimore which seems like heaven on earth compared to shittsburgh|bed bugs horrible place do not stay here stayed here for a wedding we attended woke up in the middle of the night with bites all over my legs arms and back we flip a pillow over and there it was bed bugs we had to cut our trip short the man at the front desk apologized and gave us the managers name and number and told us to call back later that morning we have been calling since  and have yet to receive a call back such disrespect we risk bringing back bed bugs and spending hundreds on extermination fees and no has the decency to call back|what a dump i booked this room for one night for a place to stay after a pirates game its dirty and weird our room is big but its fills with furniture salvaged for garage sales the free breakfast is as bad as it gets old cereal and bread the bed was hard and here is the best part a rhythmic thumb thumb thumb woke me up at  the whole room shook ill called the front desk and they said it was somebody running in the exercise room this when on for exactly  minute impressive cardiovascular staminawhat elsethe pool is in a green house everything is dirty there is a weird quartet sitting in the lobby at  am just talking|ive stayed at days inn hotels before so this was my first rather unpleasant experience with them i arrived late at night  when i checked into my room the hot air was blasting i lowered the temp but it took about  minutes for the heatingcooling unit to make the temp adjustment in the meantime i returned to my car to retrieve the rest of my luggage when i returned the room was cooler and now i was able to smell the most powerfully moldy smell ive ever experienced in a hotel ever i was completely exhausted from the long drive and just passed out in the morning i woke up with a horribly scratchy sore throat and swollen lymph nodes plus the nonsmoking room had obviously had smokers and pets there previously i moved to another room the following morning which was much better but the overall feel of the hotel was rather low class  skanky|we stayed here while on business i wish we had booked somewhere else the staff here is incredibly rude lazy and completely incapable of caring about customer service|never go here the fire extinguisher glass is broken and does not appear to be clean up someone could cut themselves two outlets in my room did not work the breakfast is just cereal if you want toast dont bother the toaster is broken|the rooms are filthy with mold there is so much mold congealed near the ac units and around the perimeter of the rooms we got  rooms and all had the same issues the front desk hostess was nice and helpful the cleaning staff i presume doesnt exist stay here for an inexpensive night close to downtown but dont stay here for more than that especially if youre not concerned with monies|from reading other reviews and dining guides it looks like this is very much a hit or miss place either you love pizza with toppings thrown on after cooking or you dont i fall into the later category i didnt like it at alli ordered a slice of cheese pizza and a grilled chicken salad for the pizza the crust was salvageable after i pushed aside a good quantity of cheese most of it the salad wasnothing short of horrific overloaded with fries and big surprise more cheese getting to the lettuce and other toppings took some digging eventually i found bland tomatoes and shredded iceberg lettuce hidden far belowi dont get this place|this was just bad pizza  for the money i expect that the toppings will be cooked on the pizza  the cheese and pepparoni were added after the crust came out  also the mushrooms were out of a can  do not waste money here|this pizza was the worst food i have ever eaten|no way a ton of cold shredded cheese thrown on top of pizza no no no no beer either|i knew the original owner of betos and she would be furious for what is being done to it now  if the pizza slice gets any smaller youll have to call it a breadstick  there was almost no meat on my italian hoagie which used to be the best around  whoever recently took over should be ashamed  betos now stinks|worse than store freezer pizza what with the cold cheese on top of hot pizza terrible if you want quality fioris is a few miles away|ok so the gimmick is cold cheese and toppings on freshly cooked dough and sauce it doesnt worki get the same effect from a microwave pizza that wasnt in long enough also if you are going to serve your food this way unfinished at least have the decency to use quality ingredients im quite certain the pepperoni was of the hormel variety i dont understand why you would spend your money on a low quality unfinished pizza when there are so many better options in the areahowever based on the amount of business they were doing you may want to give it a try i for one will not be returning|we are from out of town and heard this place had good pizza i decided to call and order a pizza so asked about what kind of sizes type of crust and if they do white pizza the guy told me he only had pizza crust and red sauce and since i was asking for a different type of pizza that this wasnt the right pizza place for me he told me i wouldnt want to order from them and hung up the phone not sure if it was because if my hispanic accent or what but he was extremely rude and didnt even give me a chance to order or ask i would have been perfectly fine with a red sauce regular pizza crust with cheese and pepperoni but he wouldnt even take my order i was just trying to ask rude very|if i could rate it zero stars i would their pizza is nothing more than a glorified lunchablethat was my sons description and it was spot on i cant understand how this place stays in business i have eaten pizza in italy so i know good pizza and this is not even pizza its a thick cracker like dough with canned sauce tastes like that and cold cheese covering everything just awful|i disliked the cold cheese and cold pepperoni on so so crust obviously many people like it  i went out of my way to go there and had heard of the cold cheese gimmick not my cup of teajust a heads up if you go there to compare to other pizzerias  not comparable to the other top ten pizza joints in pittsburgh|gotta say this place is hugely overrated  girls working there were just plain rude and in need of a serious attitude adjustment you work at a pizza restaurant youre gonna be busy on a saturday night get over it or find another job i did it myself when i worked at a pizza shop years ago the pizza itself is ok at best  theres absolutely no organization in the dining area pretty much a free for all for a table even if they had  person to clean tables and seat people would make it much better to eat in and to me it seems like there were more than enough people to accomplish that during the busiest hours a few  minor changes would have me coming back and im guessing many others or they just dont care because theyre gonna b busy either way|very disappointed with this dry cleaner had a small hole in a set of pants by a belt buckle came back with hand stitches that were messy and very noticeable definitely not worth the expensive prices|ive never ever experienced such poor customer service before at any beer distributor  yes i called them and asked for a price on ordering a case of import beer  when they called me back with the price i decilned purchase  i was talking at the same time to another distributor who was doing a lot more leg work for me tracking down the supply chain  when he informed me he could have a case shipped to wherever i bought my beer i gave him banksville beers name thinking i was giving them some extra business  i dont normally get my beer from there  when i stopped into banksville to pick it up a person who i assume was the owner got immediately defensive with me raised his voice saying you told me you didnt want it  i tried to explain what had happened but he continuously interupted me with a constantly rising voice level barely allowing me to get a word in  he claimed he did not speak to the guy i had spoken to which was obviously a lie since he referred specifically to that person you meaning me talked to  i finally had to cut him off and say listen do you have the case here or not  he said they did not so i lefti can understand his frustration if what i did caused him any loss or inconveneince but he did not need to take the majorly unprofessional approach that he did  i honestly had no idea that i did anything wrong and on the contrary thought i had actually done them a favor  had he explained the circumstance it would have been no harm no foul and lesson learned  and i just would have asked them to order me a case straight out and would have returned for more cases to be orderd in the future  but because of that reaction i will never step foot in there again under any circumstance  no beer is worth dealing with a world class ahole like that|awful one of the worst bars i have ever been in the smell of this place will make you gag never cleaned floor is sticky yuck stay away|small dark not very opening or friendly place will not be returning the floor is dirty the bathrooms are small tgey stink and the lock is broken on the womans side no food offered maybe u have to ask i got a vodka cran and it was watered down the only good thing was free parking out back|mediocre and poorly made you can get better quality food from mcdonalds dont waste your time or money|i would give this eat n park location zero stars if i could i arrived at am and was seated quickly but that was about it my waitress did not come over until  i did not receive water or any service for  minutes  that is outrageous to me ive never had anything good to say about this location and will not be visiting again|my experience here was not good my family and i were seated all the way in the back of the resturant near an exit after passing at least six tables upfront we were the only african americans in the restaurants not even one as a busboy we had some stares but no one was rude just very quiet  the waitress tried to make us feel welcome so we thank her for that but the feeling was uneasy and on top of all that the food wasnt good it lacked lots of flavor i wouldnt recommend this spot to anyone keep driving|dont waste your time incorrect orders are the norm its fairly disgusting sticky tables trash everywhere the last time we stopped in there were seven people workingbut maybe actually three doing work the other four were checking their cellphones or standing around talking there is one young girl there who works her ass off but the rest contribute to the chaos|this store will not let you photograph their lighting fixtures we browsed for a while and found a chandelier we liked and my husband took a picture of it on his cell phone the salesclerk told us that was not allowed we were dumbfounded we are renovating a house and need a number of light fixtures plumbing fixtures etc the only way we can keep track of them all and check if they actually might look good together is to photograph everything were seriously considering we tried to explain this and the clerk said nope not allowed we asked why she said i dont know they just dont allow it well i bet i know they dont want you going online in search of better pricing but hey newsflash thats how things work in  im not going to drop  on a chandelier without looking it up online for the record i understand that local businesses arent usually going to have the lowest price available i dont mind paying a bit of a premium to support a small business in pittsburgh that gave me great inperson service but like hell am i going to spend that kind of money without making sure im not getting completely ripped offwe tried to press further though what about matching finishes or colors to other fixtures the salesclerk said oh people just tell us what colors they have in their room and how big the room is and we tell them what works im sorry but unless youre omniscient this is not acceptable the most insulting thing though is the clerk telling us i dont know about a policy thats so clearly the exception to the local norm if youre going to have a ridiculous anachronistic rule at least have the guts to explain why to customers when they ask|the owners were all smiles when i plunked down  for merchandise and services but when i pointed out minor defects in the merchandise and major problems in rewiring an antique lamp they couldnt be bothered i have never been treated with such disrespect i dont know how they manage to stay in business beware|if i could give this place less than one star i would i recently bought a lamp here which yes is very pretty but the customer service is by far the worst i have ever experienced i should have known not to buy a lamp here as the one saleswoman was extremely pushy and followed me all around the store the entire time and kept trying to sell me a  lamp as soon as i got home i was unwrapping the lamp shade and noticed that it was cracked i called immediately and explained that i had received a flawed product they assured me they would order a new shade and it would come in within  days and they would call to let me know when it came in needless to say its been two weeks now and no one has called me about it i have now called  times and every person ive spoken to tries to shuttle me off the phone immediately without explanation the last conversation i had was with a woman who worked there who told me she was just a worker and couldnt help me with what i wanted i bought a lamp from there for a few hundred dollars they sent me home with a broken lamp they told me they would call and they still havent and now they act like they have no idea who i am and the employee tells me she cant help me i would never give these people my money again you can find equally nice things at a different store for a better price with people that actually respect you|the stuff that this store has are definitely nice the majority of them  however when you buy a lamb that will cost at least a couple of hundreds you expect to get also an equally impressive service this is by far not true in this store  the service is rather incompetent  not only they try to oversell to you but they also do not respect their customers  actually while we walked into the store i was surprised to hear one of the ladies working there asking another customer to pay upfront before doing the required changes to the lamb they had asked for as if the customer would leave without getting the lamb he went there for  i thought this was weird but i ignored it maybe i should have gotten the single and left the store  in my case while we bought a lamp the lady asked us whether we wanted one of their superduper light bulbs that will last forever  we said no it is fine since we literally have about  light bulbs at home  to our surprise when we went home we found that there was a light bulb in the box they gave us which was also apparently charged   on top of that when we tried to use this super light bulb it was not a surprise that it was not functioning at all  definitely i will not be going back to this place|some of the food and drink items are overpriced  after waiting forever to get served my food turned out to be horrible and was sent backthis entire visit was a disappointment  no reason to ever go back|this place is another that is undeserving of your hard earned money the following is an email that i sent to the owner it will shed a little light as to why i feel this wayi will also share his response and what ultimately became of the situation i know this one is long winded but you should be forewarned about giving them your moneyi have been to your bar many times and i have had both good and less than average experiences but this past saturday was terrible my girlfriend and i came to have some dinner around  pm we knew it would be crowded due to the penguin game and that wasnt a problem when we arrived there were no seats at the bar or tables available anywhere we decided to have a beer and wait after the game was over some tables opened up so we sat in an empty booth in the back and waited after about  minutes a waitress came over cleaned our table and made notice of the fact that we still had drinks sadly this was the last time that she ever came to our table we placed our closed menus at the end of the tablenothing we put our empty glasses at the end of the table with the menusnothing we sat and waited for more than  minutes all the while we were waiting another group of four sat the table next to us they were never given any attention they got up and left after being completely ignored i understand that the restaurant was busy and that service and wait times may be impacted but the way we were treated or lack of being treated was appalling it was especially annoying to watch the server that initially cleaned our table giggling and carrying on with two other booths that appeared to be friends with her on the other side of the dining room and then when she was done she just casually walked over to another empty table picked up something off of it and went into the kitchen without even taking a look around the dining room at this point we were disgusted and got up and left i was annoyed and made mention of how awful the service in the back was to the doorman the waitresses in the back were terrible and seemed to have no sense of urgency or seem to care about most of the customers with the exception of the few tables that they were more interested in socializing with this seems to be a problem because on some of my past less than stellar experiences the disappointment was again with the service from the back servers on those occasions it was the same thing they seemed to be more interested in being social butterflies than providing any sort of service you dont need to improve your wait staff you need to replace some of them at least the people working the back dining room on this past saturday they were completely useless will i come back to your restaurant im not sure the food is good but i work hard for my money and i expect to receive more than good food in exchange for it sincerely matt khere is the response that i gotplease give me a call  to discuss the matter im sorry  will make every attempt to make sure this doesnt happen againthank you for making me aware of the situationjoey demarco i promptly called him as soon as i got this email it went to voice mail  so i left a message that was it the guy didnt even have the decency to return my phone call it is amazing that this is how business owners expect to keep people coming through their doors and handing over their hard earned money support local businesses but make sure they are deserving of your money|horrible all around came in on a sunday morning for breakfast around  walked in and the girl said it would be a ten minute wait we sat at the bar to wait so she forgot about us after about  minutes or so we asked how long and she took us to the booth that was open for about  minutes went to the table sat there for about another  minutes with our menus folded at the end of the table after we had a table sit down next to is and get service right away we asked why nobody has come over the waitress was confused and didnt know why waitress didnt write down our order and had to come back and ask what we got food was ehhhfinally left around  so it took almost  hours to have a horrible experience|i ordered a burger and sweet potato fries my burger was pink on the insidenot how i like to eat them  our waitress was initially very helpful and took it back to the kitchen to have them cook it longer for me minutes later my date had finished his meal and my fries were gone  our waitress never returned to let me know what was going on when she did i ended up asking her to just box my burger up for me to go thinking i would eat it for lunch the next day  when i reheated the supposedly recooked burger the following day it was still pink on the inside  so i am not sure what the kitchen had been doing for  minutes but it was not cooking my burgerwe will not be returning here|from the moment we walked in i knew we were in for in for an interesting experience instead of being greeted with a smiling friendly hi welcome to cains we were greeted with a frantically working unhelpful stressed out hostess who had no clue how to deal with the influx of people we were there during a breakfast rush when we walked in the hostess told us that it would be  minutes for the kitchen to prepare our food since we had known cains for their delicious breakfast we thought the wait would be worth it but an hour and fifteen minutes later we get our food my breakfast burrito tasted like nothing and a our food was cold the only good thing about the experience was the warm donuts poor service crappy food overall not the way a restaurant should be run|i would give this place half a star if i could the service was the most appalling i have ever experienced we ordered sandwiches and fries and waited a full hour for our food after  minutes of waiting we had to glad down our waitress to find out how much longer she laughed it off and said there were three tickets in front of us still our veggie burgers and fries came out cold but by that point we wear starved and not about to send our precious food back to that black hole of a kitchen where apparently time doesnt exist the waitress gave us our check stated that the manager would not do anything for us for the long wait and she did what she could and discounted  from our  bill ha we requested to speak with the manager who avoided us for  minutes before she came over and made excuses about it being busy and other people ordering specialty items she continued to make excuses and said the best she would do is discount  what a joke i would never go back here if someone paid me|do not order steak or prime rib here  the prime rib ordered rare was medium dry and extremely salty  the rib eye was thinly cut salty and dry  when i told the waitress she said the chef said it should not have been and maybe i did something to it like it was my fault  i felt insulted  the bill was  so it is pricey  i was very disappointed and would not order anything but wings here|hi therewent with a group of five for brunch today and things started off well coffeewatergood fun then we orderedthree of our party received their orders within  minutes and liked their food the fourth got his about  minutes later and his food was terrible cold greasy stale the fifth me never received the short stack of pancakes and eggs i ordered bad service by the wait staff and managerthey checked in with me and left to figure out where my order went several times then theyd come back and ask whats wrong as if they forgot they were already tasked to find my order cains is usually a good place but this morning they dropped the balland apparently my pancakes and eggs|came for breakfast kim the manager was mean from the time we walked in the door we tried to sit at a table but she told us they had a big party coming then she sat  small parties there  minutes later after those people had gotten food and eaten we asked about our breakfast we were then told it would be another  minutes funny thing is my friend had told me how horrible the service is and how mean the chick at the front acts we tried to give them the benefit of the doubt bad idea this place is a bad idea all aroundone star that belongs to the bald bartender|very disappointed in this place the food was pretty good ill give them thatbut the owner was inappropriate to say the least he wouldnt leave my female friend alone and got extremely inappropriate with her to the point we were forced to leave bc she was uncomfortable with his neverending inappropriateness we are never going back|i really cant believe this place is still open due to the service and the food i came here with  other people and all of us felt disrespected ignored and abused at one point i had to call the manager and he flat out told me to shut up at one point im an adult not a child and wtf is he thinking that he told me to shut up hes lucky i didnt flip the table then and there believe me if you ever want to be treated like an adult and have a nice meal avoid this place like the plague this place is a cancerous sore in dormont and with cancer you get rid of it this place should be torn down and turned into something nice that supports people and doesnt leave a sour taste when you leave this place is sad|i really wish i could give this shit hole a zero but i have to give something first we get in at  pm and after where seated we wait a good  mins for our waiter to show up to take our beer orders another  mins later and still no beer another  mins we finally get the beer and of course everyones beer is flat another god damn  mins later still no beer or waitress to take our food order finally after about an hour we get set with our beers and food our damn food is ice cold at this point im fed up along with everyone else and we call over the manager this little dick head comes over and starts yelling at the four of us saying we either have a choice to eat or get out we were more than happy to get the hell out of there with the shitest service and cold ass food ever the long and short of it is that if you want to have a even good or a sorta good experience at diner without being told by a manager that i should stop talking do not ever go to this place never ever go to this place if you even want to have a meal or a hot meal if i should say because this place will bend you over grab the broom by the handle and sweep your ass out the door with it ive never had someone esp a manager tell me to eat or get out thats all i have to say|we have been there twice in the last month and both times the orders were brought out wrong and this past time there were items missing and instead of taking responsibility for messing up the order the waitress blamed it on the kitchen when the missing items were brought out they were cold and inedible|ordered salmon fishy smell not fresh at all had to talk myself into eating it hostess not friendly she asked me what i wanted made me feel like maybe i should walk out should of went with it overall dissapointing meal good placement of tvs is about it|great beer list and service is awesome no more monday all you can eat crab legsnot cooland how do you not have ribs or chicken when its two of your main thingssupposed to be known for your bbq and you dont have italright coming back to add to thisthis place is empty and for a reason my family and i got  dinners  salad a burger which was way over done and dry and  bbq dishes the brisket and pork only two meats they had and everything was cold not hot at all server kim was awesome so apologetic and we know it wasnt her fault manager was awesome and wasnt her fault either and they did comp our whole checkbut kitchen has a lot of problems i hope they work through them bc it is a nice place|they got the date of my wedding day wrong after we discussed the day and date for months i called to see where my flowers were after they were suppose to arrive and they told me they got the date of my wedding wrong and thought it was the next day my bouquet didnt have bloomed flowers my flower girls bouquet fell apart as soon as we put it on her wrist and the flowers arrived  hours late not to mention the stress that was put on me the bride on my wedding date with the fear of not have flowers|i came home one night to find unpackaged flowers sitting at my door normally i would be excited however this was not the case my information card was poking out of the flowers in the open revealing my full name address and phone number being a young woman living in a new city i was upset to see the carelessness by dormont regarding my privacy they did not care at all that they left my personal information out in the open for anyone passing to take when i called to complain the woman apologized and said that this has never been brought up as a concern before even though it has never been a concern before it should immediately become one for you when a customer is calling to complain especially when i said it made me feel unsafe this is the last time i will ever want to see dormont florist anywhere near me i am the type to always enjoy fresh flowers in her home and will be finding a new florist with higher standards|for what its worth dorstop isnt good as people say it was people are fanatical about this place and its food is their food really tasty or theyre popular because the network show from my perspective i detest their service the service is notoriously horrible and unacceptable also the food was unpalatable i order pumpkin flavor pancakes and side order scramble eggs i was too full and their portion is huge so i left two pieces of pancakes the waitress dont even bother to ask me if i need a box to take it home or if everything is good although she did refilled my coffee once i barely see her stop by and there wasnt too many people in the diner is isnt likely she is occupied by that amount of customersi think the waitress was rude because she never say thank you during the entire breakfast even when i tipped her i should have known i just feel like they treated me differently thats all this review is based on my dinning experience and the service seriously if they mean business they should improve especially waitress was lack of enthusiasm do i want to come back never ever|i really really wanted to try dor  stop but it wasnt open when i went my wife and i woke up early just to go there and the diner was closed for the next few days even though it didnt say that on the website such a waste of time if youre going to go make sure you call ahead just so you dont get screwed over like we did|pancakes pancakes pancakes  everybody told me i had to try and their pancakeswell the short stack they served me were lousy pancakes|dorstop is my favorite breakfast spot but on this visit i was extremely disappointed  i stopped in on a whim alone and sat at the counter  while i was eating my delicious breakfast a dishwasher stood in front of me and spit  in the garbage can on the other side of the counter literally a foot away from me  i immediately wanted to throw up  i did not finish my meal and got up and paid and left  they were too busy too mention something and they never asked how everything was or i would have said something  i am not sure if i will go back which is really a shame  i love that place|aside from the quaint brown paper on cardboard packaging i just cant get into bland sauce on cardboard equivalent crust ive had better factory pizza at  for a large around the block|im wondering what was worse the service or the product  if you are going to have a bad attitude there should at least be a good product waiting for the customer on the other end  if you offer a subpar product at least be nice  these guys offer the worst of both worlds  dont bother|new ownership is a joke  has manager fire a  year employee over the phone  no balls to handle the situation himself or in person nice way to operate a business  idiot|quality has taken a nosedive since changing hands  nothing is as good as it was  now its just crap|you know its bad when you get in your car practically in tears because of how bad the haircut is having curly hair ive had my fair share of terrible haircuts the one i had at this salon was among the worst i explained to the owner of the salon how i wanted my layering but apparently because i didnt tell him exactly how to cut my hair  since after all i figured hes the one who should know how to cut hair including curly hair  its my fault that i received such a terrible haircut sorry i guess i was too busy watching in horror as he blunt cut horizontal layers into my hair exactly the opposite of what youre supposed to do with curly hair the owner clearly has no idea how to cut curly hair and hes overpriced to boot the other stylists may give better cuts but the owners attitude its not my fault suggests this salon deserves no ones business|short of getting on my hands and knees and begging the stylist to cut one half of an inch i dont know what else i could have done before every haircut i explain that i am very particular about the length of my hair  i want to keep it long it grows very slowly that it is imperative to only cut a tiny amount off etc etc i made this extremely clear to the stylist she promised that she wouldnt do anything crazylets just say i am using this as a cathartic outlet for my experience because i went in for a trim but left with four inches missing from my hair im still recovering aesthetically and emotionally from this trauma it just doesnt make sense to me why a stylist would do exactly the opposite of what was requested i think maybe she is used to cutting childrens hair and not listening to them but either way what should have been a really quickeasy trim turned into one of the most extreme haircuts of my life it all could have been so easily avoided it doesnt feel fair proceed with caution|my daughter has been going to geno como for about a year now her stylist was danielle emmons she called to make an appointment for herself and me  mothers day gift  unfortunately she was told danielle no longer works there gave us appointments with owner geno for saturday  pm and pm we arrived at pm my daughter was first she showed geno the length she wanted he cut it shorter than she wanted and you couldnt tell that it was chopped up all different length since he dried it blowing curls in he asked her if she liked it she told him she didnt like how he styled it and that she would fix it when you got home my turn i should have went with gut feeling run but i didn cause this was part of my mothers day gift i told geno i donate my hair to locks of love and showed him how much to cut off ive been donating my hair for years and i know how much to cut geno told me i should donate my hair to pantene and preceded to tell me why he likes them better than locks of love told geno thanks for your input but i donate to locks of love he put my hair in a ponytail got out his electric trimmer and preceded to cut off my hair all the salons that have cut off my hair used scissors weird   he cut way more than i showed him the back is so short the front is longer and the hole cut is choppy all different lengths i dont know what to do with this other than wear a hat for a few week thank god my hair grows fast this man clearly should retire i wish my daughter would have read the reviews before we went there and she would have seen geno cant cut curly hair we got there at pm and geno took my daughter right away we werent finish till pm that   hours to destroy two heads of hair one reviewer said he takes his time i dont think that the case he looked a little confused at time over priced  each for geno when my daughter had danielle she paid  but they dont tell you geno prices not nice   save your money dont go there and if you do you will be wearing a hat just like me|my mistake that i went to namaste india with my cousin pappad were served in the beginning and that was the only moment we could afford a smile rest was a complete disasterwe ordered aloo tikki and much recommended samosa chaat  samosa chaat was cold to touch looked like a heap of poorly cooked samosa worse was the red chilli powder used as garnishing  we asked it to be a bit spicy our fault that too in plenty we could have used that amount of red chiili powder for cooking food for some  people taste was below averagewe could barely think of ordering main course after the initial encounter malai kofta is what we ordered besides daal malai kofta looked like stuffed with samosa  pun intended  bland and tasteless naan were good thin  baked properlyout only consolation no wonder we left half of the  ordered dishesworth mentioning is the fact thatkohlis store is adjacent and we saw some samosas therei wonder if the ones we had at namaste were part of the same deal please beware of this place you may end up cursing yourself for your visit later on as we are doing right now|this was probably one of the worst places ive eaten at in a while  im not sure what was worse food or service  never again  the coupon we bought and werent allowed to use left on the table|i have dined at namaste for the final time  i am tired of being served by an individual that does not speak who treats the customer with disdain and indifference  the words thank you and how are you are not part of the lexicon here  the buffet items reflect economizing  virtually no cauliflower is used thus my favorite dish aloo gobi is never offered  there sometimes is no rice pudding and in place of the india staple buffet item chicken tandoori the cheaper and less appealing chicken wings are offered  it is s shame that such a beautiufl comfortable restaurant space is being wasted  for a mere  more i can receive a spectacular and delicious array of the finest indian food in the lovely atmosphere of all india north craig street oakland where i receive gracious personal attention from the owners|i wish i could give this place  stars for its terrible food quality oily greasy and bad taste all  members of our party fell sick throwing up andor with a running stomach|shockingly bad  i know its pittsburg so my expectations were low but there is no call for rudeness  the old lady should retire  the young waiter was ok but clearly  scared of the woman   i went to the dinner buffet at  pm the food was obviously left over from lunch the rice was so old it was crunchy all other food was very low quality and mostly cold i always like to say something nice so the sweet carrot dish was not horrible  my search for quality indian food in the burgh continues|i wish i could give them  starstotal waste of money food was so bad that i threw it in the trash hope no one falls sick after eating food here|maharaja is located in the days inn on banksville rd and we tried it one day for lunch not really understanding the positive reviews here but to each hisher own i found the food watery overcooked even by indian food standards and tasteless there seemed to be no care in preparation of the dishes so that the vegetables werent cut into the same sizes each dish tasted much like the other and the food didnt even look attractive i dont mind divey surroundings but i abhor a smelly old carpet and they have wall to wall carpeting that was around before most of us were they offer mango lassi which they keep in the original gallon plastic jug that they bought it inat least pretend that you made it there are  better indian restaurants a stones throw from this placenamaste and mintt both across the street|terrible place to eat and not very clean at all way over priced foe fast food  for a plain roast beef forget that|wellim sitting here and the lady running the front is screaming at everyone in the back it is stressful to listen to not an enjoyable experience she needs to calm down|i actually dont mind the arbys chain i certainly dont go to one on a regular basis but when i do i usually enjoy the treat that is a sonotgoodforme fast food type of sandwich and a side of curly fries usually what i get from an arbys is an aok fast food variety sandwich that while greasy is still very tasty and doesnt leave me feeling sick to my stomachthat said i never truly enjoy the food i pick up from this particular arbys firstly often when ive placed an order in their drivethru ive found that ive had to sit and wait for my fast food for  to  minutes after waiting for my food  on the days that i didnt leave the line in frustration before placing an order at all because i couldnt even do so in a reasonable amount of time  ive found that what ive gotten has been mediocre compared to what ive experienced at other arbys common issues ive come across include the lack of sauces when ive asked for them overcooked food and so much grease that the sandwich begins coming apart and after eating i begin to feel sick to my stomach sorry guys i may not expect a lot from a fast food joint but this arbys just doesnt impress me|sadly really went downhill they switched to a new vendor the prices went up and they are no longer having sales|consumer beware this place is a joke we had a party of thirty and had heard good things about this establishment  the food is average at best same pizza as cicis pizza as far as taste we payed a little shy of  for two and a half large pizzas a small pan of overcooked wings  two loaves of bread with some balogna and ham they called a hoagie and a small salad thank goodness they had beer and wineat an extra cost for us to drink and two televisions to watch the football game onbut wouldnt turn any sound on   they told us it was an all you can eat buffet for our guest most were over  but when the wings and salad were gone they would replinish it only for an extra phenominal fee  the people who wanted to enjoy a cup of coffee were also told so sorry that will also be an additional costthe money isnt an issue if they would have been up front and honest with us we all had a terrible experience here and unfortunately will never step foot in this place againand to top things off  the pizza and two so called hoagies that were left overbecause they were all bread and we payed for we were told we could not take home because someone might get sick im sorry but i didnt pay to feed your staff dinner  on a good note the bartender was a great guy and very good at his job|one of the worst steak sandwiches ive ever eaten there were  of us and the only people who liked their food were the kids and the one who had the pizza i would never eat here again|i am not being hyperbolic when i say that my last experience here was the worst food experience i have ever had i have eaten at bados before and have had pizza that was pretty tasty so when my roomate wanted to go there i was pretty excited there were  of us two of us had burgers while the other two ordered wedding soup and shared potato skins my burger was delicious it was juicy and smothered in bleu cheese while my food was really good there were some issues with the other items ordered two of my guests cited that the wedding soup had a metalic taste to it while my other friend with the burger found a hair being a hairdresser and understanding that it does happen sometimes she disregarded it and continued to eat her burger unfortunately the hair did not stop there another guest found several hairs in their meal as well we decided that we should let our waitress know i stopped the waitress and explained how there was hair in two peoples food the waitress got upset and was very rude its not like we accused her of planting the hair herself on top of this she mistakenly took my burger and walked away with it leaving the sullied food on the table when she came back i told her that my burger was not one of the items with food on it and she instantly became defensive at this point we asked for a manager who never came and insisted our meal get comped considering she threw out the only good food that we ordered we didnt feel like that was asking too much luckily the waitress did not put up too much of a fight i will never eat at bados again a good cheese burger and a decent pie isnt enough when the staff cant even accept their own human mistakes i have been places where there have been food issues before and i have also worked in a restaurant i completely understand that mistakes happen however the reaction that we received was unacceptable|i will never go back besides the gnocchi coming from a vacuum sealed bag they offer a  pittsburgh sandwich  they dont know how to make served fries on the side and bagged coleslaw fries were an afterthought due to the pickle found underneath  watched a young waiter spill two drinks or e on a customer  same waiter after avoiding a table with cash payment waiting for them to leave so he could pocket the change finally got them change as soon as they left he pulled out his wallet and put the tip insideso unprofessional food from a box and under trained staff not if they begged would i go back|very disappointed in our delivery order this evening the potato soup was runny and looked like milky water with a few potatoes in it the wedding soup was less than fair thee buffalo chicken sandwich had no lettuce or tomato on it the reuben and fries were soggy and greasy the chicken salad the lettuce was wilted although the chicken strips were the best thing in the whole order the turkey grilled sandwich also had no lettuce or tomato and was greasy and soggy and did not come with the chips and pickles as listed on the menu for what they charged for this it was a disgrace  we will not order again and will pass the word around there are too many other  decent and less expensive delivery restaurants to ever order from there again disappointed|had the gnocchi delivered absolutely terrible gnoccis had to have been  years old delivery guy was shady too|i dont like this place at all the staff here is always rude and has no sense of care at all for their business a couple years ago i had heard they smoke over making their pizza all of their employees tend to be shady i dont recommend at all|absolutely horrible i used to eat here  years ago when i was in high school and i thought i liked it from the moment the jerk answered the phone until the gross food was delivered by the rudest delivery driver ive ever come across it was a horrible experience|i used to live in the area and would always patronize and recommend this business  however with the last experience i will have to rethink that my aunt and uncle ordered a gift basket for my grandmother for her birthday when it was delivered it looked beautiful  however once opened not so much  inside it was filled withdollar general brand goods when i stopped down to tell them the owner and another worker told me what do you expect if it was a busy season we would have gotten stuff from the strip so moral of the tale if you want to pay a whole lot of money for stuff from the dollar store you know where to go to make it even more special the owner will provide a blank stare and a warm welcoming attitude that clearly shows she does not care|i wish there were negative stars i could put for this place  one of the most unprofessional experiences i have ever had with a business owner not even a worker  i was yelled at mocked and generally treated like crap for checking up on a remounting job that was supposed to be done within a week  emotional mess the rest of the day  i have never been treated that way with any owner of a business   i work with restaurant owners for gods sake   unbelievable   if you want the full story email me and i will tell you the whole thing  as it is right now do not patronize this business   there was absolutely no excuse for his attitude|so incredibly disappointed with the service i received at blooming dahlia last month i actually felt sick to my stomach after leaving the store because the florist who i believe was the owner was so nasty basically kicking me out waving goodbye with one hand as if quaking like a duck and rudely blurting out bye bye in a mean tone and in front of my  year old daughter who was actually shocked by the florists behavior are you kidding me i had preordered a presentation bouquet a few days prior for my  year old who was performing the lead role in the nutcracker that sunday one dozen esperanza roses at  each i went to blooming dahlia because i wanted something extra special for the bouquet that would be presented to her onstage during the bows  though the bouquet was not ready when my older daughter and i stopped by the store in between saturday performances i did not complain when i noticed the florist wrapping the roses in light brown tissue paper that actually looked like a brown paper bag i asked if they had any pink or white tissue paper that they could use instead the florist was visibly annoyed by my request but did look to see if she had any other colors which they did not okay i thought i can simply rewrap the roses with pretty tissue paper when i get home but when she started ringing up my order at  per rose versus her original quote of  each i decided not to purchase the bouquet why would i pay such a high price for roses that were nice but certainly not extra special and that i would have to go home unwrap and rewrap in my own tissue paper i actually apologized to her and said thank you but i have decided not to purchase the bouquet which by the way was still not completely arranged and wrapped she looked at me and asked so you are not taking the bouquet and i replied no im sorry its not what i was looking for but thank you and thats when she rudely waved me and my daughter out of the shop needless to say i will not be returning to the blooming dahlia and i will not hesitate to share my unfortunate experience with others there are plenty of other good florists in the south hills|absolutely wretched and incompetent billing department  overcharged four months in a row called every month and was repeatedly told it would be fixed  i went to american express to file a dispute and at least they were able to reverse the four overcharges  even after that i was randomly charged for a system upgrade that never happened  i am considering filing a complaint with the better business bureau and the attorney general|if i could leave adt security a negative review i would  this is the worst company as far as billing  customer service are concerned  i work for a general contractor on the west coast and we use adt for our clients  security patrol is standard but the problem is that their invoices are obscure to the point of insensible referencing  other invoices that were never received  the only way that you can view the invoices is to login to their website with a password no one has from a letter that is only mailed out the jobsite  i am not at the jobsite where construction is done i am in the business office where we pay bills  their csrs put you on hold for  minutes at a time only to tell you lies about what they can do then you have to call back and deal with them all over again when the lies are uncovered  they are the worst company do yourself a favor and stay away from them|awful customer service they tell you one price and its completely not enough security to cover a small house then they charge you a ton to actually secure your house only telling you after it was installed holes in your wall for keypad and drilling in your ceiling for smoke detector when you try to cancel it takes forever and they are rude my advice  dont use adt save your money and give it to an honest company not this awful one|awful service took us  and a half hours to get our food and the waiter forgot several items then added a few beers we didnt order on to our tab im assuming because he thought we were too drunk to notice then we find out that after we had nicely split the tab for them even adding in an extra  on top of the grat because we were too lazy to redo the math that they wouldnt split the check in the time we argued about it you could have run the  credit cards we had and been done with ithad to argue with the manager who was completely unhelpful with one of the waiters standing behind her and being rude to me for backup for  minutes and they didnt give us an inch i would have stiffed the waiter for the awful service if i could have but we got gratted so i didnt even have that optionif you want to come here with more than  people avoid ds their beer is severely overpriced  for a beer i can get at sharp edge for  no thanks and the food is the same fried garbage covered in cheese you can get at any other bar in pittsburghin other words dont come here i used to like this place but tonight was such a bad experience ill just go to one of the other places in pittsburgh that serves hot dogs french fries and beer there are plenty of them i wont miss ds at all|overhyped food rude service dont care about their customers  what happens when the owner values money over being there to oversee the business  im a local and have been going to ds since they openedbut that doesnt matter any morewith the exception of eli the bartenders are generally rude  food is subparseems the busier they are  the worse the food is  what a shame  it used to be my go to place in the square where i would take outof towners or go after a mountain bike ride in frick  despite the numbers of great beers i cant justify giving my money to a place that doesnt care about their customers|while awaiting the arrival of your wedding dress you should feel excitement and joy not desparation and hopelessness  the delivery date was pushed back many times until it finally came in over  months after they said it would and gave me the runaround throughout the entire process  i didnt think my dress was coming at all to be perfectly honest  i had unreturned phone calls and was lied to by donetta the owner  janie was the consultant i worked with the most and she was always pleasant and helpful however the store overall struggles and i would never go back  if you are shopping for a wedding dress run far far away from this place  seriously take my word for it  i ordered my dress well in advance and no one should go through what i went through wondering when you were going to get a straight answer and if your dress was ever going to come  i have read many negative reviews for this place and still gave them the benefit of the doubt shame on me  check out the better business bureau bbb  brides by candalina is rated an f  they have unresolved isssues with customers and unfortunately they really dont care shopping for a wedding dress should be one of the most exciting times of your life not a nightmare  there are many other bridal shopsavoid this one|i went to pick up my wifes bridesmaid dress she was the maid of honor on a very boring wednesday afternoon around  from the outside the place looks like a bomb shelter with dresses in the windowthe show room is upstairs but you would never know it from the drab basementlike entrance as i walked up the stairs i notices zero customers in the store however two employees were working on the sales floor i stood there like a jerk for a bit while both employees one was the owner kept to themselves the owner did not respond to me for at least  minutes even though the store was empty and another employee was just walking around dusting the store smalls like the inside of a mascot costumewhen the owner finally saw me she made a little annoying noise like what the hell are you doing here she walked over slowly like a zombie looking for fresh brains and giving a crap why i was there she asked me to follow her as she took me downstairs to an absolutely empty storeroom by that i mean what was she doing that was was so important that she couldnt wait on a customer and took her sweetass time to get the dress which by the way was a second alteration you see they screwed up the first time they altered the dress even after my wife tried it on there and markings or whatever were made so everyone is entitled to a mistake even a business that claims perfection its important to give them a chance to redeem themselves but to my surprise she handed me a bill for the second alteration are you kidding mei argued a bit but then gave in what was i supposed to do we were leaving to go  miles away the next day for the wedding so i paid do not go here ladiesoh if you think im exaggerating feel free to google this company and read the many reviews that make mine look like a compliment if you have ever needed a dress for a wedding or your wedding these reviews will scare you|awful customer serviceattendant woke up on the wrong side of the bed she was sooooo rude here is my story my friend and i walked in and started going upstairs as the sign indicates you should a voice from downstairs says im down here so we turn around and start going down she then starts up the stairs and says no go upstairs she asked what i was there for and i told her i was in for a appointment to look at wedding dresses and then she said no what kind of dress a little taken i calmly told her the style i liked she took me into the room of dresses and said to look around she did not offer to pull for me she knows her stock not me i found one dress i had a mild interest in trying on she asked if i needed help trying it on at this point in no mood to deal with her i said my friend would help me we took the dress in the fitting room and noticed it was dirty and tattered we tried it on as best we could if anyone has tried wedding dresses on you know how difficult that can be as fast as we got it on is as fast as we took it off and booked it to the door no way i was placing the responsibility of ordering and altering a dress for my wedding day in this shops hands they cant even give you the courtesy of trying on their dressesall i can figure is this lady has zero patience and should not be working with the public sheesh|i ordered a bridesmaid dress here when my best friend got married and i had a good experience so i had high hopes that my  bridesmaids would also have a good experiencethe pros the dresses are beautiful and the prices are good overall i loved my bridesmaid dressesbut getting to that point was one disaster after another  i had my bridesmaids pick from two different styles of dresses two bridesmaids and my maid of honor lived out of town and we were told they could order over the phone so after that was all taken care of we waited and waited and waited we ordered on february st i was told that because of chinese new year the dresses come from china it would take about  weeks for them to come in at the end of may i called just to check in about my order the girl who answered sounded confused and told me shed have someone call me back no one ever called so i called again after a week and was told there was no way to track my order and that id have to continue waitingthen in june my maid of honor calls me she got a bridesmaid dress in the mail yay but it was not the dress she ordered not even close in fact it had some other girls name on it and a different wedding date it was a dress from someone elses wedding i had to travel back to the store to return that particular dressfast forward to july  weeks before the wedding the dresses finally arrive they are the right sizes the colors are pretty i am relieved until my one bridesmaid from out of town calls me to tell me they ordered her the wrong style dress shes an easygoing gal and normally this wouldnt be a concern but she had just given birth and was nursing and the dress they sent her was strapless and a little skimpy i called to see how candalina could possibly amend this and was told by the owners wife that she shouldnt have ordered over the phone and that it must have been her fault for ordering the wrong dress i asked to talk to the owner but was told he was out of town so now im pretty livid i travel there again to see if i could talk to someone in person the woman who was there was very understanding but couldnt really help me she said there was no time to order another dress no time to get additional fabric she suggested buying a shrug in a close colorin the end that bridesmaid got a partial refund for the dress but that was after much time and effort and after many conversations this experience was not worth the beautiful dresses save yourself the headache and stay away from this establishment planning a wedding is stressful enough you dont need to deal with this mess of a business on top of it|worst dry cleaners ever  not only do they do an incredibly poor job on the clothes but the staff are particularly nasty and rude  the kids who work there are fine but the older ladies are just plain miserable  i would rather spend more money someplace else than go back to this hell hole|last friday i dropped off my best interview suit at regency cleaners and verified that i needed it back by monday because of an interview on wednesday they assured me i could pick it up on monday morning monday afternoon i stopped by and was told the suit wouldnt be there until pm when i insisted that i had been told morning she went into the back and came out with what i first thought was the suit but turned out to be only the jacket she told me to come back after pm when i asked to speak with the manager she informed me that she was the only person there i asked her to have the manager call me  she said the manager wouldnt answer the phone and reiterated the pm time when the last delivery came and petulantly informed me that none of this was her faultat pm i called and was told that the last delivery hadnt come yet and id have to call later i again asked them to have the manager call me and she told me she couldnt give me the managers phone number  which i hadnt asked for i was again told this wasnt her fault as of pm the delivery finally arrived but not my pantsi was told the manager would call me after she arrived in the morning i finally called at am and was criticized by the manager for demanding her home phone number and told that there was never any guarantee about when clothes would be returned even when a rush was placed on them apparently a lot of clothes were missing from the monday delivery so i wasnt the only person upset about this situationwhen i told them theyd lost my business for good i was told that was fine and hung up on forcing me to call again to find out exactly when i might be able to expect my missing pantsat this point im still waiting and will be for the next three hours in the meantime i have to go out and try to find a suit that i can afford as a replacement just in case i absolutely cannot recommend regency cleaners they leave high school kids with no customer service experience or training in charge of the store with no manager available for unexpected situations and there is no guarantee about when or if your clothes will ever come backthis was my first and last time dealing with them|i have been in this bar many times with a friend of mine who has been a patron for decades and i thought the owners were really nice people but now i wonder  my friend is now confined to a wheelchair and still likes to frequent this bar however there are a couple of steps that lead into the back rooms where there are pool tables dart boards etc  she cannot get to this area and has a ramp that she would give to the owners so she can access this area  they refuse to put in the ramp  i thought all public businesses had to comply with the americans with disabilities act as long as it does not create an undue hardship  tell me how is putting down a ramp that is given to you for free a hardship  shame on you cathy|let me start off by saying i hate the dentist  it is my worst fear  i came to edgewood dental after stellar reviews and let me tell you my first impression was amazing  they were professional so nice easily scheduled me in and numbed me so much that i didnt feel a thing  although i had  cavities filled my teeth are horrible i felt good that they did a good job  flash forward  months later i received a bill in the mail because my insurance downgraded and no longer covered white fillings  first i was very upset that i was never told of this downgrade  i was given an estimate and paid on time in full  not sure when this changed or why i was never told by the office or insurance company  regardless i called over  times to discuss a payment plan with the office  when i first emailed them i was told i could choose the amount with which i wanted to pay to cover the amount owed  then i was told my amount was too low and would get a call back  never heard from them again  i was very upset  i emailed and called so many times  meanwhile i have always paid everything on time and as an upstanding person would never not pay a bill  i have been sending them checks and they are cashing them and just not even saying a word  jerks|i live in regent square and have been to dunnings about a halfdozen times over the past several years  it was never a great restaurant in fact it was never even an average restaurant  at best the food was mediocre and the only time that i would eat here was when i was too tired to get in my car and travel the three or so miles to the union grill in oakland which offers similar fare as dunnings  and does an incomparably better job of itrecently however things have taken a nosedive at dunnings  i now consider dunnings to be the single worst restaurant in the city that ive ever had the misfortune of entering  i recently had the worst restaurant service experience of my life at dunnings when our waitress first ignored our party then hurried us through our order then left us sit for over  minutes waiting for food with empty drinks  we then received terrible food soggy sandwiches brown lettuce in a salad and cold french fries  stone cold and when we complained about our fries the waitress launched into an angry tirade nearly yelling at us about how it wasnt her fault that she just picks up the food and that there wasnt anything she could do about it  when i asked to speak to the manager he just shook his head sadly and offered us free desserts  i told him that i didnt want to eat anything that came out of a kitchen that clearly showed that the people working in it simply didnt care  at all and we didnt want to eat anything not even the food sitting in front of us and just wanted to pay our bill and leave  he said that he was going to comp our meal  it was a disastrous experience  the single worst restaurant experience of my life  and i will never return until the restaurant is under new management  it is crystalclear that the current manager andor owner isnt doing his job and i cannot understand how anyone would choose to spend their hardearned money at this establishment when virtually every other restaurant in town offers far better service and food  in short no one  not the manager not the waitresses not the cooks  cares about the customer  not at all|ive lived around the corner from here for about  years and just stopped by for the first time a few weeks ago i regret this decisionit seems like a neighborhoodtype place where people just keep coming back because theyve been going for years mostly older clientele and families with young kids we were there around pm on a saturday it filled up pretty quickly after that i ordered the steak bruschetta medium the flavor was good but the meat was so chewy i couldnt swallow anything larger than a dimesized chunk the garlic toast that the meattomatoes were on was burntsomeone else in my party ordered the soup of the day i dont remember what it was but it looked like green mush she didnt like it and politely mentioned to the server that she didnt enjoy it the server said that they had been thinking the same thing they wouldnt want to try it either and took it away without offering an apology or a replacement i wasnt expecting a star restaurant walking into this place but i expected more than crappy service and bad food there are so many better places on that block of braddock alone go somewhere else|this place continues to be a joke  the service is bad and the attitude of the workers is worse  my order is never right and yet i still gonever again  i officially deem this place the worst restaurant in pittsburgh|worst service  dirty  slow  ignorant by the strictest definition  do not go here  bad  real bad|inattentive staff  dirty tables i agree with the other reviews here  i think the manager only hires other smokers and they spend  of their time sitting outside smoking instead of being prepared to serve customers  i go there because sometimes its convenient bc of the location but last week they left their ac broken for over a week in  degree weather  no additional fans nothingthen when it was fixed i went in ordered coffee and an order of hummuscarrotcelery prepackaged  not only was the hummus watery from sitting in that container for several days but the celery was rotting at the ends yes brown and rotting  i showed the kid working there who was probably jonesing to have his next cigarette and i asked for another one  without opening it i could see at least  of the other servings of hummus were also all watery and had celery that was starting to rot just like the one i was given  i asked for my money back  you know what was the worst thing though  the kid he knows nothing about customer service let alone food service put the containers with the watery rotting celery back in the case to serve to other unsuspecting customers  hello allegheny county health departmentthen the ultimate insult  kids came in selling candy bars  ive seen this there before but this time i said to them you know this is a business you shouldnt be here  well the older of the  girls probably  at most  where is her mother put her hands on her hips and said in a smartass tone we asked da owner we is allowed ta be herewell that coffee i spent  on  that is the last money i will spend in that place  disgusting|my guess is that ruth k was put up to writing a nice review by the staff or owner  regent square deserves a better coffee shop run by someone with good business sense  what kind of a business only prepares food chickentuna salad hummus once a week  does chicken salad hold a week in your fridge  also whenever they lose an employee they just shuffle their schedule and close at  pm for a few months  they should be open till  pm as it is with all the foot traffic in the neighborhood especially in the summer my guess is they see this place as nothing more than a loss leader for the bar they own next door   otherwise you would think that since opening in  they could at least take the time to slap a coat of fresh paint on the placebtw katerbean did go smoke free before the allegheny county ordinance went into effect but the place to this day reeks of stale smokeadded note looks like my previous review was somehow deleted  ill just say i received an order of hummus that was watery and had rotting celery in it  tried to get another and  or  of the orders in the case were all in the same condition i asked for a refund and afterwards watched the kid working there put the other containers back in the cooler to sell to other customers that was the last straw  i wont spend another dollar there|ughhhh katerbean is the abusive boyfriend that i keep coming back to and hate myself for it there is nothing else around and convenience wins today due to the snow and my extreme exhaustion and need for caffienewhy do you ask i just asked the gal behind the counter kindly if i could borrow a pen for a moment i got an annoyed sigh an eye roll  and zero eyecontact really i asked for a pen not a kidney my pleading for a coffee shop intervention from someone anyone is now a red alert help us rs residents please|is it possible to give zero stars  if so katerbean would rate a zerobad atmosphere unfriendly employees slow and reluctant service pump your own coffee dingy interior dirty tables  if they only had telescreens which couldnt be switched off then this place would be a perfect setting to film orwells |this place is now closed  best thing that couldve been done with it  going to opn in a couple of months under new management as the b caf i look forward to seeing what some new life does to this place|horrible discourteous owner and inept service people  no way would i ever recommend this place|very poor service no coordination between staff went to the store explained to the woman there what we are trying to do she gave some schpeel about how they have been in business doing this for  or so years took an appointment with their installer to come give an estimate the appointment was  weeks out between  on the day if the appointment i take a day off from work the dad calls at am asks what the job is and states they dont do that work if you need to buy appliances go to a big box they are cheaper if you need anything else stay away from these guys|wow my first one star review so you know it was bad  we found this place through our home warranty company  our dishwasher was broken when we moved into our new house the sellers were supposed to have it fixed by this company before we moved in however it was still not working on movein daywould not drain  i called perla and they had no record of being out to our place to fix the dishwasher sellers did pay for it and said they think they had the wrong zip code written down and could not find the house i mean are you kidding me  so we scheduled an appointment for a service man to come out this took several calls as they rarely answer their phone and one lady is extremely rude whenever she answers  the service man was scheduled to come in a week between pm  he shows up at  because he typed the wrong house address into his gps instead of going to the appointment scheduled before us well lucky us  he recommends we get a new dishwasher as it would be cheaper than fixing and he leaves after  minutes the home warranty company says otherwise and tell perla they will pay for the parts  perla never calls to make another appointment so again i have to call about  times until i can get someone on the phone to schedule a second appointment  we were told the parts they ordered had come in  the day they were supposed to arrive we did not get a call so i called and they said they cannot find the parts they ordered for us another are you kidding me  two weeks ago they said the parts had arrived they said they would call back if they find the parts and never do  meanwhile we are waiting at home for them to arrive  i call them back and the parts have been found and i demand they tell me when they will be coming in an hour they finally show up and fix our dishwasher  so far so good but honestly i would have rather bought a new dishwasher at lowes and been saved the headache of dealing with this company stay far away from them for your appliance repairs|i purchased a through the wall air conditioning unit three years ago from perlas appliances the customer service wasnt the greatest but the  btu units were limited in this region at the time after installation was completed the unit performed very well until july  when it no longer produced cool air the unit was removed and taken to the shop for repair and has remained at perlas ever since after leaving numerous messages with no return call i stopped at the shop on a friday  found nothing had been done it was said of rocco he needed to consult with a colleague and hed call by midweek he never called  as of yesterday i contacted the manufacturer to see what can be done i would give a zero rating but thats not permitted|purchased several appliances from perla had an issue with the washer after it was repaired incorrectly called to have it repaired again took off work and waited all day to find at  pm the work order had been canceled cslled to see what could be done and was threatened by perla to be shot now he wont fix my waher poor service|i really want this place to be awesome because yet again i want regent square to be an up and coming area  this place has been here for years and as i sit drinking my bitter bitter coffee and smelling the overwhelming scent of i believe dog pee i wonder how its even possible  the three times ive been here im greeted as if im a colonial space marine trying to fish a child out of a vent  they always sit in the corner peeking over the top of the counter as if i am terrifying to them then duck out of the way  then grudgingly come when i peek around the counter at them  if i didnt im convinced that they would just sit there as if theyre not certain of what position they hold in this place or what the next step should even be  this is what i like to call the dance of shitty customer service  today and i write this longingly looking over at square cafe i decided to give it a chance because it never is crowded and i figured the quiet would be a good thing  the girl at the counter was on the phone and thats the way it stayed for two minutes until i said excuse me  the charming reply yeah she grudgingly got off the phone and after accomplishing the herculean task of handing me a cup i pumped this swill that im currently drinkingshes currently muttering under her breath back in her corner  im not sure if maybe shes having a bad day or shes just an asshole butif i had to bet im going with assholethis place has pretty expensive coffee for how awful it is and the foodjust dont eat the food  side note this place isnt quiet at all when somebody orders something  she stomps around like shes being sent to her room  then continues mutteringokay so this place is a travesty  bad coffee bad odor bad lighting unbelievably bad grudging service  i would beg the owners to put any effort into this place  as it is now its cornered the market in regent square and sits like a middle finger boastfully pointing at the people of braddock avenue|racist classist or both great pizza wish i wasnt excluded for bullshit reasonsthey would deliver to me when i was a six minute drive away from them to my workplace in wilkinsburg which is located a couple of block from regent square yelled at me we dont deliver to wilkinsburg when ordering from my home which is also a six minute drive away but four blocks from the regent squarish area of wilkinsburg  i understand delivery cutoff points but when i asked where these were by the owner we just dont deliver there we dont deliver to your street i dont know where the cutoff is we just dont go thereended up ordering from a pizza place in squirrel hill and they deliver from a whole nine minutes away|this store is so gross that i was almost sick onions peeled and halfrotten squishy garlic dirt everywhere i will never step foot in this place again|security guard confronted me at the door at  pm like i was scum and an idiot for shopping near the end of his shiftclosing time he wanted to know what i was going to get i told him some stuff he told me i had about  minutes to get it i informed him i had about  minutes he told me i would be out of the store by  he proceeded to follow me through the store i sought out the manager who seemed to think this was great customer service i left my intended purchases and walked out without buying i havent been back since i am a professional i had taken off my tie and my sleeves were rolled up a    made an online complaint no reply|one of the worst wendys ive ever experienced  every morning there was a minute wait  after ordering  for food|didnt get all of the items i ordered and paid for whats worse is i wasnt given a receipt so i cant even prove they forgot to give me something when i called corporate to tell them of this they said i could just go back and since i had some food in hand that i should get what was missing with no receipt i dont think so she decided to give me the store number instead so i can inform the manager before driving there so they gave me the number and all it is is busy the few times you can get through its a dialup set of tones that are ear piercing we also didnt get straws or utensils for our food though there wasnt hardly any wait at all so i must have been lucky there but not lucky enough for good service|wow i hope that the one experience i had here was unique and not the norm for frequent customers all i wanted to do was to buy some thermal socks which they didnt even have any for men   i just ended up grabbing the next best thing oddly they did have thermal socks for women which i almost purchased i go stand in the check out line and i dont think ive ever dealt with slower people than those who work here and thats saying something not one but two of the registers i stood in line at froze and the women had to wait for the manager to fix  they didnt seem to mind at all which leads me to believe this happens all of the time i waited for my beau who bought something after i did another  minute wait  needless to say i will not go here again|first off i like family restaurants and avoid chains when possible sometimes thats not possible  in the future ill avoid this one no matter whatits always a zoo the servers are not interested in what they are doing and do it poorly food comes out of order or not at all the managers dont care we actually had a waitress spill the soup catch most of it in her hand and dump it back in right in front of us then she gave it to us before thinking to ask if we wanted another just go anywhere else it cant be worse|normally one would think one chain restaurant is just like the rest but i have had nothing but problems here the staff appears to be constantly changing as does the managers which should tell you something ive been there for lunch and dinner and continue to have issues here are just some of the problems that we have had a coworker had an entire glass of iced tea dropped on him and nothing was comped on his check we have had to wait a very long time for our orders to be taken i ordered the pick  and was told that the soup could not possibly come out firsteven though ive done this before they have argued with us over what the meal is supposed to come with to the point of us showing them a picture and staff does not appear to be properly trained|another overdone steak and utterly inattentive staff still sitting here waiting for someone to give a careso we finally got the attention of a server who was not our server michael she was kind enough to take my steak back to the kitchen michael our server finally shows up  minutes later with a halfhearted apology and to let me know that my steak was being prepared again he does not offer to refill our drink glasses that have now been sitting empty for  minutes the manager makes an appearance and brings me a strip steak that looks rare from the sight of it he informs me that my steak is on him and apologizes he goes away i cut into my steak and its you guessed it pittsburgh rare i asked for medium rare he returns and i tell him that the chef needs to go back to culinary school and learn how to prepare a steak the manager apologizes again and asks me if i want to take this pathetic piece of beef home with me not only is it rare but its a cheap cut of strip steak that is loaded with connective gristle i said no thanks he comped my husbands meal and we left i never hope for people to lose their jobs but the cook and the server really need some serious retraining i will never go back to this applebees again|takeout is a mess at this location in the past ive had to wait  minutes past the time they gave for pickup and sit on hold for  minutes only to find out it was because they didnt have anyone manning the phone the last time they didnt include an entree wed ordered and a month later have failed to send a gift card to make up for the cost|benihana  its just rolls off the tongue doesnt it  no unfortunately notatallanymore  from hence forth all mentions of benihana are likely to cause anxiety in my usually calm heart  i hate complaining like this i really do but sometimes you just have to ya knowtuesday evening i met a group of friends for a birthday dinner  the reservation for our party of nine was for pm  all but one of our party arrived prior to  but the hostess was curt in explaining that all party members needed to be present before we were seated as our chef would be ready to begin meal preparation as soon as we were seated  fortunately the final member of our party arrived shortly and we were seated at pm  it was not until pm that first contact with our server was made without any apology for the delay she took our drink orders  she name withheld because i dont want to be rude returned more than  minutes later with our drinks but waited another  minutes after that to take our dinner orders  as i was waiting i looked over at the table next to us who were also clearly celebrating a childs birthday  at one point the mother im assuming smiled at me and said i hope you get out before midnight weve been here over two hours  were taking our cake and getting out of hereupon taking our orders one of our guests explained that due to a shrimp allergy it was necessary to cook any shrimp ordered by our group in another area a neighboring grill etc  our server said that she would have to ask the manager who came to our table shortly thereafter  when the manager arrived at the table my guest explained her allergy and his response was that it might be in her best interest to leave  im giving him the benefit of the doubt that he meant leaving the table not the restaurant but im not certain of this following this recommendation he mentioned that she could wait in the bar as the rest of us dined tableside  i asked him why it was not an option to prepare the shrimp at a neighboring table but he expressed concern that other customers may require the use of the other available tables  i understand his point but the restaurant was nearempty as the hour quickly approached pm  finally he offered to prepare the shrimp portions of our meals in the kitchen  im not sure why this wasnt initially mentioned as an option but ill leave it at that  our chef tom eventually arrived at our table he was very pleasant and efficient during the course of our meal preparation  during his time at the table my emperors salad was delivered as were the majority of my tables sushi orders  however two of our guests that ordered sushi were not served at this time  in fact they were not served until a full  minutes after the rest of our party finished our meals  at one point they inquired about the delay to shewhosenameshallnotbementioned who responded that they were waiting for the rice  when she delivered their food there was not a single mention of the delay  two hours and thirty minutes after we arrived at benihana we left  from start to finish the entire evening was a terrible experience  it was ridiculous to the point that there was not even soap or toilet paper available in the restroom  were it not for the kindness and professionalism of tom and the awesome company of friends the night would have been a complete waste  my final thought is this the food was fine but because i was feeling particularly piggish on this tuesday evening i enjoyed two california rolls from my stash of costco sushi at home before departing for the restaurant the difference between costcos rolls and benihanasa toss up  just sayin  the good news is this will give my friends something to whine about for years to come|many great memories and great experience at benihana but last night was not horrible service took  mins to even take a drink orderthen when i had a question about a speciality wine the waiter says he didnt know so ok no big deal could he go find no told me to go the bar and ask the bartender really then the chef came out and was pretty good although cooked everything separate starting  with only onions and zucchini wheres the veggies from start to finish it was about half an hour if we ate the dinner as a whole it wouldve been cold so we ate as we went also drink refills were a tough task too the chef had to keep asking other servers to assist few and far between we had  birthdays at our table not one song  which i didnt care not one complimentary picture no dessert was offered until another customer said something then the bill oh the bill that took another  mins at this point i told my family to go ahead home and i will wait considering this overall experience was almost a  hour ordeal i was double charged on two items at this point i was done dealing with this incompetent and appethetic waiter went to settle my bill with the manager who was nice and accommodating rectified the errors and was generous with a  refund i told him about the experience and all he said was i can take picture now for you um i was by myself no thanks one last thing the male greeter needs some drug intervention he was high as a kite and made my daughter  i feel very uncomfortable to the point of invading our personal space and staring with those glazed over eyes as he staggered to and from his post wow  boo and sad  |this is by the far the worst hibachi restaurant i have eaten at the food is very bland from the onion soup to the fried rice which basically was white rice with chopped onions to the chicken which was so pale it looked like it was boiled hibachi food typically has tons of flavor and tastes good because it has some grill marks and char which none of our food had i question whether it was even cooked on the hibachi table we ate at a regular table but ordered from the hibachi menu not only was the food bad but the service was terrible our waiter didnt even know that hibachi dinners should come with the two sauces he acted confused when i asked for them additionally we ordered a sushi roll for an appetizer and instead of getting it before dinner we received it after our dinner even though we saw it sitting at the sushi bar for a good  minutes beforehand this restaurant may have been around for a long time but it doesnt even compare to other hibachi restaurants and was more expensive than any other ive eaten at|this place is crappy the only veggies u get is onions and zucchinis took the server  min to serv us drinks then took them  min to take orders by the time the chef comes out already an hour just for the food and the show after we ate our waiter didnt even recommend anny desserts just gave us the chek and leave with out saying anny thing els o i for got we were still eating like wtf im still eating and so was mi family and u just give me the check the chef just left like five min ago  i recamen go sime where els n eat|this is the worst hibachi i have ever had  we came here for a friends birthday and i will never be going back service was mediocre but the food was the real travestyyou go to hibachi for a show but its not fun when the cook makes the same giant eagle joke the entire time  he also couldnt perform all the tricks that are pretty standard from hibachi chefs  the food not good  my boyfriend ordered tofu and it was cold in the middle  he didnt bother to have the guy heat it more bc it would have just been a hassle  the chef forgot one friends meal completely and got rude with the server  then after everything was cooked he looked at me and asked did you eat all your shrimp i replied no you never served me any i had ordered the chicken and shrimp  he then sends the server back into the kitchen to get more by the time they were cooked everyone was finished eating  come on  to make matters worse when we left we saw that he was the head chef that doesnt say too much for the rest of them i dont know how people keep coming here  there is way better hibachi in pittsburgh for a lot less money  i mean honestly i paid  for a glass of kendall jackson no the best part of the meal were the cupcakes that my friend brought  do your wallet and your stomach a favor and go to a different hibachi place  benihana is not worth your time or money|never again as a life long south hills resident  benihana used to be the place to go  birthdays special occasions date nightsetc  used to  is the key statement here  this place has gone so downhill its no where near the quality it once wasa wait even with a reservation a wait for every single thing we needed or requestedover priced sake for basically a slightly larger than a shot glass size amount  an up charge for fried rice  lukewarm tea  for the record everyone is supposed to get tea with the meal and no one did i had to ask for it  a chef that responded im very tired when asked how are you this evening   the chef did zero show while cooking the food very  very slowly i repeat zero  presentation isnt that what half of the benihana dinner is supposed to be   we ate our steak and chicken with what  remained of the zucchini onions and what remained of the rice that was presented way in advance of the meat    this was by far one of the most disappointing dinners ever   i give one star because the food still tasted good but everything else was dismal   dirty stained menus dirty floor around us a lackluster cook a server who was slow and over priced cocktails we had a  pm reservation and left a little after  and not because we were having such a good time it took   hours to complete this meal  unacceptable i will never  ever go back here and i will tell everyone i know to spend their money elsewhere|where do i start  the horrible location  the hostess that had little to nothing to say prior or during our seating  or do i skip right to the waiter  for those of you who have lack of taste enjoy employees at a restaurant that seem they could not care less about their job or even enjoy sushi not made the correct way  even if you love establishments that hire employees that seem to not care for quality of food or knowledge of food  i highly suggest you go herewhen we arrived at this location which opened up  minutes prior to us getting there we noticed a few individuals already sitting at their tables enjoying themselves so we figured wed be sat right away  instead we were then informed by the hostess to please wait for a few minutes because they were getting our table ready  ready for what  we werent even asked how many individuals would be dining nor if we wanted hibachi or the sushi bar  after we found a seat by ourselves we awaited approximately for about  minutes for a waiter to give us our menus  after receiving our menus from our mute friendly waiter we were asked if we were ready to place our order  our starters consisted of spicy seafood soup edimame and shrimp tempura  after a few more minutes we decided we wanted to enjoy sushi for lunch and so we placed our order to the waiter and asked if our starters were about ready in which he replied yes they should be out shortly  instead  of our  sushi orders come out followed by edimame and then followed by the shrimp tempura  minutes after that  we then proceeded to ask about the soup and rest of our sushi order we were informed the soup takes a very long time and that the sushi was being made still  we understood why the sushi may take a little more time due to what we ordered  the edimame was very delicious but the shrimp tempura had me baffled at what we had ordered and why the cost was  for the very small portioned flavorless tempura which included im assuming a thousand island dressing for some reason  it was definitely not your normal tempura sauce in which weve enjoyed many times before in other benihana locations  as we get our nd batch of sushi our soup was still not ready  is this a lack of service food staff or poor kitchen management with untrained so called chefs  we decided it was best to simply cancel the soup in which then we were coincidentally informed the soup was ready and if we still wanted it  during this whole ordeal we had not seen our original waiter since we had placed our orders and instead had  other employees that had no clue what we ordered and had to run back and forth asking what we had and what we were waiting for still  i wouldnt have minded being informed our original waiter was busy and they were going to take over for him had our order been alright or even if had our food been tasty  the tempura was horrible the sushi was questionable and the service was beyond ridiculous  if youre wondering what was so bad about the sushi ill make it simple for you  looks and taste both scored a  out of   lack of knowledge of the sushi from the employees should of been a red flag to us from the get go instead we took a chance  we love benihanas but never again at this location  from our experience with hibachi type establishments weve always encountered great personalities great service and tasty food that left us wanting to come back for that experience  instead we left with a sour taste in our mouths and with about  less in our pockets|seems my review was filtered so ill share my  cents again this place is sad  awful service awful food and the lack of knowledge is a smack in a real chefs face|where do i start  the horrible location  the hostess

hibachi type establishments weve always encountered great personalities great service and tasty food that left us wanting to come back for that experience  instead we left with a sour taste in our mouths and with about  less in our pockets|the absolutely worst hibachi experience ive every had in my life it was my granddaughters th birthday and thought shed get a kick out of a hibachi chef fist we wait  mins or so to be seated the restaurant wasnt even half full we chose the dinner portion instead of the lunch because by this time we were very hungry and the waitress said we would get larger portions she lied our hibachi chef was absolutely horrible he spoke so softly that you couldnt hear anything he said he barely spoke and didnt put on any kind of show at all our  year old was so bored that she wanted to leave the other party that was seated with us all ordered the lunch versions and they got more food the chef mixed everything together so no one got a larger portion than anyone else the only thing that we got instead of them was a half a slice of zuccini and a little bit of onions none of us even like onions my steak was at least  fat which the chef cut off and disposed of which didnt even leave enough for a small sandwich by the time our main course was served our vegetables and rice were ice cold we asked to speak to the manager who told us that they weigh the portions in the back before they bring them out to cook them however like i said the chicken was all mixed together and at least  of my steak was complete fat and thrown out the manager didnt seem to care at all about our situation we paid almost  a meal extra for the dinner portion he could have easily knocked it down to the lunch price but he refused after all this we over heard another chef complaining that the place had new owners and everyone quit  i for one will never ever go back there and would suggest everyone who reads this to stay away we feel completely cheated|if it isnt broken please for the love of god leave it alone i have had the good fortune to eat at and experience some really fine restaurants around the country so it may suprise some that locally two chains never failed to bring me back again and again benihana was one of them sometimes i ate there  or  times a month imagine my disappointment when twice i order my go to chicken and shrimp only to find shrimp is now colossal shrimp that had the consistency of shoe leather and mushrooms apparently dont apply service consisted of being scorned by an older asian lady and told it will be a while to get my order corrected because they are busy then while i wait at the bar i ask about my favorite bartender im told oh they fired is ass truly more info than i needed especially from the new bartender with no personality that took forever i was alone empty bar to serve me my ten dollar gin and tonic looks like ill be sampling one of the many japanese steak houses not called benihana in the future w h at a shame how can someone take a restaurant that was so good and ruin it so fast it really must take some effort i just hate to see it i used to love this place|extremely disappointed food was absolutely awful  we sat at the bar and ordered from there  benihana special rice tasted like overcooked white rice with salt and chicken stock poured over it  our vegetables were so soft they all tasted the same mushy  my sushi hamachi had a  x  piece of underbelly still attached and was also inedible  our chicken was flavorless and rubbery  to top it off our server was uncaring and disinterested  this will be our last trip here as there are now much better options  its too bad a once gold standard restaurant is not any longer|went for a friends birthday and had the worst experience ever we waited a while to order food once we received drinks the waitress  wasnt very good at explaining the menu we then sat and waited at least a half hour before a chef arrived only to tell us that he was taking another table and were getting a new chefthe chicken was chewy and undercooked and  people at our table didnt receive what they ordered when it was time for checks the waitress became standoff  ish with us telling us that someone needed to pay for the food that wasnt received because she has nothing to do with the chefs we requested the manager and explained that our chicken was undercooked he actually ate the chicken off of a plate and told us it was fine  at the end of it all the waitress didnt even know her managers name and was bashing him to our party very unprofessional  i wont eat there again and will be sure to advise others to do the same|my family and i have been going to benihana for about  years now weve always had to wait at least a half an hour to be seated even when weve had reservations in the past its been forgivable mostly because its close to home for us the food is okay albeit a little pricey and my grandmother absolutely loves the entertainment of hibachi but that all changed last night when we went out with a party of  for my and my mothers birthday i made reservations two weeks in advance for our birthday dinner when i called they were almost totally booked and only had a few spots left that evening our reservations were for  we arrive a little early at  and i let the hostess know that we are there and she checks us in then we basically just wait and wait and wait we notice the hostess turning people away and we notice two tables who have been seated for about  minutes now havent even gotten their soups or salads by now its nearly  oclock then my mother overhears the hostess telling someone that they are short staffed and the wait is going to be extremely long by this point weve been waiting for  minutes my sister takes a walk through the restaurant and notices there is only  hibachi chef working but there are seven tables seated all waiting for fooddrinks so i ask the hostess how much longer before we are seated she informs me that it will be at least another half an hour before we get a table because two hibachi chefs and two kitchen chefs called off sick it would be another hour after were seated before they would even start taking our food orders this is totally unacceptable first of all the hostess should have informed us when we arrived that they were short staffed and we would have a very very long wait or the manager should have phoned people with reservations and asked if they could reschedule either way we should have been informed instead of letting us stand in the lobby for an hour not knowing that it would be another hour and a half before we would actually eat on an evening when we had reservations we decided to call ichiban to see if they could accommodate us they told us we could walk right in and be seated immediately as we were leaving we ran into a gentleman who was outside smoking who told us that his party had reservations for  and they still had not ordered their food it was now about pm our first dinner at ichiban actually turned out to be much better than our previous dinners at benihana so i dont think well ever be going back there i think ichiban will be our new hibachi restaurant of choice|we went to the mad mex in cranberry twp and wont make the mistake of going back the food was horribly hot like they just toss in heat for heats sake rather than for taste i ordered the mole chicken enchiladas and that was not any kind of mole ive ever had the sauce was more like a weak thin ranchero sauce and both the sauce and the chicken was too hot even the guacamole was too hot i recognize this restaurant chain is trying to be a trendy fusion of texmex and ca but they failed luckily they are in the same parking lot as a pharmacy so i was able to walk straight over for some tumsif you want good texmex go to el campo in monaca or el paso mexican grill in chippewa both restaurants are excellent examples of good texmex similar to the styles typically served in central california|this afternoon i took my  year old to this mad mex for lunch after a great morning swimming and doing a yoga class  we had to send back our food because the chicken was stone cold even though surrounded by sizzling veggies on a skillet  it seemed like it was yesterdays chicken  they brought out fresh food and im kicking myself for having eaten it  the rest of our day has been spent cleaning up food poisoning accidents and in the bathroom|while i love mad mex this one is to be avoided  for whatever reason they always seem to manage to mess up orders and on a couple of occassions ive just not felt well after eating there  because its a bb i just keep thinking i had to be wrong about that  but after waking up in the middle of the night with all sorts of unpleasant stomach issues ive had to write this location off  go to robinson instead or bb please please get a new km for this location|horrible service i mean horrible went during a nonpeak time pretty quiet in there not a lot going on three employees who were sitting around chatting watched me and my my disabled elderly friend stand and wait for long endless minutes without doing anything i finally went over to the bartender  also hanging out and chatting and watching us stand there  to ask if a hostess was available her response oh i can seat youreally then why did i have to ask you tothen the young male waiter assigned to our table just laughed when my companion asked where the restrooms are wtflook guys that would be crummy service to anyone but to treat an elderly person with a disability like that is just unconscionable we left and wont be back|do yourself a favor and find another pizza location i am a ten minute drive from this location order was supposed to take an hour and fifteen minutes when it was a half hour late i called and the manager said they called and were at my door ive had no calls and was on my porch all day only person who showed up was the mailmanthe manager then called me back and said he believed his driver was lying and he was  as a courtesy to me  going to rewarm my two hour late pizza in the oven and send it over to me as soon as possible|can you give a company zero stars  this place makes you feel unwelcome and dumb  the staff is judgmental and assigns you tasks solely based on their reaction to you  aka assigning us the most mundane task and then taking it away and giving it to another couple because we werent fast enoughwe went on valentines day food tasted just okand the staff leading the group was horrible  not even remotely worth the cost if you will be treated like an imbecile|dirty and small  not laid out well  expired items on the shelves  rude cashiers  self check out usually broken  horrible experience more than once  i dont shop here unless i have to|store is too small and always crowded managers and workers are rude and condescending actually just had an awful experience with a manager named chris his attitude toward me made me feel putoff it made me want to leave the store after i have witnessed him being rude and condescending to other customers too i just dont feel as though this store has hired workers with good customer service skills especially this manager chris|obviously you arent coming here because it is in any way cool or because of the s decor you got kids with you or others whose palette doesnt extend past burgers and fries these limitations can be overlooked what cant be forgiven however is the shabbiness of this place it looks like it gets vacuumed once a week and the bathrooms are disgusting|stopped for dinner there while traveling on business  greeted by a friendly hostess seated and ignored   after  minutes without a server i left  will not recommend to anyone else passing through  i dont know if all the wait staff didnt feel like serving one person because tips are smaller for one than a group or if they were just incompetent or just rude  extremely dissatisfied|went there on my first day in pittsburg wasnt the best experience my waitress was to busy talking to her coworkers that she couldnt even give us any sauces the food was ok but nothing to great when i go back to pittsburg i will not be going there again|absolutely horrible service when we entered the hostess gave an audible sigh like we were inconveniencing her with our presence  we were seated for over  minutes and never had a server come to even take drink orders  needless to say we left and we will not be going back|i wish i could give this no stars heed my warning  i should of listenedviewed yelp before goingi waited  minutes for a hostess to come and take my name on a sunday at  to eat this place was not packed why while waiting i used the ladies restroom let me tell you ive seen cleaner restrooms at a truck stop good gosh  it was disgusting there were two stalls and one of them was disgusting from what the other ladies were discussing while waiting for the i was in there was paper all over the floors  really doesnt anyone come and check this so i go back out and we get seated the area around us is gross carpet is very dirty and not swept dirty dishes on empty tables and it looked very unkept our waiter came up ill keep his name out of this but he looked like he just woke up and rolled out of bed and came to work he took our drink order and left came back and dropped them off and left again like really your menu isnt that big we got the pick three on the menu  comes with the tortilla soup burger and fries and a cookie the soup came out quick the only good thing that happened we finally got our food  i swear it took like  minutes i got my burger and it was very pink in the middle but had the waiter asked how i wanted my burger cooked he would of known that i wanted it done and not pink however there was no way i was sending it back i didnt even eat all of it i gave half of it to my husband to eat the fries are very salty never did our waiter come and ask if the food was ok how we are  nothing rude then he comes by and says your cookies will be right up  like ok we dont get a choice of which ones we want i guess not so we get the cookies  they are outstanding as always but not worth the trip this whole adventure took a hour and half others around us that didnt have our waiter seemed to have better service so i am wondering if it was who waited on us either way i am not going back to find out how disappointing because we recently moved here to pittsburgh from virginia where they took out our max and ermas  we loved it there so we couldnt wait to go back to one  how quickly we found out not all are the same|high prices horrible service  model cleaners claimed  per shirt but failed to tell me that certain materials anything but cotton will cost   my total bill was more than double my regular bill at my regular dry cleaners i only went here because i had a groupon huge mistake absolutely stay away from any model cleaners i can assure you both the service and the prices are so much better at red cap cleaners or any runners cleaners  this place is a joke|a young child is the cashier who cannot explain the services as an older woman looks from the back and observes the confusion caused by the untrained employeefirst frustrationshe does nothing to help the second is the lack of chairs in the front because you really need to sit down before asking how much the total bill will be  i as a customer felt like i was bothering them by bringing them my business more competition might change the way they conduct business employees bad attitudes combined with outrageous prices makes me wonder where the business sense is at off to sams|absolutely awful service and the highest prices of any dry cleaner in or around the pittsburgh area hidden fees upwards of  per shirt exist for any shirt that is not made of cotton this wasnt made clear until i picked the shirts up from the model cleaners on cochran road in greentreemt lebo area and received a bill upwards of  after expecting only a  chargethe older woman that worked the front counter at this location was extremely rude and short with me absolutely horrible experience from beginning to end stay away|model cleaners failed to deliver  shirts and  suits in june  i called the manager tim and after many phone calls said that his driver had a malfunction with the clothes in the truck and that my suits and shirts may have been delivered to the wrong location  he said that he would contact those who might have them  after a few phone calls later no shirts no suits  suddenly the suits and shirts appeared on my door  i called them to find out and they did not know they had been delivered  so i am assuming they were delivered by a neighbor  i then took inventory of my suits and found that  suits are missing   i called and left a message with no answer and also left an email no answer to that either    today i received a call from tim august and i just cant afford to lose any more suits  i will be doing business elsewhere|they dont always do the work they say theyve done  i took my car there for an oil change and three weeks later the check engine light came on  when i took it to the dealer they said there was very little oil in the car  i had the dealer do an oil change and checked it a month later to make sure there isnt a leak  there isnt the car is fine so im convinced ntb never did the oil changewhen i went back to ntb they kindly gave me a refund with no trouble but offered no explanation or apology  when it comes to cars i have to be able to trust the mechanic and the greentree rd  ntb has proven to be untrustworthy  i obviously will not return|made an appointment for an oil change came in the next day was told there would be a  to  hour wait even after i  told the guy behind the counter i  made an appointment they called me i gave them my number when i made the appointment  i call them back was put on hold x finally just hung up so incompetent i did not even get a chance to rate the actual service|i havent been to wendys in some time now  but wow what a disappointment the people all look like they hate their jobs and treat the customers accordingly the food was horriable the number one meal was down sized to the  cent cheeseburger and the fries tasted like they were sitting in grease that was a year old the big coke was  ice and  water and  cokei threw my mean in the garbage i wont be back if this is what michael obama wants us to eat  well lets see her and her kids eat it wow dave  i bet your turning over in your grave  you poor bastered |repeated my order  times and it still got screwed up i had a feeling something was going to be off and sure enough|consumer alert rats|i love panera and there food but this panera ranks lowest of the low poor service menu options not available dirty utensils i could go on|because i was pregnant ive waited anxiously for  months to eat a bacon turkey bravo sandwich i ordered one today and received a sub par sandwich instead of the amazing tomato bread i got plain rye instead of my favorite gouda cheese i received american the most amazing thing is that there is literally no bacon on my bacon turkey bravo sandwich wtf i really hope that this specific panera bread is to blame as i would hate to stop eating at this restaurant all together|the place looks like something from the godfather  old school  dark and gloomy wood paneling complete with crap brown pleather chairs and fake wood tables the food was cooked well but lackluster i got veal picata which mostly had the flavor of flour and beef broth on the plus the staff was very nice and very attentive management  you really need to update the place|a while back my mom bought some donuts from here and they were really stale by the next day  she called and mentioned something about it to them and they didnt even seem to care  i like to try and support local business but with an attitude like they showed i have no use for them  doesnt seem to be any real set hours so you never know when they will be open|darrens recent review of kmart got me thinking about this place i was out this way recently and i stopped to look for a place to eat man talk about a dead mall parkway center mall even has its own listing on wwwdeadmallscom id only been here once or twice back in its heyday back then it had chichis where thankfully i never ate a hepatitis scare did them in david weis pharmor compusa syms etc were all here now the mall is mainly deserted only one floor is still open and even thats got a vacancy rate of about  surprisingly what remains seems to be doing good business kmart is doing okay as is the giant eagle phantom of the attic is alive and well and so is pittsburgh sports deli thats not an eatery either its a sports memorabilia store there wasnt much reason for me for me to linger here though  i soon left and went over to olive garden for lunch|what a depressing shell of a mall i remember when it was the mall to go to compusa pharmor kmart playless joann fabrics chichis giant eagle hell compusa chichis and pharmor dont even exist anymore im not sure if kmarts are still in business dead malls are sad for some reason walking through this mall just creepy though|truly the worst mall in america  going here is like being in a time machine though  there is a store called s nails for goodness sakeshow is this place even still standing  for one im pretty sure its built on an old mine or dig or something  my mom has told me you can feel the ground move when you are here  yikesthe sports deli is actually a gem of a store though  man the rent has to be so cheapi got to give a shout out to petland i think thats what it iswas called the pet store in this mall where we got our maltese pup snoflake  years ago  what a great dog  |honestly i dont consider this place a mall i consider it to be the entryway i have to use to get into kmart sadly there are a few stores left still lingering around but hey im sure the rent is reasonable considering the land is falling apart calling it a mall is like calling me an athlete it simply isnt true when you can lists off the name of the stores on your fingers and still have a few left over then you need to go somewhere else|oy vey stay away theres nothing here to see kmart phantom of the attic and a lottery place this mall is dead deader than dead dead dead|avoid at all costs  they diluted my wine with water the food was mushy they charged me  for marinara sauce from a can without informing us beforehand this injustice would be taking place  typical big corporation cut costs down to last nickel and inflate the prices so the ceo can fly in his private jet after landing eat at a real italian restaurant and purchase a new bentley each year  visit deblasios restaurant for twice the portions it is much cheaper as wellworst experience at a restaurant ever|went to the green tree olive garden for their buy onetake one special  their salads and breadsticks are the only real reason to go there anymore  all of their menu items are frozen sitting in a freezer until you order them then theyre pulled out microwaved and served  i mean if i wanted to eat microwaved food id go to the freezer section of my grocery store and shop there  seriously if you want good breadsticks  salad go here but thats the only reason  id rather take the extra time  make real pasta at home using my own sauce|rooms were clean and the amenities were fine my problem is that the hotel double charged me for my stay i reserved my room over the phone with the holiday inn hotline and was charged exactly what they quoted when i get home to virginia i discover the hotel charged me again for the same stay but i different amount i only stayed one night and was charged twice i was on the phone with  different people connected with holiday inn none of them were of any help they could either see one charge or the other depending on who was looking they told me to call back another time when i am working they insinuated i didnt know what i was talking about all i want is to get an answer and none of these people can give an answer this will be the last time i stay at any holiday innadd on the wifi is awful|this used to be the holiday inn and now it is the clarion hotel  conference center  we needed to find a place not too far from heinz stadium for a reasonable price we paid about  per night for this place and the experience started poorly we walked in and the two lobby tvs were tuned to judge judy for the front desk employees viewing pleasure employees watching reality tv during business hours really puts me off it was hard to get the attention of the front desk staff because they were in the middle of a pizza order  two of the staff was working the front desk with a third suggesting toppings it was pretty funny as one of clerks started to set up our room while another on the phone to the pizzeria kept interrupting the process with pizza questions to the side the third clerk assisted with the pizza order my wife pointed out her extreme cleavage but i did not want to get lost there we had a hard time understanding our clerk setting up the room she tended to mumble but did assert herself better when responding to pizza order questions we finally got our room and headed up the very scary elevator to the th floor in a way i felt as if we were at some sort of slum i kept looking for gang tagging the room was adequate and i believe this was a renovated room but a motel  would be an upgrade whoever is doing the renovation has really poor taste and the quality of work is terrible the swimming pool was a swamp i am not kidding but i am sure the frogs living in it were having a good time the next morning we went down to the front desk again this time the morning clerk was on a personal call and gave me an angry look because she felt that i was interrupting her call  she did not even hang up she just put the phone to her side answered my question and then continued her conversation personally i think this hotel would be great for a horror movie and hollywood should contact this place it needs to be knocked down or management should tighten up the staff and improve construction quality if construction is on track and i suspect something is wrong get staff that really is gracious to customers there are people that need jobs out there and i assure you with proper management they will do a great job dont stay here for over  per night the price is due to the breakfast offered personally i would not stay here until they fix the place but for some reason i dont feel that it will ever happen something just feels wrong perhaps clarion has stopped the remodel due to the economy|umm lol so seriously i read some reviews about this place and was like noooo it cant be that bad ha hadude so this spot is like mad cheap but really first we check in and notice the are undergoing some much needed renovations checkin was seamless as it should be we get to out room  and after reading the reviews i know to check the beds immediately the first bed legit has hair under the sheetsstrike  as im pulling the covers back on the second bed i find two quartersthats right folks obviously left by the last guest intentionally to warn the next occupants that the sheets havent been changedlet alone checked i mean really you couldnt at lease have made it look like you did your jobswe go to the desk and make them aware of the issue they apologetically get us another room this room is better its evident by the way these beds were made that the room has been cleaned the elevator by the desk is stuck on the rd floor lol death trap so we take the stairs thank god for yelpyouve all been warned lol seriously|nightmare  its a ghost town needles in parking lot lobby is a hotel room with undesirables hanging around asked to see our rooms before checking in given the key room was filthy  saw a sticky note re bedbugs  bolted as fast as possible|this was technically the clarion hotel so i think the name is wrong on the page id like to start by saying that im not much of a complainer but if could have given  stars i would have so we are on our way up to room when we passed a vending machine with water underneath it i assumed it was leaking and brushed it off i dont care that much about little things like that especially since we were just sleeping there after a great hockey game and a bar crawl we came back to the hotel and got ready for bed there was absolutely no hot water for my shower so cold i wouldnt even consider hopping in really quick it was late so i let it go and decided to try again in the morning when i woke up it was the same thing at this point i was fuming i need a shower manso i put on my angry pants and headed down the hall towards the elevator right in front of the elevator door there is a water fall pouring out of the ceiling from the third floor what the hell is pretty much what i was thinking at this point well there was my shower considering i had to walk through it to continue on my quest as soon as the elevator doors open to the first floor i see the hallway is flooded the carpet is squishing beneath my feet all the way to the front desk where other angry people had beaten me to apparently a pipe had burst the day before and they had neglected to tell us that when we had checked in i was so mad i managed to get  off our bill and i made her call to check us in at another hotel i would have insisted the whole bill be paid for but im really bad at being mean to people all in all i will never stay here or any other branch of this hotel again|im not sure i can even give this place one star to be fair the room we had was clean and comfortable it did seem as if we had entered a time warp though furnishings and bedding from the sif not s ive seen this place rated up to  stars on some websites id like to know their qualificationswhen you first approach the hotel it looks closed down and write obviously it should be you enter through a side entrance with hand written signs theoffice is a room right inside the doors the hallway looks a wreck oh yeahtheyre under construction dirt filth and stains everywhere electrical wires exposed smoke detectors hanging down you look at all this and wonder how in the world are they passing codes or are they hmmmmlike i saidthe room was betteralthough not without faults the lights over the bathroom sink did not work and the shower did not work well the tv was definitely a s model wireless internet what a joke when we reported the bathroom issues they said they would move us to another room since we were only staying  nights we thought we would stay and just have maintenance look at it in the morning we were informed maintenance would not be in tomorrow our everwe told the lady working the front desk that this hotel was pretty scary her reply was  yeah we get that a lot|this was by far the worst hotel experience ive ever had it wasnt just that there was massive construction going on but they did nothing to accommodate for it they put us in a dirty floor with exposed ceilings spackle and sheetrock everywhere the lights were broken and the room was filthy the second room they out me in had an air conditioning unit that wouldnt reach the outlet rendering it useless in the middle of the summer had no toilet paper and water all over the bathroom floor the children working the front desk which was located in a hotel room gave the worst customer service greeted me with an attitude and couldnt manage to pull themselves away from their own conversation long enough to even check me in in a timely manner the worst do not stay here|wish i could give this place negative stars where to begin it begins with no signs saying where the hotel is at and then it goes into their temporary lobby which is a room turned into an office the whole place is under construction which wouldnt be so bad but my gosh they have crap everywhere that leads us to the elevator norman bates would even say its too creepy for him its marked with two different hotel names on top of that holiday inn and ramada then the room not the worst of the worst the decor is nice the bed is as hard as a rock and the shower isnt even properly installed really wish i would have looked at yelp before booking here buyer beware oh yea and i knew they were under construction before we booked in june and we were promised that the construction would be done before hand extremely disappointed|dont even think about staying at this hotel if the option of giving a zero were available i would definitely use it i travel for a living have stayed in hotels being renovated before but this was the worst experience ive ever had rude staff front desk attendant was wrapped in a blanket watching a move and had her feet propped up on the counter she couldnt tear herself away from the movie to address me construction sure this hotel had  full gas cans to the left of the front door an empty case of beer and cans right beside that and over flowing trash cans as you walked in filthy would be a step up from the actual conditions it hasnt been cleaned in months it smelled of paint and chemicalswhen i raised these concerns with the front desk clerk she said that there was no manager to meet with to discuss the conditions and that it was only the owner and he knew of the state of the place and didnt care i made my reservation on bookingcom called them immediately and sent photos to document the experience|ah yes what has yet to be said about this clarion in greentree which is commonly known as the hotel of perpetual construction check the reviews folks i sure wish i had and youll see that this place has been under construction for at least four yearsmy family and im sure countless others initially had trouble even finding the place and had to humble ourselves to ask directions at the nearby doubletree hotel but even with directions we drove right past the clarion because  there are no hotel signs  we were arriving at night and the building was completely dark  there were no parked cars visible from the road and  the entire front of the building was boarded upwhen we located the correct driveway and approached the construction zone which once represented the entrance to the hotel we saw a tiny sign directing us to the temporary lobby in the back of the hotel the makeshift lobby consisted of a hotel room with a clerk sitting at a desk the clerk initially could not locate our reservation on her computer but found it as soon i had dug through my luggage to find a copy of the confirmation emailwe were given a room on the second floor thus we walked past stairwells that were closed because of endlessly drying wet paint and an outoforder and leaking ice machine until we located the elevator well let me tell you folks disneys tower of terror ride is less frightening than this elevator it looked like one of those service elevators that the public never sees the floor was covered in dead bugs and the ceiling had holes in it leading to the conclusion that someone must have taken the globes off the ceiling lights and just dumped the dead bugs onto the floorwhen we got to our room the carpet was so covered with nasty grease stains that we wanted to keep our shoes on we did the preliminary check of the beds and found some stained sheets but thankfully no bugs we also checked for the free wifi signal and found that it was completely useless maybe thats why the desk clerk couldnt locate our reservationfinding the complimentary breakfast in the morning was like a scavenger hunt where you look for clues on small paper signs in the hallways the adventure actually took me outside of the hotel and then back into another part of the building thankfully it wasnt raining like it had been all night i then realized that i had just entered the main construction zone and the outside route must be the only passable route to the dining areathere was yet another sign outside the dining room which said something about complementary breakfast and the strange phrase gratuity included but inside the dining room there were at least two clearlymarked tip jars now ive been at some pretty trashy hotels in my travels but ive never seen a tip jar in the dining room ive also never been in a hotel dining room where it looked like a bomb had gone off but there were drop cloths power tools and all sorts of debris everywherewhen i got in line for the grub i learned how the attendant earned her tips she was there to help patrons identify the food the person in front of me inquired about the graylooking sausagelike links and was dutifully informed that they represented turkey sausage adding because clarion cares about your health im not kidding who could make something like that up anyway i tried this socalled health food because the only other hot alternative was french toast and i did not want any syrupy food that morning guess what the sausage had some kind of sugary additive to make the links taste like syrup real healthy right thus i ended up just getting a cup of coffee and returning to my room to pack up the coffee was okay by the wayin conclusion i would not have stayed at the greentree clarion had i not made prior reservations and had not been coming back after midnight following a music festival where it rained all day plus we used our loyalty points for this room so i couldnt even request a discountbelieve me hud would shut this place down if it was an apartment building and the dept of homeland security would never even consider housing immigrants there but of course you and i are welcome to pay upwards of a hundred bucks a night to stay there|i wish i didnt have to give even  star horrible service i ordered family dinner for  plus  extra sides i got sighs and eye rolls from the cook and the girl waiting on me i got home and no extra sides i paid for them but they didnt put them in the bag i called and was told that they would send me a card for family dinner for  since they charged me for items not received i called again on july nd as they never sent anything i spoke with autumn who advised me that she was a manager and would send out a gift card as previously promised still have not received so if you choose this location make sure to check your order because they love to charge you for items you wont receive and have no follow through i would be happy to get my  back this started on june th terrible servce we went there at least x a month and had no problem spending money but id rather spend that  somewhere else mediocre food horrible service zero follow through my advice avoid this place|junk worse than mcdonald my wife is a fan of this shop in fairfax va westopped for a quick breakfast the poppers were stale bagels hard and the worst thing was when they heated the egg omlette in the microwave for someone who does not use this at home was a shock threw the stuff into the trash can the whole thing cost you decide if it was worth it|horrible experience again made sandwich wrong for rd visit will never be back ever|service is terrible waited for  minutes for a bagel with cream cheese with no line|its sad i used to get such great service at this location today both girls behind the counter were so rude and had zero personality after waiting about  minutes for a bagel and a sandwich she yelled my order and basically threw the bag at me over the counter i live right around the corner and will not go back there again they may want to look into getting some new team members who value their job and understand the value of customer service|easter sunday store is open until  i arrive at  employee is feverishly sweeping at carpet in front of counter in presence of customers seated and eating  dust is flying everywhere  customers eyes are rolling  i tell counter person she asks employee to scale back he refuses only two types of bagels are left even though the store is to remain open for another  hours i get a cinnamon raisin bagel with strawberry cream cheese it was good and a medium coffee  i go to get the vanilla hazelnut coffee and manage to get a half cup before the dispenser is entry  i say something to clerk  she tells me to get regular coffee and she will put hazelnut syrup in it  what  she never offered to brew new coffee even though the store is to remain open for another  hour   never again will i go to this location|worst effin starbucks on the block and their baristas suck at making drinks horrible customer service and they always screw up our orders i just dont understand why theyre so lazy i understand their comprehension level is low because of the lack of education though but if you hate your job dont take it out on the loyal customers your life sucks we get it but you have one job at starbucks so do it right its not hard|came here for a quick breakfast on our way from the hotel to fallingwater and regretted the decision immenselyextremely long lines and poorly trained staff as a former employee i know about staff roles and approximately how long it should take to receive your drink this staff was not trained at all and it was clear that they were overwhelmed with the crowd it took me  minutes for me to receive my order there were  customers in front of me and my order was incorrect i ordered a small coffee medium latte a croissant and a sausage breakfast sandwich i know that the sausage sandwiches heat up for about  seconds in oven so i cant comprehend why it took so long to get my order would never come here again i also received a warm cheese danish instead of my croissant first the warm creamy colored goo in the middle is extremely unappetizing and second they looked so dejected when i pointed out that i ordered a croissant i almost just leftdo not recommend|i went to princess nails for a fill the nail technician was a man he was a complete sshole first he grabbed my handarm across the tablethere was maam can you stretch your arm further across the table it was just an abrupt aggressive grab ok im more than slightly annoyed  this pointnext the guy asks me to pick a color i tell him that i brought my own polish which was a bright neon yellow color the guy says how much he hates the color yellowok who asked your opinion and proceeds to tell me how much he hates polishing nails w yellowcontinues to be aggressive and rudeim pissed  this pointfinal point stay far away from this spotthere is another nail shop right next door they were crazy busybut never again will i ever go to princess nailsthey have shitty techs shitty color choices and the entire environment is small and dirty btw the eyebrow techs skills are highly overrated|i shouldve believed what was already written but it was close to my hotel the worst manipedi of my life im  im a flight attendant ive been to a lot of nail salons i swear she wasnt licensed she had no clue but claims to have been doing nails for  years she clearly needs to retire and the male owner was an a he says not everyone does it the same well they certainly should come close no cuticle push back didnt know how to remove gel polish didnt file straight or smooth didnt clean under my nails after lotion i had to tell her to take alcohol to my nails to clean off lotion and remind her to use a base coat then she polished all over my cuticle  hours later having done nothing but sleep workout and shower the polish is chipped off  nails|i guess this will be my last good review for princess nails unfortunately the worst possible thing has happened i have one eyebrow its slowly growing back but the idea of having to pencil in my eyebrow everyday is starting to get to me unfortunately i dont know what happened michelle are you going blind are you okay obviously you left me with completely a mishapen eyebrows which i had to have someone else fix because you botched mine i cried i weeped i found myself in the fetal position im no longer going back i know some people have off days but this was bad|the worst nail place i have ever gone to there was no message when doing my pedicure they didnt clip my toe nails and barley filed them same for my finger nails there was still dirt under my nails they were not clipped or shaped the atmosphere is gross and unsanitary the worst was withing a minute of walking out the door an entire nail fell off  was just paint no acrylics or anything i would have gone back to fix it but it had already taked  hours just to get those done within the hour i lost  full nails the paint didnt stick at all it was blobby and bad looking there was paint all over the sides of my nails awful place very bad expierience not to mention the prices are jacked up as high as they can make them|went in to get my gel nails taken off and they straight up just told me no no fine thats money out of their pocket and i will never set foot in that diseased infested looking store|by far the worst shellac manicure i have ever had i went down on my lunch break for a quick mani first the woman rushed through my manicure im not sure they have any type of sanitizer for their instruments as she kept pulling things out of her drawer the manicure was very quick and not at all thorough once she started to paint my nails she kept having to fix them because she was in a such a rush she took off polish that was on the nail and then pushed my hand into the uv dryer when she went to put the top coat on my shellac she put the foundation coat on  of my nails before she realized and wouldnt fix them saying they will be fine during the entire process she did about  eyebrow waxes and then would forget where she was in my process she also kept forgetting to turn on the uv dryer to the point where she walked away and i had to turn it ondo not go here if i could give it  stars i would|do not go here was almost electrocutedits  i have a smart phone i have the yelp app i really should have known better to walk in here i should have known to walk out when i actually did walk in there its the size of a closet completely messy and disorganized but you know how some dive bars have charm i was thinking this place might be like that noi sat down in the chair for pedicure bin filled to the brim with soap suds thats not how its done in philly i never get sudsy water woman takes off my toe nail polish she gets up and plugs in a nail buffer a foot away from the bin of water and was about to take my foot out of the water to buff my toe nails outlet socket bin of water i immediately told her not to she said it was fine i said absolutely nother next move was to take tools out of a janky old plastic box unsterilized i asked are those sterilized she said quickly ok ok for you i will sterilize for me shouldnt you be doing this for all of your clients i got up and left with soap suds all over my nails went to salon nuvo instead and had an infinitely better experience health department should definitely check in on princess nails shady and terribly run nail salon surprised someone hasnt been hurt yet|i got a good haircut here a few months ago so this onestar review is not intended for the stylists  it is a response to a strict noreturns policy on salon products which makes me pretty mad i couldnt have known they recommended the wrong product without trying it and now that i tried it they wont refund my purchase  catch  i came in to buy a replacement for my normal bumble and bumble curl creme for thick hair and was told by the receptionist that bumble and bumbles defining creme for fine curls is the new packaging of that product which seemed weird to begin withthick hairfine curls nope its totally different and it doesnt work for me  i used it twice figured that out and now im stuck with an expensive product i cant use i called bumble and bumble and they told me that the product i use has been discontinued  all my previous salons in other cities would have honored a return in this situation  i wont be back to mcn|today i definitely didnt have a great experience at mcn i got my haircut couple months ago from there and i liked it so i decided to go again for coloring todayi wasnt happy about it at all cuz i can still see the line btw my root and the bottom plus they charged me  bucks more for the blowdry without telling me i wish i didnt go there for the color|im not sure if i will return to mcn salon however the haircut i received was not the source of my disappointment and annoyance with mcn upon my arrival i was offered coffee by my stylist prepared just as i pleased i was instructed to leave my belongings in the coat room and put on a robe in doing so i left my coffee on the side of the counter at the front of the salon i was quickly ushered to the back for my shampoo condition and kerastase treatment i realized i forgot my cup and went back to the front to retrieve it as i politely ask the woman behind the desk if she saw it she cuts me off mid sentence to inform me that she has thrown it away and gives me a sneer as i look at her in bewilderment as to how to handle her rudeness she rolls her eyes and asks if i still want something to drink um yes thats why im looking for my cup now she then instructs me that im not to wait for her to finish making the drink and that she will deliver it to my chair yeah no never did that but she did take the time to come over to my stylist glare at me and inform my stylist that the next client was here rude i thanked my stylist for her time and pay for my cut and style only then did i realize that my friend should have also received a free kerastase treatment because of mcns birthday special they charged her the standard  well the woman  behind the counter basically told me that she needed to see proof that the email offer existed why didnt i have to show some email to get the free treatment she was basically giving my asian friend a terribly difficult time between me and my friends we have spent over  at your salon and you are going to treat loyal clients as so i also believe that this salon desperately needs a dress code enforced for all staff if you go to mcn take a look around you will agree with me finally leave your pooches at home i dont particularly like the large dog that roams around and slobers on the leg of my pants during my appointment  star but thank you to my stylist for a great cut  stars for you|very sloppy no attention the polish is all over my fingers so disappointing and aggravating that now im going to have to pay more money else where to get them redone|i have been sitting here looking at the poor quality of my shellac manicure and i just had to write i walked in to kennys nail salon this afternoon and was pleased that there wasnt a wait they also provided very friendly customer servicehowever my manicure looks terrible it looks like i painted my nails myself only even i could do better the paint and clear gel is all over the underside of my nails and baked on no less im even finding paint on my fingers now the nail technician a female didnt even touch my cuticles but she did use an electric file to shave down the nail bed i guess thats supposed to count for the cuticles no frills no hand massage not even any moisturizer or cuticle oil or anythingi am horrified i was charged  and then i even tipped  now im wishing i would have asked them to start over perhaps with a different nail technician i wont be going back however at least i was in and out in  minutes but what a terrible job|i would put  star if it was possible the worse manicure in my life i decided to try salon todayi ask for a manicure and chinese man shrieks at me what color you want he has long gross fingernails with dirt underneathhe picks out said dirt while massaging my hands with some oil stuff he painted my nails and when he was done i looked down in horror it looked like a child had done it the bottom was so sloppy i had nail polish on my skin of my fingers and it just looked horribly unprofessional i had to be somewhere right after my appointment after i said to him thats is not a good job he just grab my hand and pure polish remover on my finger and start screaming in chinese language i was in shock this guy is out of control its definitely something wrong with him he cant be around people  people be ware do not go there |ould put  star if it was possible the worse manicure in my life i decided to try salon todayi ask for a manicure and chinese man shrieks at me what color you want he has long gross fingernails with

be ware do not go there |visiting downtown pittsburgh for a wedding so i scheduled an appointment for myself and two friends for manipedis  the first strike was that when i made an appointment for three people at the same time they did not let me know that only  nail techs were available so me and my friends were not able to have our nails done at the same time looked like they only had  total and one spent his time watching a movie on his ipad while he took care of another customer  also a heads up  only  pedicure chairs in the place  the pedicure was the shortest i have ever received they spent barely any time massaging or rubbing  the nail tech also sent me to the manicure chair without painting my toe nails and told me she would do them later  she later had me put my feet in her lap and she painted my toenails in the manicure chair  during my manicure the nail tech made two of my fingers bleed while she was trimming my cuticles  not only did she not apologize she lectured me on how i should be taking better care of my cuticlesmy nails are in great shape and even if they were not you just made me bleed  two days later i still have sore fingers  very limited color selection definitely not worth |my food was plain and boring our service was subpar we asked for water when we first got there and it didnt show up until shortly before we got our check the dumb ass waitress spilled water on the floor by our table but didnt bother cleaning it up so when one of the older ladies that was joining me got up she slipped and fell the manager on duty did apologize but that was it there was no offer of a comp or anything and she basically turned around and went on about her business despite us pointing out to her that there was water on the floor that caused the fall fortunately no one was seriously injured but i really dont think that the staff handled the situation with any sort of intelligence or empathy the place was noisy and it was pricey|im staying at the hotel at which the soho is located and i thought it would be a convenient place to eat dinner well it was overpriced and the food was terrible i ordered the chicken parm pasta and got it to go to my room the pasta looked and tasted like it was days old and soggy the chicken was overdone dry and the tiny super tiny roll was dry and stale very bad food and overpriced not only was the food a huge disappointment but the bartender who took my order was unfriendly and not helpful she then began to pour beer from the tap into a glass and sprayed beer on me and didnt say a word though i met eye contact with her as soon as it happened she was more interested in talking with the other waitressesyou know she got a great tip try another place for food even if you have to step outside of the hotel there are a bunch of places to eat across the street and at the baseball stadium that is right next to the hotelatrias was pretty good and very nice wait staff httpwwwatriascom|i wish i could give this place no stars we sat for lunch after a lunch rush there were  other table in the restaurant besides ours we ordered a blt with chili and a cesar salad hour latler a stale blt and chili that looked like it had been sitting there for  hours comes out i was still waiting for my cesar salad the chili was cold and the blt bread was so hard you couldnt bite into it when we asked to speak to the manager the waitress got very defensive the manager came over and explained that is their food and how its made so he wasnt sure of the problem after an argument going back and forth ensued he agreed to comp the meals here is the kicker hahawe were going to leave the waitress a tip because clearly it was not her fault however she came over and asked if our problem was resolved we said yes and then she rolled her eyes and walked away no tip for you my friend this is not how you do business especially when there are other options besides soho to choose from for lunch|nice looking place and the worst service ive had in the last  years   after waiting  minutes to have a bartender at a less than half full bar acknowledge us we then ordered and the drinks arrived  hope you only need one round because after waiting  minutes to try to order a second round we paid with exact change to save us from wasting another hours of our life   it is hard to explain how oblivious the bar tenders were|no redeeming qualities here schwill on tap food was terrible  had the pizza mac  cheese bites and spinach  artichoke dip  it was hardly edible stay away|stayed at the springhill suites for  days for pirates games they wouldnt let us eat inside with a  yr old at pm and when we walked through the restaurant to get back to our room there were many children running around so we ate outside service  was lousy molly didnt make eye contact and acted like it was a pain to serve us food was crappy we got potstickers and firecracker shrimp kid got the chicken fingers food was fried which was expected but it looked and tasted like frozen food very salty batter was not tasty sauces were  borderline tasteless would never go back and would not recommend this place|stayed  the hotel ordered sirloin steaks no steak knife no mashed potatoes no asparagus as ordered so check your order i mean for a  person  meal with tip i would hope the waitstaff would deliver on what was ordered  asked before we left but skip the   room service fee  httpwwwsohopittsburghcom walk downstairs|i got a cobb salad prior to pirate game almost no lettuce chicken had to be frozen and microwaved warmdaughter got buffalo chicken wrap tasted poor not even my  year son would eat it he eats anything|menu in the room said  price apps pm everyday menu in the elevator said  price apps pm everyday menu at the restaurant read  price apps pm everyday everyday mind you on all of the menus guess what not when there is a game i was told what does that mean pirates steelers penguins etc what day is there not a game what a joke they do not have  price apps somewhat slow service and somewhat overpriced  burgers  domestic bottles look elsewhere there is a lot surrounding this place so you have options|if youre dying for the recipe for their buffalo macaroni and cheese than look no further it was definitely some sort of boxed mac  cheese with a chicken tender covered in franks red hot on top  i have much higher expectations for food in a city that offers so many delicious options i could have gotten an incredible mac  cheese at meat and potatoes for less money|so when i walked in to soho last month for happy hour a person in my party made a casual comment that this place never seems that busy when they walk by it little did we know that our group would discover exactly why this is the case during our visit its especially noteworthy that i came with a large group that made a reservation with specific instructions about what we wanted our evening plans had been made well in advance and soho knew  or should have known  exactly how many people would be in our party and when we would arrive most of all they should have known we had not only asked for a table to be ready we had asked for water and very specific appetizers to be ready for our group as we would be hungry after the event we enjoyed before the happy hour well as you can probably guess from my rating making a reservation and discussing and confirming our needs with the staff well in advance made absolutely no difference in the quality of our visit in fact i can summarize my entire visit here in two words we waitedwe waited for them to confirm we had a table after we walked in at  we waited for the sever to come after they finally confirmed that yes a reservation had been made we waited for the server yet again after asking for drink menus we waited for these drinks and for water and we waited for our preordered appetizers absolutely nothing arrived in a timely manner in the  minutes that i waited with the group all i got was a water none of the preordered appetizers even arrived while i was there and many people waited  to  minutes for their other drinks i was honestly astounded at how much the staff missed the mark with our reservations and requests so i gave up and left at  to find a better venue that was interested in providing me with a relaxing friday night mealand all of that was on a night where the place was mostly empty i cant even imagine what the service must be like if its actually busy  and i certainly wont be back to find out|terrible been sitting at the bar for  minutes yet to be even looked at by a bartender terrible not even busy not recommended at all terrible service or lack there of|for a place that has a  entree i was pretty shocked to see a  charge for blue cheese olives on my bill pretty tacky   that was definitely a first  i was disappointed the waitress didnt say anything either aside from that the service was pretty good and the sashimi was a great value  but everything else about this place is shwag  the seared tuna  garbage rainbow roll and caesar salad  weak  and the sides incredibly small  the place has the feel of a riverboat buffet  if this was stand alone they would only get away with charging  of what they are now in the westini would skip it or if you have to get sashimi at the bar and make sure you review your bill|having read positive things about ofm lately i thought wed give it another try as its been years since weve eaten there  unfortunately our experience was dreadfuli knew going in that the food was overpriced  always has been  but not only can you get less expensive fishseafood elsewhere but you also can get fresher food at other places  our food tasted frozen and overcooked  what has not changed is the extremely poor service  if you dont look wealthy or if youre not buying multiples rounds of alcohol the wait staff avoids you  and that was our experience the other night  how can restaurants get away with poor service and bland food at such high prices  i guess ofm lives off the travelers and not the locals|hotel restaurants are just awful  its like you have to be mediocre to have a restaurant inside a hotel  i dont get it  wouldnt they want you to stay and spend money on their property nevertheless this place in the westin hotel is no different  for starters the place is sorely outdated  the decorations look like theyre straight out of an s music video  i went with my mom who asked me if the glass sculptures on the ceiling where chihulys  i almost choked on my bread when she asked i always go for sushi when its on the menu at a fish place  i cant get away from it plus i need my weekly or sometimes daily fill of it  so i ordered a spicy yellow tail roll and a ginger salad  the spicy yellow tail was not spicy  it had a side of spicy sauce  im not too sure that qualifies it to be spicy with a dab of sauce  the salads ginger dressing was awful and watery  i love ginger dressing when its done right  but it was not happening at this place the thing that really made me mad is that the place is overpriced to begin with  my tiny yellow tail roll was more expensive  than the fabu penn ave fish co  rolls  and def not as good  my mom ordered a bowl of fish soup  this bowl was a deep dish salad bowl and looked as if there was a small ladle size serving  it was hardly halfway full  thats all my mom had ordered for lunch  it was pretty sad looking  so she asked for a little more from the server  the server said thats all she could give her because it was restaurant policy  now let me tell youive worked at restaurants  ive witnessed the people who eat their entire meal then say it was bad and want another oneand they get another one  now thats messed up  asking for a little more soup thats supposed to be a bowl but looks more like a spoonful is hardly too much to ask for needless to say i will not be back there are way better fish places in the city to fill my belly with hands down go to penn ave fish co its opened a new location right on fifth ave dont say i didnt warn you| dollars for  people   small cups of lukewarm soup  tuna sushimi  waters and  seafood pasta  salmon  it all had no taste|terriblei visited this restaurant for the first time yesterday to use up a groupon  thank god i didnt pay full price for this slop  first lets talk about the decor  others have commented about the outdated s look of the place i concur  the chairs are ridiculously heavy and uncomfortable  and dont even get me started on the hideous glass constructions hanging from the ceiling  second let talk about the staff  unprofessional to say the least  when we were waiting for our table i witnessed the hostess yell at a man from across the restaurant instead of walking up to him and guiding him to his party  hey anthony your partys over here  ridiculous this restaurant has an open kitchen which is usually a good thing  but not when everyones yelling at each other  we were seated near the kitchen and im not exaggerating heard someone yell order approximately every  seconds  staff yelled at each other from across the restaurant constantly  i felt like i was on a playground  our waitress was a nice sweet girl and she did the best she could considering the environment she was in  i have no complaints about her  the food though jesus  we started with the margarita shrimp cocktail  imagine tiny round pieces of popcorn shrimp floating in a glass of lime flavored water  these were served with tortilla chips which youd think were meant to be used to scoop up the shrimp from the glass  but the shrimp are solid round balls not a scoopable salsa  we tried picking up the shrimp with the chips but theyd just roll off and end up on the floor  my date and i just laughed as we tried to eat this concoction  when it finally made it into our mouths it was gross anyway  my boyfriend ordered a sushisashimi combo platter  im being generous by giving it a rating of mediocre  take out sushi from a grocery store is better  now i admit i made the mistake here  i ordered the fried fish platter  im used to getting a variety at seafood restaurants  at a place like mitchells fish market you can get a dish with a piece of fish a few scallops a few shrimp and a vegetable  the original fish market has no such dish  the only dish i could get that had more than just one piece of fish with some plain steamed white rice and steamed spinach was the fried fish platter  so i ordered that with a side of green beans vegetables were    extrathe description said i would get a piece of tilapia scallops oysters shrimp and french fries  i didnt realize this meant that the tilapia was fried the scallops were fried the oysters were fried and the shrimp was fried all on top of a giant bed of fried french fries  its just not what i pictured  like i said it was my mistake for not reading carefully and not asking the waitress but lets say for arguments sake that this is what i wanted  it was still disgusting  the batterflavor was exactly the same for everything  the scallops tasted like the french fries  the shrimp tasted like the french fries the tilapia tasted like the french fries  i didnt even try the oysters but im pretty sure they would have tasted like french fries  i ate barely a quarter of this dish and im pretty sure i consumed an entire weeks worth of saturated fat  if you ate this entire plate i think a heart attack would interrupt your dessertthe green beans were good other people commented that you cant count on hotel restaurants being worthwhile  i have to agree  if everyones just passing through you dont have to worry about actually impressing anyone and getting them to come back  and with business travelers theyre usually paying with their companys dime so they dont bother to complain or expect muchi have learned my lesson  im not coming back  and i seriously question the sanity of people who gave this place more than two stars|i have never had such awful inedible food at such an appallingly ridiculous price its not only a failure in execution the plates are very poorly put together and the flavors of the sides and sauces with the protein do not marry well at all i was severely disappointed by plating and then just got mad when i started eatingyou would think for  your steak would at least be properly cooked what was supposed to be medium came raw the steak was tough and tasteless ahi tuna asked rare was overcooked also bland even with the sauce the oshinko side was laughable seriously i laughed  pasta was overcooked and by the time it got to us the sauce was laminated with coagulating fat the sushi was an amatuer attempt at best  there was too much rice and presentation was sad ambience is tacky ugly sreminiscent wallpaper covers half the room and framed sketches of fish plaster the other halfservice was the only redeeming quality to put it in perspective my neighborhood houlihans seems gourmet next to this place|we were staying at the westin and it was late and the original fish market was right on site well the experience at both the hotel and the restaurant was dismal we waited too long to be seated and the hosted seemed to have attitude when we asked one of the servers to find her a simple sorry for the wait would have been nice we were about to leave after waiting  mins for a waiter unfortunately we did not  the food was all bland and tasteless oh except for the bold taste of obay on the fries i had blackened rainbow trout  i expected a bold favors but yet nothing it was not even blackened  looked like paprika for color but that was it  mash potatoes were dry and tasted gritty like it came from a box we skipped dessert for obvious reasons i am not adverse to paying top dollar for a great meal i hate paying top dollar for a lousy meal that i could have done better myselfdo yourself a favor and avoid the original fish market  i was generous to give one star|terrible crab bisque my husband liked the fish stew though  it had lots of beans was thick and chililike the rest of the lunch was so unnoteworthy i cant remember what i ordered though almost all of it was still on the plate at the end of lunch  i do remember the bad taste in my mouth for the rest of the day|i went for lunch last week  the food was awful  do not waste your money at this restaurant|literally the worst restaurant experience that ive ever had including mcdonalds and hour scarfandbarf dinerspittsburgh is undergoing a bit of a food renaissance yet the original fish market continues to put out an inferior product in a horrendous atmosphere at an obscene price  our fish was tasteless and rubbery my white wine came out at room temperature the restaurant was extremely dirty and our server was clearly apathetic  the original fish market opened in  and quickly found a place in the market in a city where red lobster was still considered good seafood  as topnotch restaurants entered the market the local palates grew up in a big way  the original fish market seems content to remain frozen in time competing as a mediocre option in an under served market space  unfortunately for them their market space is now flooded with options offering a far superior product  at a fraction of the price|this place used to have decent fresh fish for lunch and the only wild salmon for lunch in the city but the new chef and the new menu for lunch are horrible  one of the crazy dishes of fish was on a bed of some type of cold pasta and while the fish was good the cold pasta was soooo bad i spit it out and just ate bread and fish   also the new menu focuses on nonfish dishes  why  this is a fish restaurant so  of the menu should be fish  also the menu changes now every day so you cant go in and get a favorite dish  if you want fish they have some new screwy fish dish that changes almost everyday or certainly every week  the fish dishes were so bad i switched to a fish salad but they were not great either  i had eaten at this restaurant for lunch at least once a week for over a year getting some type of fish with rice and spinach which i loved and was so good but new chef and especially the new menu i will never go back again|seriously terrible  just all around terribleweve been to the ofm twice now the first visit was acceptable but the second was absolutely terrible  we had late reservations for a quick bite after a lovely night at the oreilly to celebrate my husbands birthday  as sushi lovers we thought this would be a great way to end the celebration  we sat at the sushi bar and couldnt get the attention of our waitress or the sushi chef  after an exhausting  min wait in our seats and just as i was about to go find someone we finally were able to place our order  again waiting waiting  oh our wait was enhanced by guests of the hotel tweens loaded with makeup from what appeared to be dance competition and their drunk parents standing behind us no they were not eating they were just standing there yelling at pm  our server returned to bring my husbands glass of warm white wine and commented on how terrible our experience must be but did nothing to help no drink refills no offer to call the manager nothing   hubby sent the  glass of bath water i mean wine back to the bar only to have it replaced with you guessed it another glass of warm white wine  our sushi was finally ready and it was edible but not enjoyable  no flavor in the fish and hard rice  we left before finishing our  meal  glass of wine  water  roll  orders of sashimi  i almost asked for the manager but frankly was tired of waiting and just wanted to get out of there  to top it off we paid  for valet parking that would not be validated unless we spent  at the restaurant  we will not give it another chance and suggest you dont give it a first|this place really should be much higher quality for first the prices and second the only food option at the westin  i stopped by here two nights ago on a work trip to grab some food  the wine that i ordered was out which was fine and substituted  but for a place with a giant wine cellar i wouldnt suspect that should be an issue for the glass wineswhen i went to order i asked the server how the scallops were  and asked her to be honest  she said that they are the most well done in pittsburgh  well i think she meant that literally because the scallops were as tough as a tire and there presentation was poor with a pile of over salty spinach and some kinds of blobs smeared around the plate  i was a little bummed about my experience when the  dollar bill came for one entree and a glass of winealso a one off thing but the overhead light on the table was like a k watt surgical spotlight  it actually hurt my eyes to look at the table it was so bright  that should be an easy adjustment for the management  food quality on the other hand  you need a new chef|didnt eat herethis review not about the food  we went on friday night around pm there seemed to be about  occupancy  the hostess asked us if we had a reservation we didnt  and she told us that they were somewhat behind and that we would have to wait  minutes  wtf  we immediately left and frankly its not worth going back again  shame the fish was good there crappy hostess for sure|stopped in for lunch no greeter so we werent sure where to go super expensive for the portions my salad had dressing only in the center the rest was dry my sweet potato fries that came with breaded shrimp tasted bbqish  weird but the worst was that my breaded shrimp actually had a curly hair cooked into the bread ing it was disgusting the waitress apologized and offered to replace but my appetitive was gone by then she however did not offer to comp the meal i would absolutely not return nor recommend it to anyone way too overpriced and the hair was a disgusting unwanted bonus |not good i suspect the servers are over worked or spread too thin bc the service sucked the food was ok but nothing special its a shame bc better service would have made the experience decent|never been before and went on a thursday night at pm before a show upon arriving all the good seating near the windows was blocked off for private use and remained unused the host told us to go find our own seating wherever we wanted the setup is interesting with a large open bar area and a small number of tables around the perimeter we took a seat at a table the bar seating was fairly full with some milling around in the area and standing and probably a total of  people there we saw at least  staff a couple sitting around playing on their phoneswe sat at our table for  minutes and never had a single person come by not to say we will be there shortly not to take a drink order nothing we could tell this wasnt going to be good so left and no one even noticedit was a little more bar than restaurant so we werent sad to leave|i never ate here nor could have possibly gotten a drink no one would wait on memy friend who wanted to be a socialite of some kind asked me to come with her i dont know what she was thinking not my scene whatsoever we had come from a free devo concert i was dressed in converses  a side pony tale and bright pink s garb i have never seen so many idiots occupying one space the chicks looked at me like i was an alien not everyone needs to wear  inch heels gobs of makeup and clothes that is so tight that your breathing is impaired just to get a little cleavage popping out of a minuscule ugly dress i like fashion i love heals it was the glassy vapid duplicates that i saw that made me give my friends a hug and kiss then seriously bolt out the door super bad energy in this place i jumped in the first cab i saw and headed to lawrenceville i didnt even say goodbye to the friend who had brought me there smoke bomb disappeared she knew i would hate it but just didnt want to go alone i was pissedthe night was not lost my awesome fiends from la stunt man curtze and elvis impersonator slash gangster screen writer met me out and we dive bared the rest of the evening away i meant to write friends but didnt change it because fiends haha much more appropriate i am not saying that people who like this place are any particular sort some of my favorite people like bossa nova just stating my personal experience|extremely disappointed    my wife and i walked into the restaurant to have the hostess tell us that is was open seating   okay thats fine as we walk to find our table im wondering why dont the just have a sign there because she wasnt  very friendly nor timely with the direction    that said we sat down at a table set up for dining that was nicely presented   unfortunately we sat at the table for approximately five minutes without recognition from any employee at the restaurant   at this point we decided to dine elsewhere   as we walked out there was still not one bit of attention given again   the hostess never lifted her head from whatever she was reading   i think that a sign would have served a much better purpose   on the back side it could have said thanks for your business or lack there of|the menu was small and underwhelming the flatbread pizza most likely came out of the box they didnt have the sauces so the gave us ketchup to go with over cooked shrimpbacon and extremely greasy fries|terrible slow servicewaited one hour for oil change wont come again to this place|we were in pittsburgh for one night and olive or twist was near our hotel  there were many other restaurants but this place looked nice  the atmosphere was nice and if i was rating only for atmosphere id give it  stars  however im mainly rating their food and service  we were greeted promptly but after that the service was spotty and it took awhile to receive our drinksfood even though there werent many people in the dining room  i ordered the traditional french dip sandwich and fries  i enjoy a good french dip and have tried many of them at all types of restaurants and this one was the worst ive ever eaten in fact i couldnt finish it  the meat tasted like old lunch meat and the bread was nothing more than a cheap glorified hot dog roll that was soggy  it wasnt soggy from the au jus but it tasted like they steamed the roll for some reason  overall if i was going back to pittsburgh in this area i would stay far away from olive or twist|ive actually had ok experiences at this place in the past but this trip was especially bad i tried to stop here with my husband for an appetizer and a drink before heading into the theater district  bad move  upon being seated the server explained that they were no longer serving food because of a water leak or something unsanitarysounding klassy for reasons i truly cant explain we decided to stay for a beer before heading to our destination we both threw down a brew nasty paid and left unfortunately for olive or twist the visit would probably be our laston a positive note there was an interesting man setting up for what looked like a live acoustic set his warmup sounded good but we left before he really got started when its all said and done we should have just went to the sharp edge down the street probably a much safer bet for future endeavors|owner or manager was very rude when we presented our yelp deal|this bar is cramped overpriced and the service is unbelievably slow happy hour runs  so youll show up at  have no place to sit or stand and will only be able to get maybe  drinks during happy hours youll then be told that the upstairs which is actually not bad will be opening at  even though youre asking at  this has seriously happened all three times ive been thereseriously avoid this place when one of your coworkers suggests a work happy hour direct them anywhere else|very disappointed  i had been to olive or twist for drinks and really enjoyed it but had never been there for a meal  i was going to a show at the benedum with a friend and made reservations about a week and a half before the show  we arrived about  minutes early for our  reservation expecting we may not be able to be seated yet  the problem is that even though i called and made a reservation including the person answering the phone taking my name and phone number and repeating the date and time we were told there was no reservation for our name  the hostess said something along the lines of are you sure you called here to make a reservation and not somewhere else  yes im pretty sure i called the right restaurant  she kept looking at the room of empty tables looking at the book and then looking at us  after a few minutes of back and forth she told us the lounge upstairs was open and we were welcome to grab a table up there  so we trudged upstairs  all that was available were small high top tables  being a friday night it was packed with the happy hour crowd and was pretty noisy  not really the environment we were looking for but we decided to make the most of itwe started with the buffalo chicken dip appetizer  it is served in a martini glass with toastedfried pita chips  it was tasty and we were surprised at how much dip there actually was  the problems with food began with the pacing of the meal  we had our appetizer for under five minutes when our entrees came out  it may not have been a big deal if we were at a real table in the restaurant downstairs but being at the high top bar tables we had no room for our drinks appetizer and meal  we found ourselves stacking stuff and pulling things off the table in order to fit everything  it was frustrating  not to mention that we would either have to let our entrees get cold as we finished the appetizer or let the appetizer get cold as we ate our entrees  with as much as we enjoyed the appetizer we were looking forward to our meals unfortunately they were very disappointing  my friend ordered the french dip sandwich with a side of mashed potatoes  her potatoes were ice cold and sandwich luke warm  when she mentioned it to the server the server said so would you like me to take them back or are they ok  when would cold mashed potatoes ever be ok  when her potatoes were brought back warmed she was disappointed because they were called garlic mashed but she said they were pretty bland with not much garlic at alli ordered the caribbean jerk chicken  it was described as grilled chicken seasoned with jerk spices pepper jack cheese garlic mayo and pineapple chutney on a kaiser roll  no mention of a tomato  when i got the sandwich there were three tomatoes on it   thankfully i just dislike tomatoes and it wasnt an allergy issue  there was also no pineapple chutney  when i asked about it the server told me they use a sauce and it must have been soaked into the rolloverall very disappointed  i wanted to love olive or twist because i really enjoyed the time i had visited for a drink but the dining experience was sorely lacking especially for a dinner that was supposed to be a nice laid back start to our girls night out|at the request of a friend we had a brief girls night out at olive or twist my first impression was the outdated decor the restaurant has carpet which i find off putting the drink menu is extensive but with the exception of one person in my party we each found our drinks far too sweet i ordered the cucumber basil martini which was so sweet i had to send it back the food was mediocre i ordered the burger medium and it was over cooked to nearly well done and then there was the cheesy lounge singer who sang a mishmosh of singer songwriter tunes from the s the music was so loud and so bad that my friends i left and headed down the street to butcher and the rye|i stopped in last night for a drink with a group of friends we were in town visiting and i had been wanting to try this place out since we walked past it on the last trip what a disappointment  the server was prompt to greet us and drop off drink menus but then she failed to return to take our order for at least  minutes  it wouldve been different if she had been slammed but the entire time she was standing by the bar just talking to her coworkers  by the time she came to take our order we were ready to leave and we should have the martinis were not good and the servers disposition left much to be desired  when we were ready to leave she made us feel like it was a bother to split our tabs between the five of us  the one positive of the place was that i liked the ambiance but it wasnt enough to make up for everything else being lackluster  what i was hoping to be a great ending to the night turned into a dismal experience that put everyone in a bad mood|not a fan of the service or i should say lack of it literally killed me to leave a tip no one deserves it and i once tipped a server that never even waited on me before she left for the day i overtip everybody and today it was all i could do to leave |if you want a snotty attitude this is the place for you with subpar food with high prices you have found the perfect place for a bad combination upon entering the door at  pm the hostess said to us my daughter and i we can seat you if you promise to leave by pm now take it there is  tables with one table occupied i guess we promised so she seat us at the worse table in the house near the bathroomkitchen and next to the fire extinguisher when we told the waitress this table was not working she threw our menus on the table next to us the food was minimal in size and minimal care of preparation my daughter order a salad with chicken the salad came out first then a plate of chicken came out later for the customer to put on top of salad my salmon was bland and asked for lemon to help the dish out and never received the lemon left half the salmon uneaten  do not patronize this establishment|if you are a female group be prepared to be ignored by the male bartenders  stood patiently to get waited at the bar upstairs a male customer came up and he quickly served he pointed out to the bartender we had been standing there and he just looked at him like so what  guess the men at olive or twist only like men|my husband and i waited until after pm to come here because it was busy for a private event i had my eyes set on the short ribs which is basically roast yes roast enough said not impressed not happy and being we came up from syracuse we obviously will never return  bill and it wasnt good at all|i had mixed feelings coming here on a monday night for dinner after hearing about a really bad experience a friend of mine had not too long ago we had a groupon that my girlfriend had purchased and we had to use it because it was expiring that week the place was a bit crowded nothing outrageous that would make us want to go somewhere else we were actually seated within five minutes with no reservation so far so good right well thats where it ended our waitress was the textbook version of horrible service drinks took forever to be delivered to our table my girlfriends food was cold and she forgot the soup that we had ordered the food itself was decent  i had the pepper crusted salmon and the drink was just meh i really dont feel sorry at all for our waitress all her attitude was horrible and she wasnt really busting her butt waiting on multiple tables let it be known if you plan on taking orders without writing them down you better be able to deliver the acting manager sat down at our table and apologized and took an extra  off our bill i couldnt wait to get out of there and dont have any plans on returning anytime soon|completely agree with deborah decent sandwich on absolutely horrible bread  mealy tomato and brown lettuce too  i know it was only  for a  sub but it was pretty bad  i bought a  intending to take half home for later but i wound up throwing the second half away and i never throw away food  as a italian grocery it seems okay but the attitudes are a little snippy and its a pretty grungylooking place|maybe its nostalgia for the cigar but i thought he looked ridiculous he bragged about a  pepperoni roll theres a reason it cost that because it wasnt very good the sauce was disappointing i wouldnt come here for anything|the italian coldcut sub was a travesty lots of stale bread with skimpy meat portions and no hots or flavor bread better suited for pigeons than people i can find better italian sandwiches back home in baltimore well feed these to our dogs when we get home  you get what you pay for avoid this tourist trap|first time in pittsburgh from chicago  no one seems to know how the public transportation system works what is with the silly system of paying on your way out sometimes it seems like the dumbest idea ever where are the reloadable transit cards why are the conductors so incredibly angry why do i need to request a stop on the tof the public transportation systems ive used this is definitely the most confusing so far even if the website had an easier to understand fare explanationlearn from the cta i have a new appreciation for chicago transit authority|last night marked the second time in a week that i waited  minutes or more for a b in the freezing cold rain   i was  minutes early for the bus i was trying to catch  i can understand a delay during rush hour but this was not  the bus was running every  minutes both times according to the pat schedule when i gave up last night and went into my apartment it was an additional  minutes before the bus went byso lets review i waited a total of  minutes for a bus that was supposed to be coming past every  minutes  for shamefrom now on ill be hoofing it across the east end instead of buying a bus pass  it will be cold but at least ill be moving|dont ever get too comfortable with pat they end up swiping everything out from under your feet and then charging you a crapload for it  i cant believe theyre slashing more routes and charging more  why would i pay you for continual service downgrades  youre not even offering a bus to the airport anymore here soon do you know how many people ride that bus to work ataround the airport  i tell you what whoever runs your company is a dumbass to the th degreeget your shit together  seriously  id rather walk from my work downtown to my home in oakland thats an hour walk and more than a mile while im  months pregnant  than pay you assholes to take me home ps i didnt even want to give it one star|i bought a home over  and half years ago because it was on a bus line one  year after they cut that  route after being there over  years i think the way they operate is beyond poor and every year there is a far increase now i have to drive to a park in ride you never know what you going to intale every day on teh bus ive been taking for about  years now and i think ive seen everything to the pee smell to no air to no heat to arguements between drivers and riders if they continue on this path there will be no service to downtown just people who live in the city they crossed out the suburbs it should be the port authority of pittsburgh not allegheny county the only thing is can say is the port authority drivers do a great job putting up with what they got oh and did i mention i cant tell you how many times they have broken down now they have a federal grant for the connectcard about time its only been in new york and dc for years i am sure there will be lots of bugs in this system to|the only pro about port authority is it gets you from point a to point b ive had buses that smell like pee ive had buses where the bus drivers are yelling at drivers or people downtown screaming insults out the window  had a bus driver doing like mph down mcknight road at least twice a week i get a bus thats farebox is broke  yeah a free ride is nice but port authority is always crying wanting to increase their already ridiculous fare prices routes are always getting cut which leaves buses jam packed they introduce the connect card an alternative to cash and passes if i load  onto the card i should be able to get a transfer without entering cash the drivers dont know that and argue about it  feel free to train your employees on an  degree day one buses heat was on full blast not the drivers fault he finally pulled over restarted the bus and it read  degrees before the air workedbuses are late all the time  when going to work i need to leave at least an hour before i should have to to ensure i get to work on time i can go on forever|officials estimated about  people would be in downtown for the th of july  i wish someone had informed the port authority of this  maybe then they would have had more than one bus running every  minutes after the fireworks  every single bus stop in downtown had about  people waiting for the already overcrowded buses  if a bus actually did stop some were so full they just drove by fights would break out over who of the  people would get one of four standing room only spots on the bus|how is it port authority has the money to build a pointless over pass on the east liberty busway but cant update their online system for smart phones to be able to determine where a bus is located at i waited two hours today in the freezing cold to get to work had to call off it was just to cold out|terrible customer experience sunday may th at  pm route  outbound centre and graham stop  people including a senior woman and me were standing at the stop the bus came around  minutes late and didnt stop i chase it and caught it at the next stop on a red light and when i asked the driver why he hadnt stopped he said it was probably us who didnt stand next to the stop he kept on arguing loudly and even yelled and cursed this driver should be taught customer service essential requirements|the port authority runs a convoluted and inconsistent transit network  i hate ubers business model but theres a good reason services like it have found such a hold on pittsburgh the buses stop running regularly between  on weeknights and around midnight on the weekends some buses require you to pay on exiting which is bizarre the timetables on the weekends sometimes feature fortyfiveminute gaps between buses and the t only serves the south hills in general im disappointed as a new resident without a car to have discovered pittsburgh to be such a carcentric city when there are so many ways the port authority could be improved and expanded as i write this im half an hour late to work due to a late x  if you need to be somewhere leave min in advance or risk being as unpunctual as the buses|clearly based on other reviews i should try this during daylight hours we went after a long night out landing there around  ive been to plenty of late night places afterhour bars etc but ive never been as scared as i was at jojos  fights broke out while we were there first a group of guys then their girlfriends then a guy at the next table threw up on the ground some splashing on my leg then we heard police sirens and the fights were escalating  so we bolted maybe this is a rare experience anyway  i wont be heading back anytime soon|first off  im a picky eater so take this with a grain of saltokay im not from pittsburgh  i am not overweight not a hipster not on any of the plethora of drugs i own my own home  probably most of all ive never heard anything about this place before walking in so i had no idea what to expect besides lets get breakfastif you are the opposite of any of these points this place is probably worth a try for youwe had a horrendous wait but i think that was a complete fluke  we had a huge group and there was an event that weekendi dont think anyone with less than  had that long of a wait at allthe waitresses are ornery but not rudejust clear  they arent going to make nice or kiss your rear theyre not there for that  i found this respectable and liked itbut the food  oh godpros  portions are massive all the other reviews will tell you that             prices are reasonable cheap even but i suppose that has something to do with the fact that the first pound or two of your meal is pure potato  seriouslyi think i had at least three idaho russets in chipped form on my plate alone             uhm    nothing was drycons  there was no color anywhere  absolutely everything on every plate i saw in the place was some blend of beige  potatoes egg white pancake sausageafter you tilted the whatevergreasethatwas out of your dish everything was the same color               half my dish was potato               the egg was not overmedium it was stillrunny even the whites  i presume this was because they were slammed and didnt have time to cook what were almost certainly factorychicken eggs             the sausage was not identifiably sausage             i had my entire days required calories in butter alone on the toast             there was seriously nothing remotely healthy on this menu  nothing raw nothing green nothing fresh not even as an ingredient even mcdonalds has a fruit cup ffs  taco bell has better quality food             take one look at the clientele when you walk in  it attracts exactly the kind of people you would picture in a dingy greasyspoon truckstop  if you are not one of those people do not bother this place makes dennys look classy|i rented a car with this location as the drop off point i returned the car to the parking garage as instructed and then went to the front desk i signed all paper work and returned the keys about  days later i received an awful phone call where i was being accused of causeing damage to this vehicle i became very angry i called the location back and was again accused of causing concrete damage to the vehicle i asked the lady if they had viewed the cameras in the parking garage to which she replied we dont own the cameras the lady wanted me to write a report stateing i hadnt run into anything when i asked her what would happen if i didnt waste my time as a customer writing a report she replied well do what we have to do i will never ever use this company again nor recomend them to anyone else worst experience and customer service ever|the food was just ok soggy french fries on a greasy cheese steak pattie  the service was awful noise and not helpful for a newcomer to primantis and pittsburgh|we ate at primanti bros based on the reviews on yelp hoping to get a real taste of pittsburgh what i ordered was a sandwich labeled pittsburgher cheese steak what i got was an inedible slab of overcooked mystery meat cole slaw and mediocre fries on white bread the sandwich was very small but i only ate  of it anyway and i have a pretty big appetite i recently ate a  oz cheeseburger at a local burger jointi was truly shocked that was the worst meat that i have seen since junior high school we would have been much better off at burger king luckily we had a nice lunch at salims to wash the taste of this junk of our mouths|worst sandwich on earthid rather eat a dead whorepleasenever come here|oh primantis you always disappoint how can so much food bear so little taste despite a brilliant premise put all your edibles in the sandwich leave your other hand free for the potables the execution leaves much to be desired these guys can never seem to cook their fries properly they are always greasy on the outside raw and mealy on the inside dont think that just because theyre inside the sandwich doesnt mean you can get away with crappy fries the bread what the heck dudes if youre going to put  lbs of ingredients in the sandwich try to use a bread that doesnt immediately turn into insipid playdoh in your handsi like disgusting junk food as much as anyone see my rave review of the o but i wish the primantis goons would put a little bit more effort into their sandwiches seriously guys  take some pride in your work and make something good for once and check the thermostat on your fryolator already|gross many people told me to go here and i was totally disappointed it was bland the coleslaw was too tangy and only contained cabbage and the meat was scary good thing its super cheap do not get the cheesesteak sandwich if you go even though it says  best seller its awful okay on to service everyone seemed like they hated their job someone at my table asked for no tomatoes and add onions and of course she got tomatoes and no onionsmaybe i ordered the wrong thing and maybe they were all just having a bad day who knows|everyone knows that that if you go to pittsburgh you go to primanti bros my friends and i were in town for a piratesphillies game and the pnc park primanti bros was packed the entire game we visited the market square location and if you eat on the patio its a fun place to hang out and drink some iron city beers  i got the black angus sandwich it was quite large cut in half and brought on a piece of wax paper as it turned out im pretty sure the wax paper would have tasted better it was really really not good i did eat the first half but the bread was so tasteless i thought maybe it would be better if i ate the other half piece by piece the coleslaw was ok but the french fries were awful and the little bit of actual meat had little taste we had little to no contact with employees but a cab driver told us about a young couple who dared to ask for a sandwich at another primanti bros without coleslaw and were treated really rudely because you know people being rude is hilarious so i guess if you want an authentic pittsburgh experience then go here but if you want actual decent food avoid at all costs|my family always wanted to try primanti what a huge disappointment at the anchor drive one the pizza was served with a mound of burnt ashes on the bottom not a little but teaspoons of it all over the ovens are not cleaned i ordered the fish sandwich which came out cold a soppy mess from the oil on the bread and a chunk of coleslaw core inedible my sons was no better the waitress saw we had taken only one bite and asked if we wanted to take home we both said no way she didnt flinch and didnt care i dont care to ever go back and will tell friends to avoid in philly theyd be out of business in a heartbeat it is also a dirty noisy unkempt premises|after sitting there and being ignored for  minutes we just left|clearly should have read a few reviews before going here whenever i go to these types of iconic regional dining establishments i order the house specialty to best judge the place on its supposed merits since it was  in the morning i chose not to order primantis  best seller which the waitress told me was beer but perhaps that would have made my experience better as it was i ordered the  best seller the cheese steak it was heinous think a grimy mechanically separated salisburystyle steak with a meager slice of provolone on sliced italian bread served signature primantistyle with coleslaw tomatoes and friesfirst the steak was disgusting terrible flavor smelled and tasted like hippie armpit which im not necessarily opposed to as long as its not involved in something im trying to eat with a gross processed meat texture secondly the fries easily overwhelmed the sandwich with their old fryer grease taste additionally the sandwich was unwieldy and threatening to fall apart at every turna trait i dont hold against decenttasting sandwiches but this lack of structural integrity just added insult to injury my dining partners were equally disgusted by their choices corned beef and ham  cheese sandwiches respectively easily the best part of the meal was the smallman street fries and those were equally lackluster the bacon was simply bacon bits oh the humanity the chili was uninspired and the cheese sauce and sour cream did little but soggy the fries did i mention they tasted like old fryer grease  i will never go back and i will immediately disregard the culinary opinions of anyone who thinks primanti bros produces decent food|wildly overrated  i compare it to pats and genos in philly good when your drunk but only when your drunki went to pitt for  years and i have to say i never understood the primantis hype  i dont know how you get famous for putting fries on a sandwich when the fries suck  they are soggy and tasteless maybe the worst ive ever had  i will say the coleslaw is pretty good and im not usually a coleslaw guy but it doesnt make up for all the other shortcomings  half the sandwich falls out while your eating  the cheesesteak might be the most tasteless sandwich ever  you have to use a whole bottle of hot sauce just to get a little flavor  primantis sucksgo to fatheads on the southside or uncle sams in oakland|really bad service make sure to get in the face of the wait staff or count on being ignored|ate at the one in north versailles floor filty all young kids running the place poor service poorly made sandwich very bad overall the should have a manager on duty i wont be back thanks|previous reviews have said it well lackluster tasteless foodate at primanti bros with a group of friends while in pittsburgh we heard about it from man vs food and were assured that it is a pittsburgh institution the sandwiches are large and the pricing is fine  but what you get is a sloppy sandwich with food servicegrade meat topped with lukewarm fries good in theory bland in execution its a lot of calories without the accompanying flavorwe also had terrible service at the market square location ill chalk this up to a fluke the patio seating at the market square location is wonderful on a sunny day but it started to rain and they actually retracted the awning explaining that it wasnt designed to get wet but apparently their customers arethe legacy and infamy might tempt you to eat here but take your money elsewhere and buy goodtasting food instead of kitsch|there was basically no cheese on my cheese combo sandwich the fries were gross and the waitress was nasty to us|so this is a pittsburgh instiitution  am so underwhelmed  after waiting more than  minutes for our sandwiches in the end these are still just sandwiches they came out cold  and im not just talking about the meat lettuce tomatoes  everything was cold including the fries  what a disappointment  head to dibellas  much better service subs and sandwiches|well it finally happened i had to give a place a single star and it kills me that the place i gave it to had to be primantis im an awful pittsburgheri dont give low ratings easily or often so believe me this place pushed all of my buttons to earn this awful review in fact the single star was only earned because the place is cleaner and more comfy than some of the other primanti places ive been too it kind of has an old diner feeling to it and i liked that alas thats all i likedso why such a low score wellthe service was terrible after spending twenty minutes sitting without anyone coming to refill my water or ask for my actual order  note the place was almost completely empty  i went to the register to ask for something to eat which id started to think i had to do after watching a couple people do the same in hindsight i probably misinterpreted their actions but my mistake does not excuse what happened next my waiter looked at me and went dont you get the concept of a restaurant havent you been to any restaurants like ever sit back down and ill take your order and not even in a joking manner that made me feel like i could smile about my mistake  this guy was being a condescending rude arrogant person it was unbelievable utterly totally unbelievable if i hadnt met company there that night i would have walked out right thento make matters worse this was not a good night to order anything at primantis the coleslaw was way too sweet and there was far too much of it the fries were bland and had no texture at all and there was barely any meat on my sandwich at all the result a big pile of carbs that really didnt taste great after the first few bites rather than a delicious sandwichbefore you all kill me please note i liked my meal at mt lebanons primanti location they also have a more diverse menu which is always a bonus for me  i like having more options i think in the future i will stick to that location in this local chain where even on a busy night i managed to get food in a decent amount of time i certainly will not be coming to the downtown location if i spot my previous downright awful waiter working there again|i cant for the life of me figure out why all the hype i was warned by others that this is mainly where tourists eat but im a tourist here and wanted to try itit was a sandwich mostly of slaw and fries  the thick white bread was dry and boring too crusty the fries on the sandwich overpowered the taste so i dismantled it when the rude server asked how i liked it i was honest he gave me big time attitude and commented that i took it apart i told him i took it apart because it was a horrible sandwich the pastrami by the way and that sir is why you got a  tip never give a zero tip theyll think you forgot always leave just a small amount of changeif you have to put all that hot sauce on the sandwich to make it palatable why bother  the server as he walked away told me its really good with hot sauce which was just tabasco which i dont like any waythey left off the tomato that supposedly comes with each sandwichof the  staff members i came in contact with all but  were rude unfriendly and uncaring one constantly walked by trash that had blown off outdoor tables without picking it upthe fries were good nope wont be back|ive heard all the hype and wanted to try it  tonight was my second attempt here   first time new girl on the grill apologized to me at  minutes at  i walked  not even an acknowledgement from the wait staff   tonight the waiter seemed mad that i didnt know what i wanted to order  after i explained that id never been there he brought me a menu and then proceeded to ignore me for  minutes  i walked again  no more tries here  maybe im doing something wrong  haha|i was really looking forward to a huge tasty sandwich but was greatly disappointed everything was bland nothing had seasoning not even basic salt soggy fries tasteless meat average coleslaw on white bread trying to double for italian bread save your time money and calories and go to wendys instead|super slow service they have inside and outside seating which is nice however they only have two waitresses outside for about  tables they dont take your entire order they only take your drink order and then your good order it took  minutes to get our drink order after finally getting our drinks she waited another ten minutes to come get our food when we ordered our food when i asked for light coleslaw she said they cant do that and for me to just take it off she explained that they just put fistfuls on it so why cant they just put less fistfuls on it our waitress was very rude and didnt make me feel welcomed at all she never introduced herself and just treated us like animals i would never tell anybody to go to the primanti brothers again downtown the one in oakland is so much nicer and better quality its really bad management to have only two people serving outside when there are over  tables its not fair for the customers or for the servers while the food was good as always it wasnt worth the wait because it just took to long the service wasnt nice at all and i wouldnt tell anybody to come here when its crowded|i had lived outside of pittsburgh for a couple of years and have eaten at this primanti brothers location four or five times their sandwiches were always tasty worth the wait and the trouble of finding parking etc so when my parents came to visit and we made a trip out thataway i knew that would be a lunch stop we ended up coming into pittsburgh on sunday around pm i knew it would be crowded and anticipated having a wait we got a table after  to  minutes and quickly sat down before someone else did it took the waitress about  minutes to come and clear the previous customers remnants which was ok we ordered our beers and were told that shed come back and take our order she came back  minutes later with the beers and took our order after that we sat around and waited for our sandwiches for  minutes when we did finally get our food it was ice cold the fries in the sandwich were completely soggy and cold and the meat was barely warm our table ran out of napkins and we asked for some but they never came finally the table next to ours handed us a few maybe it was because it was cold but the sandwiches werent that great i had very little meat in mine and more coleslaw that anything else also the thickness of the bread seems to have increased since i last ate here because about  of my sandwich was bread we were fairly disgruntled about the whole thing but were still going to leave a tip for the waitress then my dad went to the bar to pay he stood there for  minutes behind another customer the server came up to them and said what the hell are you doing up here in those words my dad was so stunned be just stood there the guy in line ahead of him told her that he was waiting to pay his bill so she cashed him out and then turned around to do something else when my dad said excuse me i need to pay too she replied to him  jeez you guys are so demanding why the hell are you in such a hurry that is when their tip went straight out the door with us we were ok waiting for a table we were even ok waiting for our food it took them one hour from the time we sat down to the time we got our food and then the server had the audacity to behave in that manner either primanti brothers has become too big for their boots and let things slide or they need to train their staff to be more polite and efficient we will definitely not be coming back the next time we are in town our money is better spent else where|worst service ever  the waitress and i use that term loosely rolled her eyes at any question when ordering and yelled at someone at the table for asking for coleslaw on the side  then she had to come back and re ask the orders again and got mad when we repeated about the coleslaw since she didnt repeat it back  when she brought out the food she just slammed the food down and just shouted out the name of one of the sandwiches um are you asking who had which sandwich which is your job to remember anyways  im glad i dont live in pittsburgh to have to worry about avoiding this place|can i give this place zero stars theyre supposively famous for their sandwiches so some friends and i go when we are in town the waitresses all rolled their eyes and glared at me for not wanting my fries on top of my sandwich not to mention the waitress was in the skimpiest tank top with her bra hanging out while waiting on us and grilling food gross i get that your famous for having fries on the sandwich but regardless a customer should be able to get what they want this place was trashy dirty and probably not even up to code|this is the most overrated place bragged about in pittsburgh my first visit was to the one in south hills waited  mins for  sandwiches the coleslaw is gross and im a fan of coleslaw due to the  min wait i was given a gift card which i used at the one in market square this time i got the grilled chicken salad if you like chewing on rubber bands i recommend it it was the absolute worst salad ive ever had how can you screw up a salad the chicken was tasteless and rubbery got it to go and the girl who took the order over the phone was rude and rushed and was equally rude when i picked it up she assumed she knew my name and my order and handed me a random bag of food i told her i was missing a sandwich and she tossed another bag at me without saying a word i will never go back to any of these locations id rather eat a ham sandwich from sheetz at least i can get that without an attitude if you have friends coming to visit from out of town take them anywhere but here and for those who say you have to go to the original one in the strip no thanks its the same food if you are looking for an awesome sandwich go to schmitz old world deli in greenfield|service sucked big time on monday june  at the primantis in market square it took more than a half hour for my wife to get a cheese steak and the place wasnt even crowded missed the first inning of the pirates game as a result boo|great food overall at all locations go to another location to eat though the market square location has the most horrible service ive ever experienced horrible|absolutely horrible frozen meat patty with a dog food like taste and texture on the pburgher seriously how does this place survive read sarah f review as it mirrored or experience at the strip district location will never return to any location|service was bad server walked away before we were done ordering and then when someone got her attention she had to return  minutes later to re clarify which it was wrong we didnt see her for a good  minutes and had to go up to the bar for refills she did take one of our cups to refill it sat it on the bar and left it there for  minutes when we finally saw her again had to ask her to grab it off the bar highly disappointing philly cheesesteak the meat in it is that of a frozen salisbury steak tv dinner french fries were good|first yelp review ever not impressed at all  bread  cole slaw  fries and  meat the bread is cold and not grilled or warmed on the grill avoid and eat else where dont even think about the wings dry and no flavor|had lunch here while visiting friends in the area  after seeing all the hype about this place on various tv food shows i was very excited to eat hear  wow  what a dissapointment  this place is so over hyped it isnt funny  to compare this place to the famous sandwich places is nyc is a joke  the sandwiches may be big  but only because they are over stuffed with fries and cole slaw  to steal a line from a old tv commercial  weres the beef   a major major dissapointment |place sucks loser rude servers ignore you even if you stand at a register and wait you will get ignored this place is going down server saidyou dont matter  i have a million people to take care of  this was after waiting  minutes at the register with cash in hand i understand its busy but acknowledge people  appreciate customers when you tell us to f off you ar going down rude not worth it|very bad foods no flavor very dried and underseasoned very bad service they were rude they had open each sandwich break them into half look into it to know what it is and start calling the name of the sandwich out at the table  i do not recommend this place i should have gone to subway|the only thing this place has going for it is the local hype the sandwiches lack flavor its just another one of those places you have to try once to say you did|many pittsburgh locals suggested i give this place a shot when i took a business trip here if this place is considered good to the locals then i feel sorry for the people of pittsburghi ordered the pittsburgher cheese steak and the kolbassi  cheese for both sandwiches the bread used was extremely bland and borderline stale  the bread would crumble with each attempted bite eventually leading to me abandoning them  the fries were so dry and stale tasting as well that i thought it better to just throw them out the veggies were about average not fresh but didnt taste gross  all that was left were the cheese and the meats they may have been the most disappointing because i thought that i could maybe at least enjoy that essentially the entire sandwich was inedible and i settled for five guys instead|the sandwiches seem like a neat idea because theyre stuffed with fries and coleslaw  but thats about all you taste when you eat their sandwiches  in reality theres very little meat lots of bread lots of fries and as a result their sandwiches are very dry and flavorless add lots of ketchup to help the chewing process|saw this place featured on the travel channel and was looking forwarded to trying it  got here and the place had limited customers and were not busy service was poor and they were out of a variety of items  i had the pastrami cheese sandwich and it was good but overall this place is overrated very disappointed considering the reviews from the travel channelnever coming back|being from la i was disappointed with the tacos the carne asada was bland and didnt think this is authentic mexican food but another street faire|this review is for the taco stand in front of reynas which is run by the same owner as reynas and casa reyna note that this is not the same stand as the one around the corner on st street across the alley from pamelasi got an order of three tacos from them on a cold day a couple weekends ago the meat was cold before i could start eating it and i assumed it had just cooled off quickly within a few hours everything i had eaten was leaving me in a hurry i felt sick and weak for the rest of the day and was better and completely empty the next morningnever going back of course this doesnt directly reflect on casa reynas inside restaurant but since the same people run it it makes me worry about their food handling standardsill probably keep getting reynas big bag of chips when i need them for a party but im never eating any other prepared food from them again|i was so excited to make it to reyna their selection is great however when i brought home and opened one of the spices it had flies in it another jar of pepper paste was one year expired and a bag of chilli sauce was expired since  completely unacceptable and disgusting to sell such expired food to your customers check the expiration dates on all purchase from here|omg what a nightmare i was there last saturday at pm with a group of  people in the second floor bar area the bartenders acted like it was a big inconvience that we were there ordered drinks and didnt even get a thank you the bar was dirty and littered with dirty glasses the restrooms were filthy and didnt even have toliet paper  we left the bar and spent a huge anoun of money up the street i will never go back|another place that i visit once every few years thinking it couldnt be as bad as i remember it  and the place never lets me down its just as bad as i remember  the seafood is breaded and fried to the point of inedible  the staff is rude  the prices are too high for the quality  just all around disappointing|i hesitate to even write this review because technically we didnt eat here  but after reading the other reviews i thought eh what the hellwe came in and were seated at pm for dessertsdrinks   by  we still hadnt seen our waitress  we decided it wasnt worth it and just lefti did eat here a month ago and yes  the fried fish was fried to the point where it was beyond greasy  and then to pay around  for that  lol  righti wont be back|went to this place for lunch last saturday party of five the service was extremely slow and every beer we tried to order got the response we are out of that one finally when we got our sandwiches after a long wait but no coleslaw and fries were soggy and stale when asked the waitress for coleslaw which is supposed to be the side with every sandwich the response was i think we are out but let me check and the waitress didnt return until after we were done eating forget about getting a refill for your drink or water|never again horrible service and horrible food it took  minutes for our waitress to even come to our table looking back on it i dont know why we didnt leave maybe because we had to wait  minutes to even get a table this was during the summer we ordered the muscles to start off which were okay but definitely not something i would recommend my husband ordered the fish and chips and i ordered the crab cakes epic fail the crab cakes were so disgusting my husband and i had to switch meals the crab cakes taste like fried mayo i couldnt even taste the crab the fish and chips looked great but it didnt taste like anything no seasoning at all the waitress was so bad that when it came time to give us our check she was no where to be found it took  minutes to actually get the check keep in mind we already finished eating thank god we had cash a complete waste of  yes i remember exactly how much i spent even though it was months ago because i kept thinking how i could have spent that money in a better place i could have got a mani  pedi had some great sushi the list goes on lol|my husband and i went tonight for dinner  bad mistake  worst meal weve ever had  the salad actually tasted like it had a moth ball in it  the sword fish we ordered seemed more like a piece of fatty beef that could not be cut with a knife  the fried calamary was absolutely terrible it was as if someone took a handfull of dough and fried it in clumbs and hid some meat in it  the best part of it was that i got a refund on a soup that i didnt even recieve  i dont recommend unless your drinking and dont care how your food taste  busy slow and awful|we had a frustrating and disappointing experience at rolands a dining out experience on a recent day visit to pittsburghfirst all of the food was extremely overpriced the quality was what you would find if you were ordering from a barbut it was twice as expensive the  i paid for fried cod got me two soggy cod filets steamed bland vegetables and boring roasted potatoes i couldnt have tried to make food this poor it was a sysco food operation gone wrong runoff from houlihans mixed with joes crab shack the service was so slow that we were cancelling orders due to the delay in bringing them to the table my dish arrived without any sort of sauce and we even had to get up and order beer from the bar because our waitress was so behind it was her second day on the job but this is unacceptable they could have at least compd our beers or offered some other way to make it up besides coming over to informing us that they had charged the beers to our billrolands had space available on a monday night unlike the other restaurants in the neighborhood this was really convenient initially but i now have an idea of why this was the case|i would give this restaurant  stars if i could  the food was lousy the drinks were expensive and the service was awfuli complained to the manager about my experience and he told that if i didnt like it there were plenty of other bars in the strip districtplease please please go somewhere else|yuckits almost embarrassing having this place exist in the strip with so many tourists coming here  that has to be how theyre making their money because its certainly not on their food or service  well maybe its the booze tooi dont even know where to begin  service was horrible  the lunch took  hours  on a leisurely sunday that may be fine but there was no leisure  at least not with drinks not in hand until a  an hour after we sat down  id say lunch was served another  to  minutes later  it didnt matter though i knew it wasnt going to be anything spectacular  id heard rumors about the food  i wont go into any details but i wouldnt trust some items on the menu  i just played it safe and ordered a veggie salad  the salad was in the entree section so i assumed it would be a full size salad  it was not  it was a side salad with a handful of grilled veggies on top  nothing spectacular  and a side salad at almost   not worth it  if you are forced to stop in because youre dying of hunger stick to a liquid diet|just awful my companions each ordered an alfredo pasta and they both honestly thought through the entire meal that rolands had served mashed potatoes on the pastawe thought maybe its a burgh thingnope we were informed at the end of the meal by the waiter that it was indeed alfredo sauce and that the chef just liked to use a lot of parmesan cheese in his alfredo this stuff was about the consistently of cold oatmeal with oil poured over it no exaggeration and there was a bucket full of it on each plateanybody who would serve what was on those plates has no business whatsoever in any kitchen by the way my lobster roll was a buttery greasy fail as wellwhat a complete disaster|this place reeks of fish when you walk in and there are fruit flies everywhere  good place to dine if youre on a diet since you will surely lose your appetiteif you find yourself at rolands do yourself a favor and leave and dine anywhere else in the strip district  seriously|if i had to chose between dining at rolands again or having to catch running chainsaws that were tossed at me id pick dining at rolands but only by the slimmest of marginswhy on earth did i go back to this restaurant  clearly i must not love myself or somethingwant to pay too much money for fish that smells like a sewer  dine at rolands  the only reason to be at rolands is to drink there  they have a pretty decent beer selection|rolands was recommended by hotel service was terrible food was cold brick oven pizza cold asked to have it reheated  still came back cold steak was way over cooked never got appetizer we ordered but was charged for it  was not busy but waitress was hard  to find would not go back and would not recommend this place to anyone|friends warned me not to eat here turns out they were good friends this was just awful start to finish slow pitiful service nasty food  and we each sprung for the lobster roll  if you can call it that and a generally miserable experience and this was an early lunch with very few customers around the only thing remotely redeemable was that we sat on the balcony overlooking penn avenue and were entertained by the people below people watching can be a blast i wanted a draft beer and was told that we dont serve draft beer upstairs what theres a bar there are you kidding me so water it was and that took a long time to arrive and without straws  another wait after i had the audacity to ask for them  the lobster rolls arrived and looked mighty meager thats not a lobster roll but i pressed on as i got it closer to my mouth there was a slight aroma but press on the lobster was sparse tough and flavorless how often could you say that about lobster exactly it must have been harvested years ago and waited for me to show up so it could make its way out of the freezer at  each this falls clearly into the ripoff category  and trying to get our check ridiculous i wont be back ever|so four of us came in for the first timediner   ordered the lobster roll sandwich  lobster on a roll nothing morethats it  nothing special  have no idea why people would rave about this  a bland poor excuse of a sandwich that does a disservice to all northeasterners who know what a lobster roll is and this aint it  is this lobster  read ondiner   ordered a large raw bar sampler which was six quahog clams six oysters and six rubbery shrimp  who serves tough chewy quahogs on a raw bar  this dive  also ordered the mussels which were not seasoned and swimming in water  no winegarlic sauce as advertised on the menu  water    bland and awful  finished with the mediterranean pizza which is spinach feta and olives  the better part of the dinnerdiner   steamed clams  again who serves quahogs for steamed clams  these amateurs  also had the clam chowder  which appropriately had minced quahogs in it diner   ordered the salad with the lobster roll hold the bread  also asked for the lobster to be served chilled with it  lobster came hot and was dyed a deep red color  why the need to put lobster in a dye   becauseits not maine lobster  imposter fish is dyed and artificially flavored then frozen then thawed then microwaved at rolands and called lobster  thats my guesssent the mussels back  no offer to reduce the check or offer a comped dessert   rest rooms are dirty and smell of urine  mens was an awful smelling pit and i was told that the ladies had one toilet drenched with urine on the seat another blocked up and overflowing and a third that could be usedthis place is a smelly dingy dive bar with horrible food and poor service  it is a trap for the unsuspecting tourist you have been warnedstay away|if  stars were possible id give em got back from here yesterday evening and i am physically ill i didnt even touch the anemic yellow and fishy smelling muscles  not that the waiter asked why we hadnt eaten them more on this character in a moment my ahi tuna steak was decent but i think the scallops are what got me and my friend is sick as well just saying  check your food before the waiter walks offspeaking of the waiter  one of the worst ive ever had the displeasure of umm being served by that sounds awkward and vaguely jackassy  hmm the mild poisoning i have is affecting my wit but you follow methis guy spilled half the water out of the oysters while trying to put a plate down and didnt notice or say anything about it when he did he asked me how i wanted my tuna steak prepared worst of all he spoke in this low monotone while other customers and cars going by drown him out so all you can tell is he asked you something because hes standing there with this kind of come on look on his face  totally rude and completely inept i was hard put to give  tip to be honest id suggest the similar bar down the road for better quality food and service good luck out there|ive tried and tried to give this place a chance  its upsets me that an establishment like this can exist among so many great places in the strip  i end up at rolands because my boyfriends coworkers always want to go there for happy hour  they have a special on oysters and shrimp cocktail so i ordered those  the oysters were absolutely disgusting  they were not fresh or cleaned very well  my fingers ended up getting all dirty and they had a gross gritty taste to them  they threw the poorly deveined shrimp on ice and it ended up soggy  i had to pick the veins out myself and after about two i lost my appetite  as always the service was terrible  next time im dragged to a happy hour there ill order water  never again will i spend money in this place  yuck|we wanted to eat there today waited for about  minutes at the entrance no hostess coming up then she shows up saying that she will be back in another second after additional  minutes we ask her whats going on she did not apologize and says that it will take another  minutes really not the nice way to treat a party of  wanting to spend some money|last weekend my mother and i headed down to the strip to get some weekly goods  lunch meat and cheese from penn mac  veggies at stans  needed some new spices from penzeys for a chili i was going to make that daywe were both a little hungry and knew we wanted to have a snack before shoppingwe parked in front of rolands and see the sign famous for lobster rolls and bloody marysperfect my mother got the lobster roll which she said was good the bread from mancinis was of course tasty  toasted and buttery  delicious mostly because it was mancinis bread i had the lobster roll minus the carbs on a salad  and the lobster was tasty no doubt  i mean lobster is just  good for the price though not sure that i got enough bang for my buck the salad was something i could have picked up at getgo in the premade section i just didnt feel satisfied at the end of my meal i couldnt even drink my bloody mary this is a rare affair way too much horseradish and i often like horseradish in my bloodiesand it was cold  didnt even take my winter coat off so needless to say not the best experiencetalk about false advertisement|i really wanted to like this place the beer choices and the casual menu was right up my alley unfortunately the food was not the famous lobster roll had so much butter on it i think i am going to have a heart attack in my sleep tonight cant recommend the place|rough experience today  had one drink and left waited  minutes for service and it is not busy when i said something  everyone wanted to blame someone else  waitress couldnt describe beer and didnt iffer to find out or sample it  brought  year old son a pop in a little kids cup waitress did apologize for cup but it was too late  chose to leave|warning  this place is for suckers only  funky smelling worse tasting seafood  overpriced  raunchyunclean restrooms  only reason anyone goes here is because this is a tourist trap  type neighborhood with some fun shopping spots nearby and this restaurant is positioned in the center of everything as pt barnum once said   theres a sucker born every minute   stay away  any other restaurant will be better |stopped in on the fourth of july for evening cocktail and small meal from horrible service to terrible seafoodwould never return we waited a very long time for cocktails and order to be taken when there was little crowd around in the restaurant then our oyster order came out on a plate of water not ice they were small and shriveled up and warm next the mussels in white wine saucehahahah um noit was more like garbage sewer sauce mussels were freezing cold had to search for a server to get the check took a long time again normally i would complain right then and there for such terrible food and service but it was one of those days that was going so nicely that complaining about food would just ruin mine and my husbands infrequent night out without kids i did feel strongly enough to write this review how can a seafood place serve terrible seafood i have never given a  star review and have worked in the food service industry this place is terrible spend your money somewhere else|the wait staff looked like they were bussed in from a homeless shelter the strange hostesses seated my party of   it took  minutes to get our first beers ordered an app  left  minutes later the lobster nachos never came which sucked because i was quote excited about those the place is gross there was food  trash all over the floor  i watched several women exit the restroom with very disgusted looks on there face because the restroom was so nasty this was confirmed by my wife skip this place  go anywhere else in the strip district|super disappointed in this place came here for a paint nite they were hosting and arrived over an hour beforehand to eat all i ordered was soup and salad in order to be quick and my friends who ordered a lobster roll and shrimp got their food within  minutes  minutes later and ten minutes prior to painting i still had not received mine on top of that there was only one bartender working the whole top floor when we told him id have to cancel my order to begin the event he began cursing about the staff at the restaurant it was incredibly awkward when the food arrived it was mediocre at best will not be coming back to this place unless im dragged|i think one star is being highly generous for this restaurant my family and i visited rolands on a sunday afternoon for some lunch it was by far the worst experience at a restaurant i have had my husband and i both ordered the lobster rolls and i order my daughter pasta from the kids menu it took the staff so long to bring our lunch and when it finally came my husband and i both got our sandwiches but my daughter got nothing of course she was not happy about that at all and trying to calm her down we were giving her our food so that she had something but she really wanted her pasta my husband went to talk to the manager and our server came over but still no pasta  minutes later the pasta finally came out and of course it was scalding hot not only was the pasta so hot that it was inedible especially for a kid there was a pool of greasy butter and oil in the bottom of the bowl i think my kid ate more of the grease than the actual pasta it was disgusting this was such an absolutely horribly disappointment of a restaurant not to mention that the lobster roll was not even that great and definitely not worth  maybe it would have been better if it didnt sit on my plate for twenty minutes while i waited for my daughters food dont waste your time here especially if you have kids the staff minus our waitress who was really nice and it wasnt her fault are a bunch of bozos|ugh if i could give this place  stars i would what a nightmare to start the first time i ate here i almost swallowed a giant shard of plastic that was in my salad then to my horror the bar tending goes whoops and tosses it on the floor fast forward a couple months i decide to give this place a second chance i must have been delirious from hungerfirst off the bar tender was rude slow as hell and terrible at making drinks my friend and myself order our food and  min later out comes my friends food after almost an hour of waiting i still had no pizza when i asked the cranky pants bar tender in the nicest possible way where it was he just shrugged and walked away i asked to speak to a manager and was told he was busy finally someone came to talk to me and after an hour and a half i got my shitty pizza thank you to the kitchen manager for doing his job and coming to talk to the customer but to the bar tender working earlier new years eve you do not deserve this job and should be fired|absolutely a waste of time and money service is just terrible wait staff was more focused on sweeping under our table while we were still seated then pre bussing our table the food was terrible and way overpriced i never even had the opportunity to complain about my food because our server never asked im leaving and my table is still covered in all of the dishes and empty beer glasses just awful|the ahi tuna contained sheets of sinewy tough tissue that made it inedible my uneaten tuna sat on my plate in front of me during a group event for more than an hour before the server removed it there werent enough staff so she simply was not able to ask anyone how the food was the restaurant was too busy the mashed potatoes were good|this place is less than mediocre visited on a friday night and it was pretty crowded we requested a high top near the bar and the hostess was very accommodating the food was meh the clam chowder was just ok i was excited for the lobsterartichoke pizza but it was absolutely tasteless like i was shocked by how much it tasted like nothing i ended up slathering my clam chowder all over the pizza in an attempt to kick up the flavor the pizza crust was good thin and chewy just like i prefer we also ordered the lobster roll sliders and the best thing about that dish was the mancini bread  not worth the bucks the service was slowmo but as i mentioned it was a crowded friday night so it didnt bother me much there were a few good beer selections on draftso thats a plus but i definitely wont return life is too short for less than mediocre food|terrible experience here the food was way overpriced and tasted like overcooked slabs of meat we ordered the mussels as an appetizer a swordfish entree and an ahi tuna entree we got our appetizer salads and entrees at the same time and everything was cold i dont know how you can manage to overcook food and then its still cold but thats what happened the mussels were barely seasoned and were hardly edible i never complain at restaurants but our meals were so bad that we had to complain to the manager luckily he appologized and took one of the entrees off i cant believe how bad the food was and that theyre charging so much for it it was awful|lets call this place for what it is its a racist establishment bartenders going around the bar and exiting as if they were on a carnival ridetaking care of everyone else and not once asked what i wantedhailed one of them for a drink didnt even offer a food menuafter three sips i asked for a food menu bartender nearly tosses it across the tablepaid for the lousy  beer and got up the whole time the patron next to me was eyeing the whole situation as if expecting a bigger reaction from measked for the manager and brought it to his attention his response oh i had no idea i apologize|i used to be a frequent visitor of rolandsthe food was always good and the beer was always coldwell not this particular friday afternoon i went there with a friend just after the lunch rushwe sat at the bar because we a little short on time there was only  bartender working so the service was a little slow we ordered  beers and  fish sandwichesthe beer was lukewarmit came out of the tap with so much foam i could tell before he sat it down in front of methen he tried to argue the fact that the beer was warmnot a good start he finally conceded to replace the beer with some that were a little colder but not much and gave a lame explanation to why the temp was not right took our order and then we waited and waited and waited for about mins for our sandwiches to come out i want to say the fish was very hot but it was also very greasy as if they fried it and then refried it then let it sit in the dirty brown greasenot to mention the fries were very cold so after waiting another mins the bartender asked how is the foodof course we complained know we waited  more mins to talk the manager timhe was snarky and sarcasticwhen we told him the fish was greasy he returned with well it is fried in greaseduh tim we kinda knew thatneedless to say we did not finish our beer or our foodwe went down the street to wholeys and got a hot fish sandwich minus the grease|i regretted coming here almost immediately it took  minutes just to get our waters all of our entrees came at different times my friend ordered the seafood stew and the oysters were extremely chewy and nearly inedible i had to spit the oyster out in a napkin this is the first and last time im coming here|on a slow night it takes minutes for water minutes for beer  minutes for soup and raw entreescome hungry leave hungrier and bitter because you wasted time and money|not sure if it was the food but  of us in our party were sick after eating last night  the only thing we ate that was different from the rest of our party was clam chowder|waited to be seated for  minutes no one greeted us asked a passing waitress if we seat ourselves waitress walked up the stairs and shouted out no   minutes later same waitress passed by and again we asked if we could be seated she walked up the stairs and ignored us we asked totalk to the manager and she threw her arms up and said if you can find him needless to say we will not be returning to this place|extremely disapointed we signed our receipt for a total of  later to find out we were charged   i guess our waitress needed the extra   never going back letting our bank handle this one  would love to see the receipt copy we left again|beware duquesnepitt families visiting or anyone else   awful food and service super slow cold fries freezer burned carrots rubbery lobster claws wait ceasar salad was ok  who hunts down the server for  minutes to get the check we couldve just left without paying but i believe in karma no stars|spending a beautiful day in the strip a few weeks ago culminated in a what id hoped was a quick stop at rolands grab a beer lobster roll and salad and id be home before traffic i was not so lucky i arrived and was immediately sat by a waitress that appeared to be extremely overwhelmed by the five tables in the patio there were a few guests at the bar being entertained by the bartender i should have gone and sat there but it was so nice out i decided to eat on the patio my beer order was taken quickly but then took twelve minutes to arrive by that time the head was gone and it was losing its cool the waitress abruptly dropped off the beer and disappeared i already knew what i was ordering but she flitted around from table to table awkwardly for a good ten minutes until i made creepy eye contact with her and she shuffled my way she took my order and pretended to care about what i was ordering but then disappeared again forty minutes later my poor lobster roll arrived the fries were mushy and the lobster roll took six six napkins to sop up all the grease i ate it but i wasnt happy about three bites in and with the fastest response time of my dining experience here comes awkward waitress again asking if i needed anything else i decided on another beer she then proceeded to ask me if i minded if she smoked a cigarette before she grabbed my beer what no forget the beer bring me my check  with no tip for awkward waitress i left probably never to returnhappy eating just not here|i ate dinner here with a group to celebrate a friends birthday  my overall opinion is that the service was terrible and the food was overpriced  our drinks took  minutes to arrive  we were drinking beers so im not sure why it took so long  we had to wait an extremely long time for our food i would estimate at least  minutes  we had ordered calamari and bruschetta for appetizers but they were served with the entrees  when we started to eat it became very obvious that our food had been sitting for a while  anyone who had french fries said they were cold  i ordered the rosemary shrimp scampi which came with mashed potatoes and a broccolicarrot mix  the mashed potatoes were lukewarm at best and the vegetables were cold  i ate the broccoli but i dont like raw carrots so i didnt eat those  it honestly looked like they just threw a handful of baby carrots onto the plate  as for the shrimp itself it tasted good but wasnt what i expected  i was expecting a pastatype dish but it was just  or  pieces of shrimp in a garlic butter bath  and i dont think a few pieces of shrimp and cold vegetables should cost  especially when i was still hungry after the meal  to top it all off we realized halfway into our meals that we were never given napkins  we had to ask twice for them to be brought outthe only good thing about the experience was the beer selection  if i ever come back here i will just stick to the bar and not waste my time or money on the food|terrible tuxedo rentals i went here  months before my good friends wedding to get sized and order my tuxedo the salesman who measured me did not know what he was doing continued to ask someone else if he was doing it right and made me extremely uncomfortable at the moment i wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt that he would get it right when i picked it up it did not fit they go through a third party and did not have an easy way to remedy the situation they had to ship a replacement to where i was going since it was an out of town wedding i had to return it to another jos a bank store because i did not want to go back to the rpm location to see the guy that fit me originally when i returned i wanted to see what they could do for my extreme amount of inconvenience and they hassled me when i wanted a refund i was going to use them for my bridal party tuxedos next year but no way now all the employees there just said they go through a third party so its no wonder their rentals are not easier ha poor excuse for a gentlemans store oh and its very very expensivehowever jack from the rpm store was very kind and helped to make a bad situation better|the owner nicholas g nicholas needs to attend a few driving classes before he kills someone maybe too much hp for him if you see an  white porsche with fl plate  mnc stay clear guy drives like a nut almost ran me off the road in boca raton by |rude thats the first word that comes to mind when my fianc and i came into town i was excited to see what looks like a small interesting coffee shop and that about sums it up it looks that way when you walk in you are hit with delicious aromas of coffee they have lots of interesting treats and teas i was so excited while standing in line then the service first the girl at the register practically threw the man ahead of us back his credit card he didnt make a comment but i thought rude when it was our turn i asked for a cappuccino and questioned what kind of milk they have she responded uh  like i was stupid rude then the guy behind her said anything you want really not so rude and so i asked for a whole milk cappuccino what i received  was a whole milk latte its a coffee shop at least get the drink craft down i cant drink the amount of milk in lattes i didnt order a latte so i walked back apologized for being that person and asked for a whole milk cappuccino less hot so i can drink it right away she said fine rude she made me a  cappuccino scalding hot was it decaf i dont know but i wouldnt put it past her as she handed it to me she said in a condescending tone this should be enough foam for youthe foam was light and airy very pretty but this isnt what i ordered i burnt my tongue and am not a fan of the  rude so very rude all i wanted was caffeine and a good experience i will never come back here|i have been here several times in the last year the food is averagekind of fastfoodlike it sits in the warmer cases and looks crusty the gyros are average not as good as the ones at the south side gyro restaurant by any means  the salads are from a bag of prechopped lettuce and not fresh or interesting but in order to enjoy the average food you have to get past the really rude food wait staff  the bartenders seem to be ok the clientele in the bar seem to be regulars and it is a cheap drink attraction to some downtown locals the staff that serves the food and takes the orders are out of this world rude there is one that wins the prize for insulting the customers and after having endured her i will never ever return owners should know how they are being represented at the front register the man that cooks and plates the food is oblivious or just is used to hearing her speak to people with such a lack of respect that he is just deaf to it go somewhere else it is cheap food and you get what you pay for i would pay twice as much to feel like the staff gave a crap that i was there supporting their jobs|it was very cold inside the restaurant i had the posieden salmon and the filo dough was so tough i couldnt cut it my plastic fork my husbands pork was a small portion it was very inexpensive and i understand why wont go back or recommend it|sucks  i walked across thd bridge in the rain got there before closing but the doors were already locked  why post a closing time if it isnt honored|sorry but i stopped in this morning to get my lunch because i knew i would be too busy to go out for lunch  got a greek salad  first of all there was no lid on the salad it was wrapped in plastic wrap what anybody could put anything in there without too much trouble  second when i went to eat it i threw most of it away because the lettuce was brown andor wilted  not going back again  i didnt spend all that money for garbage|um so i dont think anyone else has experienced this but when i went to order with the woman at the counter she smelled strongly of alcohol and didnt seem very coherent  she didnt know what the specials were and asked me to tell her what they were which i found extremely odd  the whole situation was alarming so i decided to put back the water i was holding and go to the crazy mocha in the same building instead  im not sure what is going on with this place but it seems like they need to change their staff  this was my first time trying brown bag deli too|this was one of the most disgusting restaurants ive ever been in  first decided to sit inside  there were nats flying all over the place  so i decided to sit outside as i had already ordered my food  however there were bugs all over the outside patio as well probably from the standing water with plastic flowers in them  i ordered a hummus and pita which they made me think was free but charged me for a glass of wine and a chicken kabob  the food was decent at best  then i go to check out my dinner was   better yet the cook who was checking me out had the nastiest yellow finger nails i have ever seen  i thought i was going to throw up but i was too motivated to get out of there|i hated it first when i reach there the server showed me a table at the door i asked for another location because it was cold his answer why followed with an arrogant face ok we finally sited in another place the salad came it was ok nothing special the entree please i can cook better the lamb was sooo ordinary since i was in pittsburgh for a meeting i ask to the same old gentleman that was serving us for a itemized ticket  to be reimbursed by university whole sh his answer this is the receipt i can give you nothing else you can write by yourself what you ate and show to them the only restaurant that gave me so rude unprofessional answer ever it is not everything i just took my things and i was moving out when the same gentleman say loud the tip was not include oh my god should i really tell him how much he deserved but i took a deep breath and some bucks from my pocket and give to him saying sorry with my mouth but shov it with my eyes please if you go to there cross the street you find a nice indian cuisine five steps ahead cambodian three steps back a nice cafe better six penn at the corner|okay so this place was a pretty big disappointment  the hummus was extremely watery and barely had any hummus flavor  the pita served with it was definitely store bought  i ordered the lamb kabobs which were greasy on the outside and had spices just slapped on them like they were going to flavor the lamb magically but it ended up tasting like chewy undercooked lamb with a bunch of spice on the outside  they salad served before the meal too was awful  it had wilted iceberg lettuce with one kalamata olive a handful of tomatoes barely any cucumbers and loads of a flavorless dressing  basically just dont go here|this place looked hopeful for authentic mediterranean but the food just didnt live up to any expecation do yourself a favor and go next door to cafe milano|this place was really gross  there was no one around when we went in but we were starvingthe food wasnt fresh the dishes were dirty and i felt like i was going through pans labyrinth to get to the bathroom which was pretty far away seemingly in another dimension  it was almost an adventurethere was old black slimy greens in my salad but at least the watermelon in the salad was good  ill give them that  the olives were even disgustinghow do you mess up olives  the spanokopita was limp and oily and devoid of much phyllo  and there were copious bugs flying around our food the whole time we dined  when we paid the cashier asked how much of a tip we wanted to leave and added it directly to the bill  instead of giving us the opportunity to leave our own tip or write it on the restaurant receipt  the bill was way too highif you really hate someone you should take them to this restaurant|dirty unclean my friend and i went to lunch here  she went to go to the bathroom upon returning to the table had the following story to tell  to get to the bathroom she had to go through the kitchen and down a flight a stairs when passing through the kitchen she saw raw chicken left out in the heat congealing in its own blood  christos you get no second chances after a stunt like that  the food was tasty but come on now chicken chillen on the counter is a no go in anyones kitchen|the food was clearly microwaved ie the ring around the soup bowl and splatters along the sides the fish was rubbery the wait staff although nice was very salesy always trying to add on something in a pushy way i asked for my check and barely ate anything i think the waiter got his ego bruised because he decided to display his best in city award right behind my head as i was still sitting at the table a shame the award was from  i guess a lot changed in  yearsdont bother with this place|christos was one of the worst experiences ive ever had while dining in pittsburgh they call this a greek restaurant but they dont even have a normal gyro on the menu my boyfriend and i decided to split the platter which was horrible the gyro meat wasnt off the spick the dolmades were the worst thing ever eaten in my life and they charged us  to split it which we didnt even ask for in the first place the only pleasant thing about this place was the cook who ended up serving us our food after our waiter went out for what seemed like a drug deal over all everything was bad and i would never return and would advice everyone else to do the same|soi read the reviews on yelp  urban spoonmostly negative but hey i was hungry and gave it a shotits true the place is dingy  like entering a greek grandfathers home i was first asked  if i wanted huumus i declined that after reading is was mediocre at best so i tried the  saganaki it came out in an old brown dish with what looked like rubber floating in lemon juice and oil  the owner failed to mention the pita bread was extrait tasted worse than it looked if that was possible tough cheese mostly tasteless and chewy  i have had many saganaki in various countries this ranked as one of the very worst i made the best decision to leave before food poisoning set in bottom line  horrific |this place is something straight out of a david lynch film it felt like i was transported to some sort of alternate reality with the help of a smiling and overbearing greek man outside a restaurant door preying on the weak and indecisive something in the air of this place comes off as so fundamentally strange and almost discomforting and nightmarelike you are going to feel uneasy is what im trying to say  they overcharged us probably intentionally they dont have itemized receipts  the waiter kept giving us options as if they were free options that youre supposed to choose we caught on when we specifically asked if they cost extra the elusive bathroom felt like we were descending down the staircase to hell better than nothing i suppose the food oh my god none of our food was good in fact most of it was outright grossuneatable the hummus was decent but i can also get decent hummus at trader joes we initially felt bad for these guys a struggling business is always sad to see but with all of the strange behavior attempts to scam us etc that sympathy turned into a sense of understanding as to why this place isnt doing so well if the owners are reading this im sorry if my review came off harsh but really please rethink the way you are going about your business i dont want you to fail i want you to overcome this do it the right way not the scummy way i know youre trying but try differently|warning do not go heremy family was visiting my sister in pittsburgh and we had our eyes set on a specific restaurant not christos a gentleman i presume the owner of christos saw my family and i as we walked down the street he flashed us his menu pitching to us why his restaurant was the best and why his food was the best i could barely tell if he was selling food or used cars i kindly told him we were not interested my family however was indecisive when it came to getting a restaurant we ending up wanting to go eat at the restaurant next door to christos so we backtracked again the owner flashed us his menu sensing our touristy indecision i again declined and pointed to the restaurant i was heading to he then ignored me and panhandled to my two sisters mother and wife they gave in to my dismay as they said sure i looked inside the restaurant of christos at peak dinner hours  no one was inside  absolutely no one as my family walked in and i rolled my eyes i thought well lets give them a chancemy whole family seemed to feel bad for the guy and i like greek foodas we got in it seemed nothing was going on we had just came back from kayaking so we needed to wash our hands they didnt seem to have a restroom but they took my sisters and mother through the kitchen and downstairs to find one the silence was broken when they finally put music on and suddenly a couple of kitchen helpers came out and looked like they were warming some of the kitchen equipment up  were we their only customers tonight i bet we were before i could settle in he casually asked if i liked pita and hummus obviously i said yes he was asking me so casually when i didnt even have a menu i assumed it was complimentary when he said he would get me some but as i waited i found his restaurant on yelp with my phone and the first review gave them one star and mentioned how the owner didnt tell him the pita was extra  great the rest of my family later came back from the restroom akin to going to a restroom at a grocery store where youre around stock itemsexcept you need to go through their kitchen they started with salad the waiter asked if i wanted anchovies or something else on my salad i was going to say sure but my wife stopped me and said it could be extra the waiter looking like he got caught verified he was offering all extras to me even though earlier the owner said salads came with dinner i had to sayi just want the standard salad nothing extra i couldnt let my guard downwe ordered some food priced about what youd expect  the pita and hummus i ordered earlier was just barely average so i dont know why they thought it was worth  my sister ordered leg of lamb so i expected to see a leg of a lamb instead when her plate came out it looked like sad slices of ham really we all got vegetables but they were soggy and unappetizing i saw them earlier in the kitchen sitting in a big pot when i had used the restroom nothing here is fresh my lamb was on the chewy side my sisters leg of lamb was left uneaten and she asked if i wanted some i tried to eat it but it was too chewy they then asked for dessert i wanted to say no out of my discontent but again my family members all said yes even when they were telling me the food was not great  i dont have their sense of pity the desert and salad were the best things of the night which was kind of sad when we got the receipt and my wife insisted we check it  surprise they overcharged us  from two mysterious items their receipt doesnt even list what you ordered i went up the the cashier to ask them what the two items were he tried to explain one but he really couldnt he scratched out the  item i then questioned the  charge again he tried to explain it but he really couldnt again he agreed with me and scratched out the   on top of all this we still gave them a normal tip out of pity i could tell the waiters were just following orders i could tell the owner had trained them what to say and how to make extra moneyyouve been warned theres a reason why this place is doing so poorly  theres a reason why the whole hour between pm and pm we were the only ones in the restaurant theres a reason why the owner is begging customer to come in theyre cutting corners on customer service and food quality in exchange for salesman tactics overcharging and tricking you to buy things you dont even know is extra do not go hereowners like this will saybut i have to or else i wont make it you know what restaurants like yours shouldnt make it not to be harsh but it was a poor experience change your food your sales tactics and your fake receipt items strategy maybe a long time ago when they started they were real but now they are doing every dirty trick in the book to nickel and dime you  warning do not go here|if you like rotting salad rude staff greasy food stupid stories about jackie onassis and her favorite dessert then this is the place for you absolutely terrible i cannot say a single good thing about this place its just tough to figure out how they remain in business|food lacked flavor for every course service was very bad even though only  tables were being served at the time the leg of lamb was flavorless strips of low grade meat maybe lamb waiter will try and hard sell at every interaction throughout the meal|i have no idea why this place is considered a pittsburgh staple restaurant i have been there a few times for corporate events and the service is always lacking and the food is just tasteless terrible and slightly expensive for how processed everything seems its like they buy everything from cans and dont even care enough to spice it up a bit the building itself is pretty and it does have a bar but for promoting itself as a fine italian food restaurant i really their style is missing something|why come to this place when you have a tasty world of italian restaurants right at your hungry fingers in this townthe place is essentially a touristtrap that seeks to reel in folks who are looking for a fun looking italian warehouse nowhow would this be fun apparently it is to somedont get me wrongthe food is not atrocious but it certainly is subpar my chicken parm was quite untasty and seemed as if the spaghetti had come out of a can the service was mediocrekeep driving to bloomfield|didnt think this was possible but its worse than olive gardenfood was horrible and extremely overpriced service was decidedly lacking  neat location with fun and interesting decor but i wouldnt eat there again|we have been coming here since it opened but will not go back after our three last visits it has gone downhill badly three visits ago we were seated in the trolley and then completely ignored for  minutes there was a waitress but apparently she was new and only had the front half i finally went out front and demanded the manager who finally assigned a waitress for us and comped our meals the lasagna was very disappointing with hard noodles and definitely not oven baked and barely warmtwo visits ago to use the gift cards we intended to use on the previous visit service was poor and food was fairthe last visit last night was the third strike and sw is out very poor service and food the drinks were all ice and refills were not timely the server past our table many times but she flew by each time like we were not there the zucchini appetizer was good we only got one loaf of bread which was barely done and came with almost no butter no ranch dressingreally this is the strip district after all with many stores for crying out loud the food was very poor the spaghetti and meatballs had about a tablespoon of sauce the fetticini alfredo was almost devoid of sauce as well my wild mushroom and chicken was not warm but tasted okay we will not be going back olive garden and bravos in the north hills will be getting our business from now on|yesthe food is good and the portions are big  our waiter was very speedy and attentive  that being said i cannot ever go back to this place again because of the amount of bugs i saw in such a short period of time  all gnats and thankfully nothing worse but who knows whats going on in the kitchen  not just a stray gnat or two but dozens just swarmed our table  i killed one with my bare hand on the table and another one bit me and drew a spec of blood disgusting a manager looked like a bus boy if you ask me but what do i know did come to talk to us about it after my waiter noticed me covering my food with my napkin but it didnt accomplish much no free meal or anything  i noticed other people moving to other parts of the restaurant to avoid these bugs too|i never thought that standard italian food was hard to make as i alway say it doesnt take a rocket scientist to boil noodles and open a jar of pasta sauce and grate some cheese for years this place has been touted as a diamon in the ruff in an area of the strip that has since built up greatly over the last  years i had gone in the past but most recently decided to visit again because of their no coupon lunch special advertised in the sunday paper and also in the red plum coupon section it was around  for spaghetti marinara a salad and what they call fresh baked bread let me say the spaghetti came out in a bowl with alot of tomato chunks and what looked like some raw oregano shaken on top the noodles from a box definately not fresh pasta were room temperature along with a quite a bit of water that settled to the bottom of the bowl from the sauce seperating i would honestly rather have had ragu robusto from a jar instead of this particular sauce it tasted like stomach acid was sour and had not texture to it the oregano flavor was overbearing and quite off putting the salad was as described in the review below mine watery iceberg with brown edges and some dressing spooned on top we ended up eating alot of bread since nothing else was appetizing the first one came out warm and the second one was cold and a bit hard i am going to take a wild guess and say that the bread loaves are made off site and come in a plastic bag inside a giant box such as brown and serve rolls you can tell they are placed in some type of convection oven to be heated slightly before they serve it to you its pretty much a crap shoot if you get a warm one or not with the special price tax  tip and depending on if you buy a beverage or not you end up paying about  to  per person anyway not sure if this is your idea of a cheap lunch but at home i can make this meal from about  per person and it is always way better do yourself a favor and go out and buy some fresh pasta at one of the stores in the strip touch up one of your favorite jar sauces with a little italian sausage buy a bag of butter lettuce and some salad dressing from aldi and a fresh loaf of mancinis bread at your local supermarket and have a feast save your money by not frequenting places like this|the food is horrible  how can you serve pasta and marinara sauce and not even toss the pasta in the sauce  i truly received a pile of watery noodles with a ladle of sauce on topactually the name says it all  while this place has an italian food menu there isnt an italian bone in its body  you feel as if you are being served italian food from an irish line cookthe restaurant decor was really nice when they last decorated it in  which was also the last time that they updated the menu|there has to be better italian food in pittsburgh  i dont know why anyone would come herei had an overnight field trip with my students to pittsburgh  the tour company took us here for a murder mystery dinner show  they had us sectioned off which was great for privacy  also since the students were loudtheir service is a hot mess  they only had  waiters serving our  person group  it was not organized at all  just getting our drinks out was confusing  the waiters just came out with any drink  then asked  anyone order this  this is why my table sat drinkless breadless  saladless for the longest timefor our dinner we were given a salad entree  tiramisu  the salad was definitely straight out of the bag  doused with some cheap dressing  it didnt taste fresh at all  there was a list of  or so entrees we could choose from  they came out quite haphazardly  i unfortunately ordered the fettuccine alfredo  worst ever  i could make better alfredo using the sauce from a supermarket jar  i tried to douse it with pepper  cheese but alas it did nothing to help it  some of the others said the chicken parm was alright but some said theirs was undercooked  the tiramisu also was gross  it definitely was made  cut awhile ago  just kept cold in their fridgethe redeeming parts of this dinner was the decor  old fashioned coin operated games and the mystery show  ive never been to one  was really excited  they started after we ate our entrees  intermissioned during dessert  the actors were super funny  interactive  my students loved them which of course makes me happy  seriously though their food is so bad|came here later in the evening on a weekday to an empty building no hostess no wandering servers no customers we had to search the place for someone to seat us and the first people we ran into were a couple of offduty servers who were rolling silverware the male kindly sat us and got our drinks for us it took a ridiculously long time for our server to even appear at our table and just as long for our food to come out to make everything worse the only other couple in the restaurant who were sitting behind us were complaining to the server about their food the server returned to their table a bit later no manager and said that the manager told him that since the food is made early in the day it can lose texture and flavor by the time it is served what seriously it was hard to enjoy our food at all by the time it arrivedthe food left much the be desired the service was the worst ive ever encountered i dont usually leave complaints on restaurant websites but i had to leave one for this terrible visit they gave us a coupon for a free appetizer needless to say we did not return to redeem it|this was the first time my husband and i have been here we went with my sisterinlaw her boyfriend and his sister as it is a tradition to go around christmas for the boyfriends family well we were not impressed at all even the bf wasnt happy this time we didnt have the best waitress as she would run off too quicklyfor us to say much and we thought forgot about us the drinks took so long she finally showed and said she had dropped them and had to make them again we ordered and the wait wasnt too terribly bad for the food being a saturday night in pittsburgh though it was after  when we arrived i didnt care much forthe garlicky butter that came with the sourdough but the bread was hot and fresha balloon artist came around and made a flamingo that had to be  feet tall for the bfs sister and a little penguin for the sil he later came back unasked and gave her a  ft penguin with a hockey stick and puck in its hands we finally got our soup which did take a while to come out three ofus had the wedding soup and none of us liked it the sils bf said it didnt even taste like wedding soup but like chicken soup with meatballs granted ive been a little stuffy lately but the broth barely tasted like wedding soup broth to me eitheri had the fettucine alfredo which was ok i ate more of it than i might have were i not eating for two right now  i added pepper because it was rather plainnot even a garnish my husband said his spaghetti and meatballs was just ok the bf had ordered an italian margarita i believe it was called and drank the first one though it wasnt mixed right as you could taste the tequila and there was no salt he even added sugar trying to improve it the second he gave back and the waitress didnt even apologize or take it off the bill she went into the kitchen and started complaining loudly and our table was near the kitchen then she shows up with the check and we had to wait for her to come back to split it  ways since there was  couples and one other at the table the bad drink was still there and my sil was thoroughly pissed by then and went to talk to the manager and told him about overhearing her and all he did was take the one drink off i noticed while reading our check that the entrees were correct but that she had us as having a salad and minestrone when we both had wedding soup i didnt say anything since the price was the samethe balloons artist was great but we wont be going back just to see him|this place is dead but they just dont know it yet  arrived on a rainy wednesday around pm   minute wait for a table so i guess they are doing well right  we should have known better when we sat in the bar area to wait me my spouse and my eightyearold son after the rather apathetic frontdesk person took our name  a couple tables taken but no sign of staff in the bar  every table was dirty covered with plates glasses and the remains of others  we took one that had just a couple of glasses and an impressive amount of parmesan cheese scattered about  took  minutes for any sign of a bartender who promptly spent five minutes getting caught up on drink orders before wandering over  no smile no welcome just what do you want and are you waiting for a table  and certainly no let me clean this table for you  we had a beer and a wine and a root beer for the little one  the pinot grigio was vile but hey thanks for charging us for the more expensive version lord knows how disgusting the cheaper version would have been   finally after  minutes we were seated  not a table in the bar area had been cleaned in that periodand the restaurant is empty  maybe  full  they made us wait simply because they cant staff correctly  acres of empty tables  so we sit look at the menu check out the surrounding few tables and made the only good decision we made this night  we left and found another place in the area  a place that actually worked to seat us and made us feel welcomethe most amazing thing  between the greeter the bartender and the seater there was not a single smile  not a single sign that they actually are happy that we chose their establishment  and not a sign that that they gave a damn whether we ever wanted to come back  no wonder it is  empty but still makes people waitthe other reviews compare this to olive garden and the like  as my review makes clear i cant compare the food  and i am certainly not a fan of the olive garden  but the few times i have gone into one i was made to feel welcome  certainly not here  the place is living off memories  i dont think it is creating any new positive ones|i went to the spaghetti warehouse on a sunday afternoon   it was for a late lunch about  pm when we arrived  we were greeted by the hostess who took us to our table which was in the trolley car  its a visually interesting place to dine  however our chairs were rickety and appeared ready to collapse the restaurant was mostly empty which was not a surprise as we got there after the prime lunch hour but before dinner  and yet although there wasnt a lot of other customers there all vying for the attention of the servers it took an unusually long time for our waitress to arrive at our table  a pattern which continued throughout the duration of our stay   on the back of the menu there is a section for lunch entrees  i ordered the amazing  layer lasagne   the three other people in my party all ordered the spaghetti with meatballs   the food wasokay  nothing to write home about  ive been eating italian food for almost five decades  and this is average  at best  id say on par or slightly below olive garden  it wasnt the worst food but certainly not the best  and again i cannot overemphasize how below par the service was   but the thing which really upset me was when we got our check  they charged us dinner prices for each of our meals   again there is one menu and the pack of the menu has the lunch section  it reads until  pm   what i failed to see because its in fine print is the part where they only offer lunch prices monday through friday   really  really   are you kidding me   thats bs no matter how you view it  at no time did either the hostess or the waitress bother to explain to us up front that the lunch pricing wasnt in effect   i hate being ripped off  and any restaurant which does that kind of crap is ripping people off   so congratulations spaghetti warehouse  you got the better of me  and i will never ever go there again|i wanted to like it here in fact i have in the past we used to come here for college events and schedule ahead of time for a large group  then again this was always on weeknights when they were slow thank goodness i always loved the food here then again these dishes arent anything scientific  they are basic  comfort food and i thought the gigantic restaurant could handle large groups well until i brought  people here for a birthday dinner on a saturday first of all we had reservations but still stood awkwardly in the waiting area for a while to be seated not terrible then we were seated  the server was flustered and irritated before we had a chance to speak long story short we waited  hours for our food pasta yes  the stuff you make at home for an entire family in  minutes the waitress spent all her time coming to her table bashing the kitchen staff to us not exactly professional and the manager was no where to be seen cmon manager its your job to sail this ship  get it together from my line of vision i could see about  servers running around like chickens with their heads cut off doing nothing but throwing the kitchen staff under the bus dear manager if you have this many employees standing around doing nothing but complaining put a few of them to work in the kitchen the place is cute and i really want to like it again but i probably wont return until the management learns how to manage true this isnt capital grill nor was i expecting star service in all honesty im from the middleofnowhere ohio i didnt even know what fine dining was until college its just that ive had better service at arbys on a friday at  noon when they have a line  people deep and cars wrapped around the building  times in the drivethru saving grace the sangria was good thankfully because thats the only thing we consumed for  minutes while waiting on our lukewarm dinners to arrive|we came to spaghetti warehouse because it used to be a great restaurant  years ago the evening we visited we had not made a reservation so we expected to have a little wait when we walked up to the hosts counter we noticed the bar was empty there were three hostesses behind the counter talking with who we assumed to be the manager when the manager walked away one hostess picked up a ringing phone while the other two stood there staring anywhere but at us when the hostess finally got off the phone she did not greet us we had to ask if there was a wait and how long when we were told there was a  min wait we had to ask if the bar was available the information was not offered to us the hostess said yes and handed us menus and pointed up the stairs she did not show us where to go we then sat down and waited another min to get service from the bar staff she seemed to be the only one working at the bar on this busy night we wanted to be easy on the girl because she was apparently alone behind the bar but she was very rude it took about  min for our food to come out the chicken tasted like frozen grilled outofabag chicken and the wild mushroom creams sauce was condensed cream of mushroom soup the pesto my boyfriend ordered was drowning in olive oil i would like to say this was an unusually bad night however when i saw several waiters and waitresses gabbing and paying little attention to customers its hard to believe it was a one time thing at one point a waiter stopped and stood watching the football game that was on the tv for about min needless to say we will not be giving warehouse another chance|arrived at  on a saturday night there was a  minute wait although although empty tables were visible  got seated at  put order in shortly thereafter  we got bread and our soups fairly quickly then sat for an hour without any signs of food  we looked around the restraint and it was obvious other tables had been waiting and were getting frustrated  the waitress apologized the kitchen was slow so we gave it another  minutes before we finally walked out at  still hungry  the food i saw looked good but i would never recommend this place  it doesnt take over an hour and a half to make a friggin salad and pasta|this is a one time visit the worst service ever it was almost empty and twice we had to have someone find our waitress the food was mediocre at best the bruschetta appetizer for  had  tiny pieces of bread with some tomatoes on top not even shaved cheese nothing total waste of money the lasagna that they claim is so great in my opinion was diner quality and that might insult some great diners|i went here after seeing a musical and it was terrible  my sister and i ordered the seafood mediterraneo which is supposed to have clams and shrimp in a creamy sauce  there was only one shrimp in mine and the sauce wasdefinitely not what i call creamy  my sister sent hers back because it was cold  i was starved so tried some of mine as still a little warm  the place is old and outdated and the restrooms were horrible  save your money and make spaghetti at home  not the same nice place with delicious food that i remember from  years ago|we came to spaghetti warehouse  because it used to be a great restaurant the evening we visited we had not made a reservation so we expected to have a little wait there were some people waiting in the lobby and what appeared to be a birthday party happening in the dining room when we walked up to the hosts counter we noticed the tables at the bar were empty there were three hostesses behind the counter talking with who we assumed to be the manager when the manager walked away one hostess picked up a ringing phone while the other two stood there staring anywhere but us when the hostess finally got off the phone she did not greet us in any way we had to ask if there was a wait and for how long when we were told there was a  min wait we had to ask if the bar was available she did not offer this option the hostess said yes and handed us menus and pointed up the stairs toward the bar she did not show us where to go after sitting down we then waited another min to put in our drink order the woman waiting on us seemed to be the only one working in the bar area on this busy night we wanted to be easy on the girl because she was apparently alone behind the bar but she was very rude after waiting min to put in our drink order it then took another min to get our drinks it took about  min for our food to come out the chicken tasted like frozen outofabag grilled chicken and the wild mushroom cream sauce was condensed cream of mushroom soup my boyfriends pesto was swimming in olive oil i would like to say this was an unusually bad night however when i saw several waiters and waitresses gabbing and paying little attention to customers its hard to believe it was a one time thing at one point a waiter stopped and stood watching the football game that was on the tv for about min the only think i liked were the womens restrooms they were nice and clean needless to say we will not be giving warehouse another chance summary awful service terrible food nice bathrooms i would rather go to olive garden than here|a long long time ago in a far away place i used to go to a place called spaghetti warehouse that was cool clean had good service and had really good food but that place is gone and now im left at this place that is dirty has horrible service and mediocre food the end never coming back|no nope uh uh no way please dont call this an italian restaurant overcooked mushy noodles watery tomato gravy and meatballs that are too garlicky and over spiced cant give this place anything lower than  star seriously olive garden is a joke and i rate it higher than this place again my advice to any italian food lover find a good neighborhood family owned restaurant and support a family and not a conglomerate|took two and a half hours to get our food all our food was the thrown together in the same pan not worth the |ordered delivery the food showed up  hours laterwhich is acceptable as its just within the delivery window specified however the food had apparently been prepared within  minutes of receiving our order because it was cold by the time we got it i didnt listen to the other reviews and paid the price literally if someone else is saved a crappy sw dinner by this review my meal or lack thereof will not have been in vain|worst place ever  i took my friend there for the first time and my son  we waited a hour for food  the waiter got us out water not our sangria   min later out salads and after  another  min of my kid begging for his pizza we decided to go  the reason they messed up the order  we talked to the manager im assuming which didnt really care  said hopefully we come back because service isnt usually this bad never again unprofessional and rude|ewww the food here is terrible  nothing i had tasted good  it tasted like it had been sitting under the food warmers for hours  the service is luke warm at best  just skip it  theres so many other places out there for good italian food|we went here with sixteen people the only good thing about our visit was having dinner with a bunch of our friends the service was pretty good to considering the large party my wife and i got the sicilian sampler appetizer and the ultimate feast for two as our dinner entree the calamari was uneatable and the ravioli was just down right nasty the wedding soup was the worst i have ever had the meat balls had absolute no taste kind of like cardboard the pork sausage tasted burnt the spaghetti tasted no different than boxed pasta the lasagna might have had  layers but  of them were noodles and sauce you had to search for any meat or cheese our garlic bread came out literally black i cant even believe somebody would serve that we will not be back|i stopped in here with my family the day before thanksgiving my sister niece and parents were at the childrens museum and were struck by a fit of nostalgiamy mom used to take us here when we were kids either the whole operation has gone severely downhill or i was too young to notice how bad it all isbetween all of us we ordered chicken alfredo lasagna and cheese ravioli every dish had several things wrong with it the chicken was likely cooked the week before in a dirty cafeteria then shipped to the strip district it was dry and looked reconstituted the ravioli were lukewarm at best and my sister said the lasagna tasted microwaved even the bread was staleour waitress was also forgetful and a bit cold i didnt get a salad i ordered dishes stayed on the table fifteen or twenty minutes after being empty and water refills were inconsistent as a former server myself id like to think i know what is in ones control and what is out of ones control this woman was simply not up to snuffwith lidias right down smallman street i have no idea how the warehouse is staying in business spend a few extra dollars and go there itll be worth it|i am having a difficult time determining which is worse the spaghetti warehouse or the olive garden  mushy spaghetti drenched in the worst sauce i ever had  ok on second thought the olive garden is better|i wish it were possible to give this place  stars i ate here twice hated the food both times and felt like i was in a bizzaro funhouse instead of a restaurant they clearly thing that if they go for the most ridiculous decor they can imagine it will distract from their lousy food theyre wrong|the pasta is consistently overcooked the service is not only poor but the staff are rude i will not visit this restaurant again im not italian but i cook way better than this myself|weve eaten a number of superb meals at the mortons in cincinnati and were eagerly looking forward to a sumptious dinner at mortons in pittsburgh oh boy the ambiance is more like a wendys that tries to be upscale cramped busy somewhat noisy of the two filet mignons we had different sizes medium rare one was horribly overcooked the other one a little on the rare side the meat wasnt special the deserts were ok but the creme brulee was bland in the extreme service was ok but occasionally inattentive for two adults one child a check of  would have been reasonable for the quality provided it ended up being  or so oh well  i rounded up the check to  and left with the intention of never coming back again imagine my shock when i found that my credit card had been charged with  im sure this will turn out to be an innocent mistake but if this restaurant thinks it provides an experience worth  per head they need to call chef ramsey|i dined at mortons last night jan    the food was not good  i feel i paid  for a  meal  service was great but it sure wasnt mortons quality  what the hell is going on people  with my uncle and myself our bill was  dollars and that was with only  glasses of wine  omg the cheese cake  at  was very dry  im thinking all the chefs quit after the fire and being closed for so long and mortons are breaking in the new guys  yes this was last night  bob segar concert  please fix it|to all mortons contacted me and has sent a  gift certificate for our lousy dinner january   our dinner for two was  tip   is not working for me  just thought i would let them know  i hope everyone has better success than we did  good luck allj rock|i love a good steak which i did have my first visit here but this visit was just awful i took my hubby here for a fathers day dinner i feel so bad i definitely have to take him somewhere elsethe bread didnt seem fresh it was dry with an intense dry onion rub salads were ok probably my favorite part of the meal actually the steak i ordered medium due to being pregnant but it was rare he got his medium as well and was actually done medium my baked potato side was pretty good its hard to mess up microwaving a potato his side of mac and cheese was laughable we were warned numerous times how hot the bowl was it came in but the actual dish was cold cheese was hard boxed mac and cheese would have been so much better the desserts i cant really say anything about im not much of a sweets personstaff was pretty attentive you literally take one sip of water and they refill it i guess i should complain about the service but it ruined the meal having them step in between us  times i had to laugh when the one refill splashed my husband in the face mid sentencedefinitely wont be back too many other good options that dont disappoint|we had dinner tonight and were so disappointed we had a party of  and the service was so slow we ended up serving the cake ourselves the food was bland at best they do not have a childrens menu the only thing that was efficient was the valet service we wont be back|i am the dorkie kid from your kindergarten  class who has been wearing glasses since i was  years old so please take this review seriously  i know my way around a pair of eyeglasses  wow am  i getting old  that would mean i have been wearing eye glasses for  years  do me  you and everyone you care about a favor and avoid this location  the service is here so incredibly inconsistent  i have nothing  i mean nothing good do say about the service that i have received here the eye glass assistants are rude  the way you are treated is sub par  americas best i even hesitate to use that name because its obviously not the best in america just sucks   due to my terrible eye site i have to spend extra money for thin lens  so normally what i do is  once a year i shell out   no insurance to buy two pair of glasses paying cash  the frames are alright but nothing that great besides my lens not being great another thing i  have a problem with is the poor customer service on more then one occasion through out the years i have been talked down to  i have been wearing my current prescription from ab for about  months this prescription is not good for me before i had a magnified prescription that made everything bigger my poor little blind self i have an astingamstism in both eyes two years ago i got good lens with nice frames but in   i got shit lens with an okay frame  i dont plan on returning to americas best  its just not worth it|if you look at my yelp reviews i never give  star but this was the worst costumer service experiences ive had in my entire life the entire staff was rude they made us feel like it was such an inconvenience from lady at the reservation desk who frowned snarled and barked commands like we were in a prison to the embittered woman who was supposed to help run our insurance information this experience made me feel belittled and terrible before arriving we checked with our insurance companies that americas best would honor our insurance but when we got there the lady said that they do not take our insurance after begging and pleading that they call our insurance company she finally did and while frowning told us that she was wrong and they americas best actually did take our insurance we were so disgusted with our experience here we called the corporate office something i never do afterward and told them that when are contacts arrive we will not go back to this location the people at the corporate office were actually really nice and had them shipped to the north hills location instead when we went to pick out our contacts at north hills the staff was very pleasant but it was too little too late the downtown office has ruined americas best for me forever honestly i have been telling everyone i know never to go to this sub par establishment|i got an eye exam and two pairs of expensive eye glasses in pittsburgh downtown branch it was a horrible experience firstly they sold me sample pairs without telling me i paid more than  for two pairs when i received the eyeglasses luckily i understood there is a problem with them i went back to the store they insist they are new pairs i asked to see the samples and such a coincidence they were not there anymore i asked them to check the inventory and they agreed that they are samples i had to choose new two pairs but most of the models they have were already so low quality and old fashion i chose one rayban and one calvin k they were over priced than the market i had to go to store three times it means three days permission from the office and i had to deal w parking in downtown a horrible and rude customer service i think they took advantage of me being an international student i am writing this comment to save other people|pros ambiance  prettiest venue in downtown pittsburgh space  you can fit a ton of people in the space ranias catering required vendor and provided great servicecons sound  due to the vaulted ceilings we were never able to get good sound on the mics there was an echo and most people could not understand anyone talking mcs speeches etc super disappointing not to hear your father or father in laws speech  management  the venue attracts well to do clientele but the service does not match the price tag with high quality and accommodating management service they are more like mean museum curators in the planning process  hotels are far superior in management service common space is not exclusive building residents are allowed to join and sometimes harass during dinner my fiance i and the photographer went to the rotunda to take pictures a resident came downstairs and started doing tai chi in the middle of my party a  yo man brought out a lawnchair and watched her we held our tongue and ignored them but the man shouted at us of all the places in pittsburgh why do they have to take pictures on our property and in our way  i told them we had rented the entire venue and it was actually private property and they told me to shut up me the brideim not saying it was a situation of racism but i wonder if they would have been as ugly if i was a white bride in a white wedding dress instead of a foreign bride in a red sari my father in law tried to pacify the situation and told everyone to just calm down then the old man stepped up to my new father in law in a aggressive way as if to make him flinch i told them i am the bride why are you trying to ruin my wedding dayresponse shut up b and go inside they were joined by another older couple that also chimed in with aggressive and angry language about how they lived there and i was on their private property as we cut our session short and walked back inside i didnt know i had to hire security to protect myself from the pennsylvanian residents when they started behaving physically aggressive my coordinator called the police the angry senior citizens also told the police that my photographer who never even spoke instigated the situation afterwards pa management did not take a side in the situation and even suggested we were responsible for the situation occurring  everything must be brought in from the outside tables chairs kitchen supplies silverware|our wedding was this past saturday  it was rainy cold and miserable outside  we hoped to get just a few pictures in nice dry places to help commemorate the daywe stopped by the pennsylvanian to get a few shots  we were promptly told in rude and vindictive manner that we were trespassing and the police would be called if we did not immediately leavei understand that they would not want us to use their overhang to take a picture since we did not decide to use this venue for our reception but if the manner in which we were ordered off the property is any indication of the staffs demeanor i would recommend staying as far away from this place as possibleour friends one of whom was a groomsman in our party were deliberating choosing this venue for their reception next year  they had a bad experience with the staff as well when trying to tour the venue after my experience with our wedding i can tell you that service is one of if not the most important parts of the day  choose wisely and stay very very very far away from places with staff like the pennsylvanian|dont waste your time they dont sell regular paper and hardly have poster paper its really hard to find any thing of use most things are archaic and not in a cool vintage way the owner is a bitch during parking day  she waited  hours before coming out and telling the artist  i find what you are doing is discussing i dont support your tree hugger shit extraordinarily rude|i went here around noon one day in search of an ink pad which i thought would be a pretty standard item for a stationery store  turns out i was wrong  the store was such a cramped crowded mess that i had to ask for help to find what i was looking for but was hesitant to do so because i felt so awkward interrupting the four employees sitting at a table in a corner eating leftover pasta and engrossed in conversation ignoring me and the several other customers who were browsing  when i finally got the courage to ask about the ink pad the workers all looked at each other as if to say whos going to handle this before one of them grudingly got up to search for an ink pad that as it turned out didnt come in with the shipment  as if pittsburgh was a hot market for ink pads and they go through their entire supply every week|i stopped in because they have knitting supplies i immediately saw a beautiful cat they have several in this shop being a owner of several cats and extreme lover of all animals i went over to see the cat the cat let me pet it and followed me around yowling for attention i picked up the cat to hold and the man that works there was very rude and ripped the cat away from me i will never never go back to a store that treats animals or animal lovers that way the shop isnt that great anyway|such a shame because this place has so much potential for being a cool little local business but the ownersmanagers are the rudest most disdainful people who seemed almost gleeful for me to leave without purchasing something i went in to purchase either some classy paper or a unique card to write a note to a homeowner to whom i was considering placing a purchase offer for their house its a stationary store so i didnt think my request was unusual the products there were outdated in many cases even dusty overpriced which honestly i would have paid a local business if the product had been unique and quality and disorganized i was asked if i needed help to which i replied yes and explained my situation and a very curt man stood in a back corner and pointed to various corners of the store and said look there and there and there and there and then he walked out of the storeill seriously never step foot in weldins again and felt it necessary to post publicly about the experience such a shamebtw i found a delightful card next door at cvs it was made of wood very unique go figure |i have been a customer of this store many many times in the past  i go there only because they are the only source of yarn in the downtown area and im an avid knitter  i put up with the rude employees and dirty store because of this  i was actually a little excited when they moved because i was looking forward to visiting a clean store  here is where my mistake happened  i recommended them to a coworker  she just called to ask where they had moved too i was unsure of the address and its not on their website or here on yelp  when she asked the woman how ansered the phone if she could tell her where they moved the woman hesitated and said yes i guess  im sure she thought we was being funny  then she simply said they were located in the gulf tower  when my coworker asked where that was the woman laughed at her and said in a very rude tone on grant street  my coworker has only lived in pittsburgh for a year as you all know pittsburgh is not the easist city to learn  when pressed for further information about the location the woman had the nerve to raise her tone of voice and tell my coworker that the building had only been there for  yearssad very very sad  they are absolutly destroying their reputation|i found a short black curly hair in my basket of fries and it was definitely not mineneedless to say this completely ruined my meal thanks to peppis i wont be eating anything that isnt readytoeat as is like fruit for the next few daysnot only does the shop look grimey it is grimey completely disgusted|i went down to the strip last week and thought a mocha sounded great well i cant write a review on that drink because the employee dropped a dime in my drink i was expecting her to offer to make me a new one since she was the one the dropped it in there but instead all i got a was blank stare the coffee shop down the street had great coffe and they dont drop anything in there as well|do not go here during the week if you expect them to open on time i was there today and it was am and there was no employees at all managed very poorly the older lady with a short hair cut is the one who doesnt open on time when she is scheduled please move this lady to a different time am is too early for her|out of  reviews ive written only   star reviews  thats   that means i never really write  star reviews  la prima espresso in the strip district gets one  theyve got a good coffee but i will never be back bc the older woman who is the barista in the morning was unforgivably rude without reasonthe coffee is good i would have liked to become a regular but i dont want to start every morning dealing with her nasty attitude  yesterday she rolled her eyes at me when i asked for lots of room for creami am a former barista  i know asking for room for cream is not one of the more difficult special requests she gets  if you hate the public you shouldnt work with themthis morning takes the cake and i just wont be back  heres what happened  i walked in and she was talking to a gentleman who was obviously a regular  because she was busy and bc ive baristad myself i waited patientlyand waited and waited  it was a few minutes but an eternity when you really need coffeeshe never even looked at me  then all of a sudden she goes okay lady are you going to stand there or do you want coffee  wtf  i liked her sense of urgency but seriously  rudei asked for a medium coffee in a large cup or if thats not possible a medium coffee with lots of room not hearing me she goes what was that and the older gentleman said she wants a medium sized coffee in a large cup  and the woman turns to me and snaps and you couldnt repeat that yourselfeven the guy she was talking to her regular was like whoa  he tried to make some excuse for her like shes just fired up today  then the woman slams my coffee down on the counter  was she having a bad day  am i the doppleganger of someone she hates  i dont know i dont care  i believe she may be the owner because surely she should have been fired by now as there are other posts with complaints about her do not go here during the week if you expect them to open on time i was there today and it was am and there was no employees at all managed very poorly the older lady with a short hair cut is the one who doesnt open on time when she is scheduled please move this lady to a different time am is too early for her i wont ever be back  if thats just her spunky personality well her personality sucks  seriously lady youre not a morning person  you should ask for later shifts|id had a nail appointment set for several weeks  a first time customer  less than an hour before the appointment i got a call canceling it  not from the owner apologizing for the cancellation or trying to correct the situation somehow but from the nail tech  she told me the owner insisted that she call her clients herself to tell them she had personal problems that day and couldnt make it  wow  the lack of professionalism astounded me  on the positive side im glad i had the experience before what may have been the worst nail experience of my life  imagine how the personal problems may have affected the work  i called the salon to let them know of my disappointment in being left high and dry  they simply didnt care  they lost a customernot just for nails but for all the other services they offer  not the best way to run a service business|worst brazilian wax i have ever gotten extremely painful and inefficient still had a red welt  days later she also used the same stick the entire time which is not sanitary eyebrow waxing is significantly overpriced at  do not go here for waxing|if i can give haft a star i would never shop at this asian grocery since many more open owner and employee alike no manners and nasty sorry guys its the truth|i strongly not recommend this store at all for their rudeness the middle aged woman and the other man seem like manager are extremely mean without any manner i recommend other asian markets|as lindsays best friend and maid of honor i went with her to jim ludwigs a few weeks before her wedding to go over the final order for the flowers  we sat down and jim pulled out a list of what they had discussed  i very clearly remember her confirming dahlias and peonies for the centerpieces  not only do i know that she wanted these flowers from the moment of her engagement but i was also at the consultation to witness the discussion  the centerpieces were definitely not what she had requested  no peonies or dahilias and they looked like flowers picked from the side of the road on the way to the wedding  in no way did the flowers manage to ruin her beautiful day but they were absolutely not what she requested or confirmed  i dont understand how there was a miscommunication as i saw the paperwork  i just know that i wont be using jim ludwigs for any of my own special occassions|i ordered a sympathy arrangement for my aunts funeral i requested the flowers to be delivered for the family viewing on friday at pm i arrived and was disappointed to not see the arrangement i ordered after two calls to the florist it was determined that another customer had also ordered a arrangement for my aunt and wanted their order delivered to the church on saturday for the viewing prior to the funeral as a result someone at the florist decides to deliver my flowers not as requested for friday but on saturday imagine my frustration i will say after speaking to the owner jim ludwig he did offer to still bring the arrangement to the funeral home  no need the viewing was over by the time the situation was sorted out he offered to discount my order by  which was a acceptable gesture but at the end of the day it really wasnt about the money overall was a frustrating and disappointing customer experience for me at what was already a difficult time for me and my family|unsatisfied customer i ordered a get well bouquet  pictured arrangement was  i wanted a premium arrangement so i ordered the  bouquet how disappointing has a few lillys  roses rest is carnations a few babys breath and filler for  plus delivery will take my business elsewhere in the future one star is for same day delivery|walked into roxannes which was full of beautiful and inspiring arrangements only to be caught off guard at how rude the owner was was going to purchase a few items but decided to take my money elsewhere|im sorry but as cool as andy is i just dont like the sushi  the tuna tasted metallic and mealy definitely not fresh  i actually spit it out in my napkin upon first bite  the portions are large yes and the prices are good but id rather pay a little more for sushi that is less suspect|first do not call me sexy and then give me the two most sinewy pieces of toro possible that pissed me right off second the rolls here are sloppy not only did it fall apart very quickly and was about  times too large to eat a piece of sushi should be able to be comfortably eaten in one bite but it seems there isnt much thought given to flavors as far as the special rolls go after my experience with the toro i dont think i will be giving any sashimi or  sushi sushi rolls a try while the rolls are large the prices were quite steep not what i was expecting for someone based in a market that sells seafood|check your candy purchase for freshness  i bought  boxes of marshmallow cones  i carried them on a plane to dallas tx for my adult niece  when she opened one of the individually wrapped cones the marshmallow top was as hard as meringue  i was embarrassed that i gave her old candy that was just purchased days before  when i returned to pittsburgh i called fort pitt  they said they couldnt do anything unless i returned the candy  no apology no concern  i will not shop there again  you can find fresh cones and candy at other stores|as of july   a sign on the front said that it was closed permanently|ew ew gross i know thats not the most mature thing to say but thats what comes to mind when i think about this place sad thing is ive been here a couple times every time i kept thinking it would somehow get better but no it doesnt the miso soup they serve has this weird after taste and to be honest doesnt taste like any miso soup ive ever had so on to the sushi oh yeah its gross too i think i kept going back because the size of the rolls are humongous the thing is the fish does not taste fresh at all its always luke warm andjustnotgood oh well i tried but id suggest you not|absolutely the worst sushi my husband and i have ever had  it was gross i dont know why they use so much rice or why the fish wasnt cold  you couldnt pay me to go back to this place|if youre in the mood for fresh tasty sushi this is not the place for you the food that was delivered to us was simply inedible point blank my husband and i ordered a bunch of sushi for dinner with the plan of having tasty leftovers for lunch the next day so we splurged a little spent like  on various rolls the presentation was pretty pathetic  wilting nori leading us to believe these rolls were premade hot pink ginger meaning its the msgsoaked kind gluelike rice where you cant see the individual grains  but what really horrible was the smell when we took the lid off the tray the stench of rotten fish knocked both if us back i honestly gaggedit was so awful we just stared at each other amazed that we just spent our money on a pile of stinking rot determined to not waste everything i picked up a piece of spider roll to sniffinspecttry it had a huge hair in it all wound around the crab totally disgusting my husband attempted to try the inari  just tofu and rice right it tasted like rotten fish as it had absorbed all the smells from the other fish rolls we had also ordered a vegetable and tofu soup and a green salad with ginger dressing cant even believe this but the salad leaves were brown and slimy on the ends they actually screwed up a green salad the soup tasted like the inside of an aluminum pot all metallic and burntflavored horrible horrible horrible we literally dumped everything down the garbage disposal total wastewe tried to call and complain but by the time our order was delivered the place was closed we will be calling again today to get our money back maybe they will earn themselves another star if they do the right thing and refund our money|being korean and my kids and i visit all the korean restaurants when we are out of town  since my daughter goes to pitt we wanted to treat our daughter to korean food  my family including my wife who is non korean always order    and if this is how they want to represent korean food to others they are doing disservice to our heritage   was the worst i have ever had  their  had lettuce as one of mixing choices and their meat was hamburger meat  will not go back|dont bother with the sushi cant speak to the korean bbqlong story short i ordered delivery never had sushi delivered before so maybe this is just the way it goes but it took almost two hours to get to me there was condensation inside the sushi container from the rolls sitting on top of the other entree id ordered which was hot and being held against it in a small bag assuming that the rolls were made long before i got them i just threw out the tuna roll which was warmer than room temp anyway vegetable roll was good but not exceptional fried rice wasjust not what i expected not exceptional either in short i paid almost  for a cucumber roll and two bites of rice maybe this is better when you dine in still would not recommend pricey and doesnt live up to it at all|i am sorry to say that this place still stinks  i work in the strip and often get temped by sushi kim  i stopped in for lunch today and i was the only person in the whole place  that should have tipped me off  the last time i was there i had a bad meal but i wanted to give them another shot  i ordered the spicy chicken off of the lunch menu  i believe is was lnumbered menu itemsanother tip   my food was terrible  the miso soup was horrid and old the sides were awful and everything seemed to be microwaved  avoid this place at all costs|tried this place based on reviews in local paper and friends this place was awful we asked questions of the server and ordered based on them neither was goody friend said she cannot eat real spicy food and asked them to tone it down her meal was so hot she couldnt eat it  mine was just disappointing the only thing i found good was the plain rice i also thought it was extremely over priced will not return|man really bad from start to finish service is slow and horrible sushi is not flavorful at all the rice was some of the worst i have ever had i honestly would rather eat day old gas station sushi than come here again|my grandma has season passes here every now and then there is a decent play here most of the time we leave at intermission unless like today there was no intermission buyer and cellar has got to be the most boring annoying not funny waste of time play couldnt keep my eyes openthey need to actually watch the plays they decide to put on here instead of putting all their energy into getting plays written by someone famous another waste of time wait until people my age get old i can guarantee you we will not be wasting our time in this theater you are going down just like the pso|want to start by saying that the show was spectacular and so was the venue however we arrived at our seats to find an usher no not a typo an usher occupying one of our seats in the third row in the middle the usher asked my girlfriend and i if we would be ok sitting apart as she was not going to move out of her seat she then proceeded to tell us that it wasnt a full house and we could find plenty of seats together higher up in the theatre and stayed in the seat for the duration of the show without helping anyone to their seats of course its a terrible shame it was a spectacular performance but i wont be buying tickets there anytime soon knowing that my seats arent guaranteed and can be occupied by employees at any given time|this place would be great if they answered their phones returns your calls or set up an actual appointment for you|pittsburgh has a shortage of riverfront dining so this place wins points for ambience on a nice warm day have a drink and enjoy the deck but save your dining budget for somewhere else  the menu is blah and the food is alsoi recently had lunch here and the waitress first forgot my meal entirely bringing food to everyone else at the table  when i reminded her she returned with my clam chowder spilled it didnt apologize and didnt clean it up  all that would have been forgiven if the soup had been any good|awful service overpriced food dont waste your money on arrival waitress seemed lost  ordered food for  adults one kid food came for adults after a couple of minutes my mom asked when my sons food would be coming waitress said she would check came back and said his pizza hadnt been cooked yet cancelled the pizza paid  for a little bowl of white lettuce with some cheese thrown on it fried shrimp was expense but looked like cookie cutter frozen shrimp spoke to manager who had a horrible attitude and found out that the waitress never put the pizza order in for my son and then lied and told the manager he wasnt at the table when we ordered our food if you give these people your money it would be foolish|the only reason anyone goes to this restaurant is to sit on the deck and drink  i want to like this place so badly i keep coming back and hoping that itll be awesome and it just never is  like dating someone who is very very hot but also very very stupid its amazing how much patience one can have if theres a really good atmosphereone year i took my father here for his birthday  i dont usually call people names but our waitress was just a complete idiot to the point we felt bad for her and that was the only reason we didnt freak out on her completely  she forgot my dads food order  she brought out mine but then neglected to notice that my dad was sitting there with nothing  the manager came out and took our drinks off hte tab btu that didnt help very much bc wed only been able to order one round in an hour of waiting bc the waitress had only come to our table twice  then when they brought my dads steak out the waitress dropped it i felt bad for her and apparently that was their last steak  i just paid the bill and we left and went to eat n parkthe second time i came back the service was equally as terrible but also it was late summer and our table was literally attacked by wasps  seriously attacked by wasps  my friend got stunganother time id made a reservation for my friends th bday and they said htey didnt do reservations but could put tables together  when we showed up it was like id never calledthe last time i was there it was ok but after being attacked by wasps my friend and i opted for the patio and only ordered burgersthe service here sucks  getting attacked by bees and then having to wait for your server to bring you ice sucks holding a cold beer bottle against the sting helps  it just sucks herebut the atmosphere is fantastic  when your waitress comes ot hte table just order a whole bunch of bottled beers nad you should be ok|dear redfin bluesi cant begin to express my disappointment in your establishment such high expectations were set when we were greeted at the host stand and sent of for cocktails on a  min wait list which apparently never existed after  mins and seeing literally  parties that noticeably came in after us be seated i reminded the host who directed us to the bar that we were still waiting after  more minutes and  more parties getting sat one who sat themselves i approached a blonde woman seating and cleaning tables to let her know that we could be removed from the list to which she replied what list and didnt even bother to apologize nothing was offered to assist us in our search for sustenance nor was there anything offered for our inconvenience fortunately for us the disaster at your restaurant lead us to discover a new place that we have decided to frequent so thank you for fking up|just returned from rfblues where i usually enjoy myself quite a lotthe bartender gave my sandwich by mistake to another customer no bigdeal pink salmon looks a lot like white chicken assuming shescolorblind i waitedand had a nd drinkanother group of  people came in after that ordered their meals andgot served their entreesi went up to the bartender and asked when my dinner would be comingshe announced that salmon takes longer to cook than what a rawsalad i cook salmon is one of the fastest things on earth to cookand that i was about to check on that it had been over an hour bynowi got my sandwich promptly after complaininga few minutes later when i finished my salmon i got my side ofvegetables apparently vegetables take even longer than salmon tocookall sarcasm aside one screw up is tolerable the second  forgettingto even check on my late order until i complained an hour after iordered is not and yet i wasnt given the least consideration inthe bill|it was my anniversary tonight a tuesday i was so excited to get all you can eat crab  legs my favorite food of all time but when we arrived at pm the very unfriendly waitress said that their kitchen was closed boooooooooo their website as well as yelp states that they are open until pm we wouldve been long gone by then very disappointing well we ended up driving a lot farther than we intended but had a wonderful dinner at joes crab shack in station square i got my legs and they had  hurricanes to boot ended up eating a better meal with cheaper drinks and we ended up tipping our waiter  because he was awesome shouldve just gone there in the first place i will know better from now on|not impressed we arrived at  ordered an appetizer and beers as we waited for the fifth and final member of our party ordered dinner at  pm some of the members of our party ordered crab legs which came out of the kitchen in a timely manner the rest of us waited an additional  minutes until a manager came over to explain that a pizza we ordered was taking longer than expected and would be out in  minutes  minutes later half of our party needed to leave they went home hungry and very unhappy luckily it was a beautiful day outside good luck redfin blues its not even summer yet yinz got some learning to do|it was a really nice day out so my boyfriend and i wanted to go somewhere where we could eat outdoors he had never been to redfin blues so we decided to go there it was memorial day so we expected it to be busy but when we got there they said there was only a  min wait that was definitely not the case thoughwe sat on some rocks nearby and waited for our buzzer to go off we waited and waited and waited there were many tables open which i think was also confusing people that were coming in after us we waited about  minutes and then overheard the hostess telling someone else the buzzers werent working so we turned in those even though there were a ton of tables open we werent allowed to even sit at them to get some drinks or eat chips etc we were told that they were pacing the flow of people because the kitchen was backed up and that was the reason for the empty tables  we were both amazed that we were not even allowed to sit down to get some drinks its their money that they lost i guess thoughafter waiting about    min we overhear a tablet nearby asking about their food the waitress tells them the kitchen is really backed up so their food isnt going to come for about  more minutes but she could get them some chips etc they had already been seated and placed their order about  min prior after hearing that we bailed i sadly cant even review the food because the wait was so unacceptable especially since we couldnt even sit down and get water or drinks when we told the hostess we were just leaving she didnt seem very apologetic either all she said was a quick sorry i really liked to stop at this place and get some lunch when i was riding my bike on the trail but my boyfriend said hed never go back|this store has great stuff in it and we all complemented the woman working on how great the store was when we were leaving i was with  white people and  black person when we left the worker pulled the black person aside and demanded to check his pockets she did and found nothing in the middle of the strip district this store can still be racist|stopped in looking to furnish my new apartment i was the only customer in the place on a weekday afternoon i was never greeted by sales staff or acknowledged there was an older woman and a younger woman working as i was browsing the jewelry the older woman said loud enough so i could hear for the younger sales associate to watch me so i didnt steal anything and im a white young professional so i can only imagine how other people are treated|i hate to write mean reviews but i really did receive the worst haircut of my life no hyperbole from this place one that really cant be fixed now until i wait for it to grow out  i walked in with long hair and normallooking bangs that all needed significant trimming  the stylist said he would need to take a couple of inches off of the length due to damage  i said that was fine  i did not ask for any other style changes  i somehow walked out with bangs that take up most of the front part of my head much like a small childs haircut to serve the purpose of keeping hair out of the childs face  he also took almost five inches off the length instead of the couple promised  i feel like my haircut looks like a cross between a bowl cut a female mullet and the futuristic look of mia wallace from pulp fiction  im pretty open minded to different haircuts but this one is truly awful and its too short now for me to even pull it back easily to try to make it look better  im going to a place in shadyside today to see if they can maybe do extensions to remedy the mullet look or implement some kind of other cut to make it look a little better  its a shame because this place is downtown and so convenient to my workplace but i certainly will not risk it again|at  am i walked in and ordered a chicken biscuit the girl at the register walked around for a second came back and said were out so i asked what time they stop serving breakfast and she said  am she then said that the girl whos cooking would have to make it so i asked if that was going to happen she walks over to three people standing around in the kitchen asks the cook if shell be making any more and the cook looks up at me makes a rude face and says no the woman cook then proceeded to go back to talking to the other cooks while leaning on the oven at that point i wouldve just taken a plain biscuit its disgusting that there are people who have jobs and then go to work and stand around and get paid to do nothing i mean how do you tell a customer  minutes before breakfast ends that youre just not going to make any more biscuits a complete lack of work ethic its disgusting i looked at the girl and said so youre just not going to make any then laughed and walked out my advice hire someone who would be grateful to have a job and who would take pride in it those people do exist you dont have to have people in the kitchen who act like that|rotten food and over charging customeri was expecting at least a reasonable dinning experience at a reputed restaurant but was greatly disappointed the restaurant charged me  premium over prices on online menu i ordered takeout denied there are prices online the maitre d was reluctant to show the printed menu which is  more expensive than online led me to think the over charge was deliberate the crab cake sandwich is well prepared but from rotten crab since i didnt have time to walk min one way to return the food it had to be thrown away   a lunch over charged and wasted|as a lifelong pittsburgher ive been to tambellinis enough times over the years  and i think its still open simply because of its location practically next door to the benedum and patrons who go there arent the regular theatergoers  i was invited to go with friends who were old enough to remember when it was probably goodthe prices are outrageously high for the quality of the food and portions  i had the chicken marsala which was alright but something i normally eat served out of a chafing dish at a funeral buffet this was comparable to a catered version and the restaurant itself deserves a funeral its outdated and just a factory for getting people in and out and on time to the cultural events theyre going tothe waitress was nice enough seemed a bit embarrassed to respond no when i asked if certain menu items were fresh  on the other hand she disappeared quite a bit and didnt ask if we wanted any desserts  which we probably wouldve if wed been askedeven though downtown after business hours isnt the most exciting place to eat there are other places ill insist on going instead of back to tambellinis|avoid except for sheer laughsthis place is just textbook in terms of epitomizing what not to do in a fancy italian restaurant  meals are  a plate but ask your waiter for a bottle of prosecco and he says what is that  we ordered a gin and tonic watched him make it and were served our mixed drink literally with no ice  who serves a drink without ice  we had no silverware had to request it repeatedly  our entrees dessert and coffee all came out at different times  we received the check before being asked if we even wanted dessert or coffee for that matterso  service aside the food is just mediocre and of no relevance to the italian inspiration it proclaims  our stuffed banana pepper appetizer was too hard to cut with a fork but we had no knives  the prime rib was fatty and cold  the crab cakes were far more cake than crab you had to eat around it leaving a pile of filler mush  pasta was just pasta  the atmosphere is also drab and just depressing  and the split plate fee is exorbitant so we lied and shared food anyway  note that our check was still nearly   for only five of usreally truly avoid this place at all costs unless youre looking for a good story to laugh about  the only redeeming quality here after an overpriced meal was that it left our party of  with a good story to tellthis is the second time ive been here the first time we just had sandwiches in the basement and it was also far from memorableavoid|its just not that good we initially told the waitress that we only going to order appetizers and desert my code for we read on yelp this place sucks but we wanted to give it a try to which she replied they dont alow that but i will let it slide the food could have come from a buffet and been better i hate to be super negative but in this case i am just being real|this place is just a flat out joke  totally overpriced  went before a show and they gave a limited menu and tacked on the token  service fee which gave them the right to provide lousy service  first i asked for the beer they had on the chalkboard outside  had no clue what i was talking about  finally gave up and got a coors lite  food was overpriced and less than average  i had the baked scrod  exact same dish at eat n park is  and better than this  dish  i would stay clear of this at all costs  if you are going for a night of theater  opt for eating outside the city or at sonoma grill down the street  im shocked this place is still in business|since closed  surprise surprise|the only good thing about this eatery is its proximity to the benedum the three of us were seated at a table that was jammed in between two other tables next to the kitchen  even though the place was half empty i could hear the conversation at the next door table better than that of people sitting opposite me the food was a sorry sloppy soggy mess that would have had chef ramsey throw up the service was slow inattentive and made you feel vaguely unwelcome ridiculously overpriced for  better value a nicer atmosphere and quality food i strongly recommend a couple of places nearby that beat tambellinis hands down  mcdonalds or subway|the view at sognatore is beatiful from the th or so story of the pennsylvanian i went for my trial run for my wedding do a month before the big day armed with a picture of how i wanted my hair based on a test run done by my salon in the city where i live not pittsburgh the guy did not listen to me at all and created some overthetop pittsburgh do with tons of hairspray i got him to agree that on the wedding day he would use way less spray and make the bun looser and lower to be more natural i paid my    for test makeup and then i booked hair and makeup for  other people on the day of the wedding thankfully i also had mom take a picture of the hairdo on the day of the wedding i sat down in the chair and about  mins later was shown a strange version of a plastered jackieo french twist or somethingit was nothing like the test run style and nothing like what i had requested i was shooed away to get my make up done and while that was happening i was told that if i wanted my hair fixed the way i wanted it i would have to pay another  for another appointment i was spending about  that day at the salon and i was the bride and i had already spent  for a trial run that was apparently worthless it was one of the worst customer service experiences ive ever had and it was happening right before i was getting married the guy eventually tried to fix it but my hair was already plastered with too much hairspray and he was acting like i was being completely irrational just because i didnt like his artistic vision i showed him the pictures of what he did before and what my other salon had done and crabbily pulled my hair back in a hair band and stuck some pins in it i will add that the makeup girl was great very nice and did a great job but the stylistsmanagement did make any effort to be nice to me and it was way too much money for what i got id try somewhere else if i ever needed a do in the burgh|zero stars  today my friend in a wheelchair came in and his friends wanted to sit at the bar for a slice  they asked if there was an exception to the rule about being at the bar  the manager told my friend that he could not be accommodated  thats illegal and immoral and absolutely disgusting|done with this place  it seems every time we go there they get slower and slower  today we waited  minutes for a cheese pizza that we never got before walking out  i complain to the guy making pizzas and he says youre not the only ones here well he secured the fact that i will never be back again|rumor has it that the pizza is good here but when i saw the prices i decided against it instead i thought id get the calzone  cheese toppings tucked inside a delicious bread pocket well making it vegetarian friendly was financially impossible i went out on a limb and asked if they could omit the ham and replace it with some veggies no they said that each vegetable would be  each yikes with that said i opted out of the calzone i went with the menu described fresh sliced zucchini truth be told it was obviously frozen prepackaged distribution center zucchini i wish i would have gone with the pizza but based on the service and quality of food i ordered i wont be back|the salon is so dirty we left before i let them cut me hair the sanitizers were old and half full the scissors and combs were a mess  httpwwwwellbuzzcomdrozbeautydrozpedicurebacterialinfectionsdrypedicurehaircutringworm|horrible service and the food is not comparable to any other ruth chris i have been to and ive been to them in  different cities my ribeye was all fat and the waitress was so snotty we wanted to throw our drinks at her save your money this place doesnt deserve to be named ruth chris ive had better steaks at the outback steakhouse|this place is horrible the cobblers do not know what theyre doing you can get better service elsewhere for cheaperi came to this place to get my dress shoes tapped and have rubber protection pads applied on the front half there are logos on the bottom of the shoes and i told the cobbler to not cover the logos the cobbler kept saying that he knew exactly what he was doing in the end i found out that he ground down half of the logo on one of the shoes and covered it with the rubber protection also he smeared the black glue used to apply the rubber protection pads all over the bottom of my shoes|id like to echo the advice of another commenter do not prepayi dropped off a pair of boots for salt removal new heels and a polish i was very specific about the polish because i wanted them to look nice when i picked up my boots i noticed that they looked very dull and there was still clumps of wax on them when i pointed this out to the clerk she took them back to the gentleman in the back the owner i think he said that the wax hadnt been buffed off he gave them a quick polish and took  off the price if he had then returned the boots to me freshly polished and shiny that would have been the end of it the problem was he gave them a  halfassed shine after sitting for  days with dried wax on them a quick polish didnt remove much the dullness  when i pointed this out to the gentleman he said he had done the best he could quite frankly  if thats the best he can do he shouldnt be in shoe repair i finally just gave up trying to make him understand why i was unhappy because it was clear he wasnt going to help me and he was becoming rude and unprofessional i had made the mistake of prepaying he had my money and had no more use for me i think if i had owed him money he would have taken my concerns more seriously instead of becoming increasingly snarky and mean i wish that i had paid closer attention to the other negative review about ullirchs on yelp which also includes pictures because it closely mirrors my own experience both in terms of workmanship and customer service the gentleman who owns the shop is sugar and spice when hes taking your money if you foolishly prepay but quite unpleasant if you dare to complain about shoddy work personally i dont mind if people make a mistake as long as they own up to it and correct it its when youre abusive about your own error that i take offenseif you do chose ullirchs do not prepay|short story the guy smeared the sole rubber all over the shaft of my boots said he didnt do it tried to clean it up and took out some of the leathers dye instead and didnt give me a refund id already paid  moral the story if you risk this dude only pay him at the end after you check for damages  long story belowoh groupon youve steered me wrong yet again  i have awful luck with service at places were ive used groupons overallhey you put out a groupon to bring in customers not to be pissed when said customers show up for their discounts basically i think the cobbler screwed me because he was only making  for  worth of servicesi dropped off two pairs of leather riding boots to get new heels  i had called and been given a quote of  a pair and was told that they still do same day service  id had a bad feeling about the place after i called for the quote and the guy i talked to the didnt know what riding boots looked likehe thought they had a spiked heelbut i had that magical groupon to use so i went anywayso i went  after some haggling and after seeing i had a groupon the cobbler told me that my soles were bald tires and he had to replace those as well  so now were up to  a pair  i said fine because i love these boots and they were quite expensive  i was told to come back after pmthree hours later i return  the cobbler finishes one boot immediately and hands it to me to look at  im pleased and say so  i pay  id brought my own canvas tote so i start packing up the boots as they are done one by one  and then i see it appearing on the remaining three bootsthe brownishblack rubber from the soles is fingerprinted all over boots shaft  oh hell no  heres the playbyplayme uhhhh i dont think this was on the boots before  points to blobsfront counter lady i dont know but you dont understand the process  its not possible for that to happencobbler not even looking  nope i didnt do that  that must have been there  looks like hair stuffme what um im pretty positive it wasnt there  get out my phone for the photo i took of the boots before dropping them offc nope wasnt me but let me see if i can get it offfcl begins rant about how people are never pleased etcme if you look at the shaft where it hits the sole you can see that there are smears and splatters right there  so it was not like thisc what do you expect for same day serviceme now fuming  for you not to damage my boots that im paying you to repairflc and c talking over each other alternatively making excuses about no one else offers same day and blaming me somehow for the shoddy workc grabs another boot to clean off and i see that whatever hes using is making it worse by taking off the dyeme just please give me that back  i already paid and i dont want you to clean them anymorec you really should buy a desalting and waterproofing treatment if youre going to wear them in the snowme i dont wear them in the snow  please just give me the boot so i can leavec okay baby  have a nice day babydont advertise whileuwait if youre going to gripe and do a terrible jobwhat would have made me happy you ask  if the cobbler had admitted maybe he had made a mistake voided the  dollar charge the other  was the groupon and offered to clean them properly for free  i would have even agreed to run the  charge again after hed restored the boot shafts  but instead he was a total jerkadditionally the woman working the counter had no clue about prices and had random friends using up all of the chairs for customers both times i was there  and both times she ignored me for a good two minutes before screeching you need something  rudefyi previously both my mom and i had repairs at ullrichs back when the older calabrese gent was working and they were at the old location  the repairs were about  cheaper and the service was excellent  honestly i think my family started going here because of the italian owner im a quarter calabrese myself but i wont ever go backresults after applying a leather cleaning solution and using a leather shoe brusheraser some of the marks are up but the rest appear to be permanent  this is after  hours of scrubbing  ugh  pictures are posted of the damage for your viewing pleasure|food was okay but was very surprised that they have absolutely no handicapped accessibility steps to get in from the street restrooms up the stairs to nd floor no accessible stalls in restrooms surprising in this day  not handicapped accessible|based on the awful service i received the last three times i dined here i will never ever come back to this restaurantand it is a real shame bc i really wanted to like this placestrike  and the biggest offense light up night  i called for reservations but was hung up on and told we didnt need them  my party of  arrived at ish expecting a packed restaurant but the place was empty  we asked for a table and were told due to the amount of reservations it was going to be an hour  i get thatbut the place was empty  the host was not gracious about this instead he seemed frazzled and bothered by our being therewe sat at the super cool looking bar and ordered drinks and asked if we could order appetizers to the bar  the bartender who was a complete dick said i have a full house tonight im not going to take food orders at the bar  id like to mention this guy is apparently the bar tender at the papa js in carnegienot the regular bartender who is awesomethe place is empty  we order drinks  and we wait and we wait and we wait  all the while we can see empty tables and i kept thinkingyou knowif you had just sat us we would have been out of here by now  so i asked the bartender who was helping the host  why cant you just seat us since the place is empty its been an hour and we just want to know when you think we might get seated  we would have left but honestly we were invested with our time at this point  the bartender said well for all the people who could take the time to make a reservation we hold a table for them  wellyikes  if this is how you act no wonder your restaurant has been dead every single other time we have been therewhen we finally were sat we were seated in a tiny table wedged in a room with a huge party that was three sets of parents and like their  screaming children  it was such a nightmareturns out they had the regular bartender waiting tables that night and he felt so bad about our wait and where we got seated he took one of the entrees off the bill  so that was cool but not enough to make up for his moron coworkerstrike   if you go there for lunch and you order a hamburger expect the waitress to give you attitude if you ask for cheese  yeah if you didnt know this was an italian restaurant and we only have mozzerella  really  i didnt know hamburgers were traditional italian fare  i wouldnt have been that upset but my hamburgerwhich was burnt flavorless and tasted like freezer burn along with my diet coke came to   for a burger  and a coke  the prices here can be ridiculousstrike   empty restaurant  i mean empty  my friend and i are there and we had bread wiith our meals  our thing of olive oil was empty and there was a full thing of olive oil on the table next to ours  no one else in the same dining room  i took the olive oil off the table next to ours  our waitress came over and was like maam this is not a free for all you cant just take things from the tables if you need something you have to ask  wtf  there was no one there and it was just olive oil and also had she been attentive i wouldnt have needed to take the olive oil  she would have brought us a full oneso ive tried this place  times and that was enough  i dont know how it remains open but i suspect it will close soon  not worth the attitude of the staff  they dont seem to appreciate the few customers they do have which is a shame bc when i like a restaurant i recommend it and i bring my friends there|i will never complain about philly gay bars and clubs again after visiting pgh for a bit  i went searching for my ppl  that in itself was a chore when i finally found a bar it was not the most pleasant its this bar hole in the wall called images  at first i thought it would be a good experience but after my first drink i was over it the dring was so watered down that drinking water would hv had more of a kick i finished it   though although it was only  it could hv been better  the bar tender was not the friendliest either after my first drink i waited and waited and waited for him to notice me and inquiry of me if i wanted another which i did but after being ignored i decided to go  somewhere else if he didnt want my money im sure there are others that would be willing to take it so i left they say first impressions are the strongest and last lasting ones well my impression of this place was not good being from out of town i expected a bit more  but i guss thats asking for too much in all fairness  id give this place another chance to earn my business or never to come back on to the nx|the gelato counter was disappointing  the woman who served us told us that it was rated in the top  gelatos in the country and added that it was from philadelphia  isnt that the same as not made fresh in pittsburgh  when we asked if we could mix flavors she said that we couldnt do that because its too messy  what she should have said was that the portion would be too small to able to mix  she oh so carefully dipped less than a full scoop and dropped it in the cup  the gelato wasnt good enough to be short scooped even in a fancy chocolate shop in the strip district  maybe they figure that the tourists who stop there wont be coming back anyway  if you find yourself at mon aimee chocolat and want gelato leave immediately and go to mercurios on walnut st in shadyside   there youll find better gelato more flavors which you can mix and youll be served with a smile|i stopped by mon aimee because they carry a chocolate hazelnut wafer hanuta that myself and a few friends enjoy i decided to take a quick snap chat video of their other varieties to show some out of towners what they were missing out on as soon as i opened the app a woman very rudely stopped me and insisted i put my phone away or leave i understand they dont want any one to copy their style however that is not what pittsburgh is about there is no room for snobs like that in our city this is just my experience i have heard others say they were not very friendly which is very unfortunate because pittsburgh is so welcoming grandpa joes and sinful sweets are great alternatives|very rude staff they follow you around like the secret service watching every move you make please you are not there to help me carry a candy bar to the registerand on top of all of it you have a  minimum on credit and debit cards at a candy storeno thanks much better candy shops around the city|rude  especially if you have a kid with you they dont even want you in their store i went here a few months ago to get my little one a treat i must say their attitudes suck big time thats putting it nicely theres other ways i could describe them but it wouldnt be appropriate posting it on the internet they follow you around and every item you look at they jump at you like youre going to run off with out paying news flash if i didnt have money i wouldnt be in the store any way i couldnt figure out what their problem was it could be the possibility they dont like kids dont trust people who arent snobs like them or people that are like me with tattoos and piercings it very well could be all threeas the other reviews said there are way better candy stores in the area that welcome your business and will treat you with better customer service if zero stars was an option for reviews id give this place no stars  thank you for your horrible customer service i will never be back|theres nothing about this specific location that is bad  its the einstein bagels food itself  i got a santa fe egg wrap and i dont understand how they can use the term egg in the name  theres no way in hell that slimy yellow gelatin came from a chicken   absolutely horrible|could have bought it in a store hershey ice cream that had the crystaly signs of freezer burn  totally disinterested staff included a girl that was texting when we walked in and shouting into her cell phone when we walked out  no one gave us a bill and i had to interrupt the person at the cash register to get her to take my money  didnt even get a thanks with my changeso not worth the walk that we took to get here|this place is terrible i went for the first time on national ice cream day  and thought why not give them a try ugh the entire place needs to be gutted and renovated theres so much dead space missed opportunity and with the crowds chaos and disorganization skip it|i made an appointment  weeks in advance when i was texted after i lefta voicemail it took a couple days to schedule as the woman retta forgot her appointment book one of the days when i showed up to my surprise it is looks like it would be a closetright beside the elevator no window an office right next door that looks to take up most of the right side of the building i gave it the benefit of the doubt and tried to open the door to go inlocked okay i think its just one lady named retta so i waited since my appointment was at  and it was  around  i lightly knocked nothing i gave her a call and she didnt pick up at this point i really had to use the restroom i waited until  and knocked normally so that it would be heard i sent her a text touching base and asking for the bathroom code around  i knocked again  i called again and left her a voicemail letting her know id been waiting and would wait another  minutes before leaving and contacting amazon local for a refund i asked a few people if theyd ever been there and go the responses were all no a few people id run into on my way knew where it was as they pointed it out to me around  the same men came back around and one knocked very loudly for me and they found me the bathroom code thank god so i come back at  and knock one last time i left and have not heard from retta and it is now  ill be reaching out to amazon local for sure|id give it zero stars if i could worst customer service my husband made an innocent mistake and confused the weekends for our trip back to his home town we asked that we get the credit and offered to add a night to our stay the hotel would be out no money but these corporate suits refused so  theyve lost a customer  a platinum customer weve given marriott so much bloody money over the years but these greedy suits could care less a little goodwill would have cost them nothing where has good customer service gone truly pathetic and believe me  theres nothing special abt this hotel the william penn the doubletree and several other hotels are far far far superior get good rates on priceline heck  ill even give a shout out to the renaissance downtown  its not owned by the courtyard jerks good luck go steelers|when i checked in the front desk staff was missing  when i checked out the front desk staff was missing  the valets had to be chased down every single time i needed to park or retrieve the car  when i called a week later regarding the charges on my account the first call was disconnected  on the second call i was put on hold for ten minutes before i gave up  on the third call i asked the clerk to email me a copy of a form and she informed me that the scanner was down and she would be unable to for several daysthe pillows were appalling and there was no complimentary breakfast and no refrigeratordoes anybody run the show here  what a disgrace to the marriott name|literally worst service ive ever received at a hotel was using a conference room for multiple days and had to beg snooty staff to come refill waters and clean the room also policies like how much parking costs seem to change from visit to visit to sum up i cringe thinking ill ever have to speak to the people at the front desk again the location is amazing they have that going for them do not stay here you will be disappointed|this hotel is well located however the staff especially zac dont care a bit if you have elite status or not the staff is young the manager nowhere to be seen no upgrades room has high ceiling so what not personal at all strictly business restaurant no great shakes one of three the better restaurant is the little cafe across the street owned by same owner bellhop seen limited times to get a cab walk to the westin across the street or take a bus no hello on entering not friendly so why stay here not a  star really a  star point redemption way too high nothing to recommend stay at the westin across the street and kiss the staff there goodbye run dont walk away  not even the shuttle goes anywhere useful linda b august  will never stay again|do no stay here if you plan to sleep before  am they could not care less that there is a very loud bar directly across the street if loudness doesnt bother you than this place is fine|my wife wanted deli so we went here  boy was that a mistake her corned beef was brown and bad my lean pastrami was  okay a bit better than edible  my dad liked his salad  the kids liked their turkey and hot dog  so far two and a half stars the real reason for the single star was the cole slaw  it was off  as in spoiled  i had my salad eating father confirm the fact he had to spit it out  when i brought it to the counter and told them the guy was nice enough to offer me another side he then tossed the slaw without so much as a sniff i fear for subsequent patrons|yuck i have avoided this subway like the plague its too bad that this location is the most conveniently on the way to my job  i literally walk past this subway  times a week  even at pm its never packed there for lunch and the reason why is  because their sandwiches stink when i say gross i mean that the standards for food are as low as the standards for cleaning the attitude of the workers here is just pitiful the dont care about making a good sandwich nor do they care about keeping the place clean what a wreck as some one who eats at subway  times a week i feel entitled to my opinion avoid this subway|incredibly slow worst club ive ever hadhilite was the tortilla soup that was actually edible waiting  minutes for a cold club and cup of soup is totally unacceptable especially when we were the nd table seated of the day|i had previously reviewed the golden palace buffet stating that it was some of the worst chinese food ive had  well this place manages to be worse than itthe place is rather run down  the buffet was really terrible  food left to sit out in just its oil and a barely lit heat source  it just wasnt a great environment  try something else definitely|i treated my younger sister and kid brother out to dinner  to recognize their high pssa scores and over all academic success so far this school year  what can i say the kids just love this placefor me the food was terrible  i wouldnt even have cooked this way for an enemy i got the cabo shrimp salad this was four tiny dried up shrimp served in a bowl with ice berg lettuce an rotten tomatoes  the kiddies had beatlejuices which is grape juice and sprit with a gummy worms they also had oreo milk shakes which they demolished and said were super yummy each of them for dinner also had a cheese burger the burger was juicy and delicious i have to comment on th bathrooms they are in terrible shape the toilet paper rolls are broken so instead of fixing the toilet paper rolls max and ermas just sit the roll of toilet paper on top of the broken toilet roll i couldnt believe it|i cant tell you how bad this place is regretted not looking up on yelp for reviews before ordering for deliveryseriously this place has the worst chinese food ive had in my whole life|bad worst chinese food in pittsburgh|this is the worst chinese food ive had ever and pittsburgh has some pretty bad chinese places  the golden palace buffet is bad but at least edible  i am utterly baffled at how this place stays in business|dined in food had obviously been sitting out all day at the buffet lo mien was soggy and had unidentified black grit in it  broccoli was clearly unwashed whenever it was cooked finally i ordered beef with broccoli and the meat looked pale like chicken but tasted to gamey to be chicken or beef first time i ever wondered if i was being served cat|stopped in for a quick drink on new years eve about  pm  the place was empty  the bartender chris was rude and very vulger  he made a crude sexual comment as soon as we sat down  we decided to stay for a drink anyway  after going a couple of choices we were told the bar was out of most stock  on new years eve  the bartender kept complaining about his job and bosses for the next  minutes  we paid for our drinks and got up and left  might be the strangest employee experience i had in awhile |every time i come here hoping just hoping that im going to have a couple delicious hotdogs raw unfiltered old school like a ballpark from the s or somethingbut each time i come away disappointed even more than last timemy father worked here three or four decades ago id love to love this place and recommend it to my friendsthe service is anywhere from good to great and they are fast and friendlyand maybe just maybe i come when the hotdogs have been sitting on the grill too long at odd hours or an hour after the rushevery time the hotdogs and brats are harder than a rock  not a snappy casing no this is like barely edible hard exteriorso whats a man to do try again  sadly ill probably forget about my recent experiences and try them againi just hope they are fresher next time because i cant imagine them worse than today|i walked into sammys expecting a ny style corned beef sandwich and that is not what you get i dont think sammy has ever even had a good corned beef sandwich meat was dry under seasoned and luke warm the bread was just sliced supermarket bread i hate to say it but giant eagle makes a better sandwich than this place dont waste your time|rules made by men check them before you book this church to get married or any other event their restrictions are far beyond respect and more on the ridiculous side stay away from this church|it took over two hours for our lunch here and it wasnt even busy  when the food finally came it was bad  we never received an apology  the prices are cheap but its not worth it|the food was terrible i got the crab cakes and they were mostly bread crumbs two people at our table got the crab bisque and neither could take more than  spoonfuls it was a wednesday at  and the restaurant was completely empty besides our group we quickly found out why i would not recommend this place for food|mahoneys is the type of place where women are accosted by the bartender as my girlfriend was this evening dont go|after a work happy hour a few doors away several of us were looking for a place to eat and were having a hard time deciding i was the pain in the tukkhas since id driven my antique car and kind of needed to be able to park it where i could see it plus id really planned the evening to be a birthday dinner for one of the coworkers we decided to split up and me and the birthday girl go somewhere and the rest would hit something within walking distance then as birthday girl and i got to my car we realized we were parked in front of a restaurant and mahoneys won out by defaultwe should have gotten in the car and driven somewhere elsethe atmosphere was pleasant enough but the foodyeesheveryone placed their orders mostly sandwiches of one variety of another sided with fries plain or sweet potato or slaw i ordered the reuben hoping for the best but definitely not receiving itmichaels chicken breast with plain fries arrived with sweet potato fries and instead of just bringing him a side of regular fries they took the whole plate back to make the switch kims turkey rachel arrived and as it was handed in her direction half of the stuffing fell off the plate and onto the floor the server took the plate back to the kitchen so that rachel could be restuffed and for the rest of the evening her initial guts laid right there on the floor kim  had a fried fish sandwich which looked a little withered and then there was my reuben more like an ewwwwwwbenthe bread was dry as chalk and the corned beef had been so overdone it looked like bacon sticking out of the bread dry dry dryand i took maybe two bites of the slaw and that was quite enoughthe prices arent steep but seriously people take some pride in what youre handing off to a customer would you eat that seriously put that order down on the counter in front of youand take one minute to look at itthen make one exactly like it for yourself are you gonna eat that if not um why would we want to pay for itthe service was pleasant enough and the atmosphere was comfortable enough for nice conversation but would i go back nope the food my reason for going to a restaurant was dreckmy apologies to my coworkers for forcing them to try it along with me|terrible the food they brought us

chicagoriders beware this is  a nightmare and a completely unreliable mode of transportation norfolk southern owns these tracks unbeknownst to the lay traveler there has been delays both ways on this route for the past  to  months  freight cars get preference  mile stretch in indiana with only one track  delay was  hours going to chicago and over  hours coming back the staff are trying to do their job but seems like the situation is out of their control amtrak fails to let customers know realistic arrival time terrible experience i give it a f|small simple train station no red caps to help customers is a big downer  traffic getting out is horrendous also|this place was horrible did not even for a moment have a seat on the chairs while i waited to board the next train the walls were dirty nasty and dingy it smelled awful inside it was quite crowded and i just did not like my surroundingsand dont let me get started on the restroom after seeing the filth in here i decided to walk down the street at am in the freezing cold to the greyhound station nearby to use their facilitiesthere was absolutely no type of cafe or even little convenient store within this station to grab a bite to eat while you wait i did find a vending machine to get coffee but even that was watered down this place needs to be torn down and rebuilt from the bottom up i waited with my family down the street at a different station before we had to be back to board our train i will be sure to not have this place in any of my future stops not a good way to sell the cityhorriblethe only reason why i give this station  star is because the train itself was quite comfortable and clean|train was delayed by  hours but did not update until  minutes before arrival this continued for the total of  hours there is no wifi and only two outlets i decided to take the train because of the speed and comfort of walking around during my journey the cons outweighed the pros it would have probably been better to take the mega bus the washington dc train is on a performance standard which means it is constantly being checked for efficiency in time right now it is at   not good at all|unbelievably bad if the roach crawling up the wall doesnt scare you away the terrible fried rice will the egg rolls have only cabbage in them the chicken is dark fatty and inedible dont miss the  pound tub of msg as you walk in i paid for my food ate half my egg roll noticed the roach food was then delivered i took one look at it and threw it out and left you should skip this place for sure|did not enjoy my meal what so everthe staff was cold and the seating area was dirty the place was more of a hole in the wall then i can appreciate cheap but your getting what you pay for in quality|if a place downtown isnt busy at lunch time then either youre much more wise than the hundreds of thousands of professionals or the place stinks  fu lai is the later  the food was gross and i usually wouldnt say that about a place  my general tsos seemed to have been previously frozen and i think i got  gristle  i dont shriek at the sight of msg but this place uses a bit much  i got a whopping  pieces of wilted broccoli and  sliver of onion in my dish and the sauce ewww the sauce  not sure why i stepped into fu lai probably because i wanted some cheap chinese  never going back|i tried to give this place a chance despite its reviews its not worth it they were very quick food ordered and delivered in under  minutes the only thing is my lo mein noodles were way overcooked and didnt have one vegetable in them the noodles were very bland and almost chewy my boyfriends general tsos was less than subpar the egg rolls didnt even have shrimp in them next time ill listen to the reviews|this is by far the worst chinese food i have ever had we ordered general gso extra spicy and there was absolutely no taste to it there wasnt even sauce it was horrible the fried rice didnt have any vegetable in it and was so bland the egg roll wasnt even cooked and the cabbage was awful i called to complain and they hung up on me i would never recommend this place to anyone dont waste your time order from somewhere else|the chinese donuts are amazing but thats it i had general taos chicken w fried rice and the chicken wasnt chicken ill forever order the donuts but thats it|very displeased i use to go here years ago and they were friendly and the food was great i was in the area and ordered beef fried rice first of all i thought the place was closed because it was so dark looking inside  the lady at the counter was overall rude i dont know what her problem was she didnt smile she wasnt polite at all and overall acted as if i was bothering her while she was making my food i noticed a guy sitting on the floor with what looked like a bucket of chicken meat he was pulling pieces apart putting it back in the bucket and discarding whatever it was in the trash tin can next to him overall it looked unsanitary and gross i had a weird vibe to just ask for my money back and walk out but i figured id give them a chance she comes back with my food and puts it on the table for me to grab no thank you have a nice day or anything i looked in the bag no fortune cookie not even a utensil to eat with i asked for it and she again acted as if i was asking for too much whatever i get back to my location to grub and find little to no beef in my beef fried rice i literally counted  tiny small and thin pieces not even full strips the beef itself was tasteless and the rice alone was oily and nasty the fortune cookie itself was stale i never in my life had a stale fortune cookie before lol this place use to be awesome food use to be great the people were nice and friendly i dont know who is running the store now but they will never get a dime from me again ever i never in my life had to empty everything on a plate to see if there was even any meat in the food deuces|the preparation was fast and the price was very reasonable but it doesnt make up for the fact that everything had a bad weird taste and the food inevitably made us very sick afterwards we ordered for pick up and they forgot our drinks and plastic ware i will definitely never order from here again absolutely disgusting|they lost my clothes and charged me for stuff i never sentclearly they do not know what they are doing and need to get their act together|not only did they damage a sweater they told me they would take care of it with my tailor and never did  on top of that they write in permanent marker on your clothes unbelievable stay away from this place  take the time and take your clothes somewhere else|do not go here they staple your name to your clothes because they cant handle organizing your things even with that theyve lost my clothes before and now i just got a  sweater back from being dry cleaned and the loop to hold the tassel on is ripping off they are clearly incompetent not only that the place smells like an ashtray when you walk in how are your clothes even clean when they come from that awful|i used galardis for   months when i first moved to pittsburgh ive since changed cleaners i think galardi offers great service for pick up and deliver dry cleaning in the downtown area the owner is actually a nice lady but after nearly having  shirts ruined i decided enough was enough i think their delivery guy is a huge part of the problem i actually like the owner but i cant keep having my clothes messed up and not have anyone take responsibility for it i wish i could tell people to go here but i cant do it in good conscience|the restrooms looked like after an bombardment an improvised shack amid buckets of olives and spices highly questionable hygiene for a food storedisgusting i will not go back until they clean up the place its just filthy|have been going to the pennsylvania macaroni company for years love their fresh pasta and great selection of cheeses always great service however today was the exception rudest woman at the cheese counter then went to get the fresh pasta and the woman behind the counter was downright nasty she was covering the pasta at  they close at  and i asked her if it was to late to get pasta she rolled her eyes at me and said uh yeahwe are putting it away right now a simple yes or no would have been nice i said ok thanks anyway then she must have reconsidered and said well did you want something in a very rude voice needless to say i walked away wow pennsylvania macaroni company needs to work on customer service obviously she hates her job then get another one if i didnt drive so far to get there i wouldnt have written this review every january i buy  months worth of cheese for my family members i wont be doing that anymore|the staff at gateway made me feel like a customer at a used car lot they are pushy about selecting expensive unnecessary options and do not ask the customer which choices they want they simply write it down and then bill you i was told there would be a  charge for a digital retinal photograph which i consented to other than that i was not informed about which services were covered and which were not i was not given clarity or any explanation of services which were added to my bill without asking me for example antiglare and a lens warranty were added by the staff member automatically so i had to actually stop them and object to individual services which they then tried to convince me to get anyway i felt uncomfortable and pressured into services that i was never told the cost of until i was paying the bill at the front desk the cost was exorbitant and i was not at all prepared based on my conversations with staff it cost me over  after my insurance coverage which is quite good to get my glasses and contacts updated i am not planning to return to gateway for any future visits and i would never recommend it to others|what an embarrassment rottenblack  salad greens a server with a black eye pedestrian signature pasta plates and glasses left uncleared greasy scratchy plates at buffet all yours for  per person|what a disappointment when the water glass cracked in my hand as the server poured and soaked us we should have known it would be that kind of evening worst part of the meal was the pasta triothe limpest pastiest most tasteless mass of lukewarm pasta i have ever been served one waiter saved the day by insisting i reorder while everyone else in the joint was content to let us stew every aspect of the experience was substandard although when i reordered the beet salad was very good overall lidia should be ashamed to have her name on a place like that|lidia you should be ashamed this spot wouldnt have lasted a year in nyc citizens of pittsburgh dont be fooled lidias is average at best i ate here when it openeda and again  years later nothing has changed we did have some great bar nibbles quality cocktails and a good bottle of wine off of a pretty good list but the food and service lacked for starters we were served ice cold meatballs and limp soggy salads the took away everything and only brought back fresh salads mind you we were one of about  tables being served that evening the entrees were dull and lacked seasoning the servers were confused how many times does it take to ask fro fresh pepper and our waiter seemed to hand off our table to another server its tough to find anything good here just another poser|i had really high expectations for this place but the food was overpriced  bland my lasagna tasted like it was made by stouffers the service was excellent the food nothing great|ate at this resturant while on a business trip we chose lidias because of its excellent reputation in the downtown pittsburgh area i have to say i was pretty dissapointed by my overall experience at this resturant our food was just average nothing special i had the gnocchi and the salmon shared between the two of us the service was absolutely horrible our food took over an hour and half to come out and we were the only people in the entire resturant our waitress carrie was extremely rude and had a really bad attitude i would probably not come back|took my friends from out of town to lidia last night very disappointed i couldnt understand why people raving about it too much over charge and terrible food none of us could finish the meals cause they tasted so bad even we were very hungry our  waitress looked dirty and no teethsservices was ok not that great olive garden is away better than this place this was my first time and last time|terrible will never go backfrom toothless busers to pasta that tastes like a soup kitchen rewarmcalamari was not freshpasta trio had the worst sauce i have ever tastedi grew up with fresh tomato meat sauce and worked with chefs from italythis would have hit the garbage in less than a second if i handed this to them to serveseriously when you are attempting to show classdo not hire people that look like they just walked out of the trash bin toothless busers asking to remove dishes that i am eating is unacceptable|purchased a groupon so we could check it outunfortunately very disappointed  caesar salad was drowning in tart dressing pasta trio   out of the  was passable the bread was good and the wine included in the groupon deal was pretty good which  is pretty sad because im sure lidias had no hand in making either of the  things i didnt mind from the dinner  good groupon deal but terrible food  will not be back|horrible baby girl bought a groupon and we revisited after a about a  yr hiatus i dont remember it being this bad wettest limpest caesar salad i ever had couldnt finish half of it pasta trio was bizarre three disjointed pastas that fight each other in flavor are piled on your plate penne undercooked fettuccine flaccid only passable pasta was the pear  ricotta ravioli too rich though we were there for an hour and fifteen minutes two courses and it wasnt that busy waitress walked away two times while opening our bottle of wine crazy we got the tiramisu to go i couldnt deal with this place any more lighting is distracting felt like i was in a food court in the mall carpet was all jacked up looked like fraternity house carpet clientele was strangelots of sleeveless ts and baseball hats i didnt even see that the one time i was at the olive garden  staff was inattentive and bothered i was really looking forward to going as we love tangentially related restaurants babbo  esca never again|very over priced for what we got we got the pasta tasting menu  a plate no meat in any of the  pastas not very tasty they were impressed with themselves that  of the  pastas were made onsite and other one was imported but that doesnt matter at all if the dishes they include are not rich and tasty and creative this was truly on par with olive garden all you can eat pasta for  same all you can eat same not much meat or veggies included same small dessert same service not same price|my husband and i opted to go to lidias for restaurant week since he had never been before ive been there for brunch in the past and had good meals so i thought itd be a nice place to take my italian hubby we both selected the prix fix menu with wine pairings    it was apparent when we sat down that they were understaffed the hostess began taking our drink order because our waitress was busy when the waitress finally got to our table we told her that we wanted to do the wine pairing and she offered us a few tasting options they had a decent wine selection and both her recommendations were deliciouswe both started our meals with caesar salads the salads came out and the plates were a little sloppy in appearance they were overdressed and way too big for a starter salad and the croutons were soggy as if they had been sitting in the dressing for a while at this point we hadnt seen our waitress in a long time maybe  minutes had gone by and we were nearly done with our salads before the wines camefor the main course i selected the gnocchi and grilled sausage the sausage was made inhouse and was very flavorful the gnocchi however was so burnt it was like eating dehydrated crunchy noodles with a dense chewy inside very unappetizing and i was unable to continue eatingmy husband had the pasta trio which is a tableside serving of three different pastas the first was a spiral noodle in red tomato sauce which was good the pasta was cooked al dente and the sauce wasnt too sweet the second pasta was gnocchi in a sage cream sauce also good the third pasta was supposed to be linguine in a mushroom sauce but the noodles were extremely undercooked some of them still clumped together at one end and there wasnt any sauce in the pan even the server commented on the lack of a sauce it was inedibleagain our waitress was gone for a long time and one of the nearby servers noticed that we werent eating our meals and we were actively searching for our waitress he came over to our table and we explained the situation he was really nice and immediately went to find the manager to get it fixed in the meantime our waitress did stop by and we explained again to her she also went to find the manager the manager came over to our table almost immediately she was very kind and apologetic indicating they were having a very bad day in the kitchen she offered us new plates of food but at this point we werent very hungry and still hadnt eaten dessert the manager offered to pay for our meals and dessert i had a nutella tart and my husband had tiramisu both yummy but too large to finishbefore leaving our waitress told us we should come back especially after they had plans to remodel in the near future not sure that we will after this experience|after watching lidias kitchen i thought id try it even though i heard it was pricy it was not like the lidias program on wqed i think lidia grandma would be appalled i had a salad with a red wine vinegarevoo dressing on request someone in kitchen in charge of salads dont know how to make a proper easy dressing i am a retired sous chef  yrs retired at a resort hotel in miami beach so i was appalled by a lousy not fresh dirty salad yes dirty the endive had the bottom cores on them and wasnt washed properly the veggies tomatoes were gross and the dressing was mixed oil vinegar only no herbs i pushed it away ugh then i had the gnocchi my mom used to make from scratch  this wasnt that this was the frozen gnocchi i in supermarkets they were all the same size and the taste was that you find in a store not fresh made dont be fooled it came w duck ragu that was ice cold they must of forgot to heat it up desert time well i was still very hungry order coffee and tiramisu was a old soggy mess last piece in fridge seemed like i hate olive garden but lidias made that good next time want italian nice prices go to alexanders in bloomfield all their pastas made to order in kitchen it says on their menu may take   extra minutes to prepare since they make them to order try their calamari over angel hair yum until lidias comes here and inspects  teaches that staff how to cook her recipes they are not what she makes on tv i made her recipes and they were really great this was simply gross high priced too i went by access so didnt have to pay  valet parking fee|this place is pretty poor and really needs to get its act together because its a disgraceful place to watch football especially given the accessibility of technology these days  first off it is desperately in need of some updates  there are old crappy projector screens and a few big rear projection tvs but not an hdtv in sight  there are tvs aplenty but they just feel dinghy and outdated and the reception on every tv is snowythe biggest issue however is that apparently theyre only able to show  games at any  time throughout the huge bar area  there are several main bar islands booths and pub tables all over with individual tv screens at each booth  sounds good but what good are all these seats if you can only show  games  that is absurd when you consider how huge sports rock is especially during college football  i went to watch a game that was on regular old espn and they werent showing the game  you mean i could go to my hotel to watch the game but am unable to watch it at a sports bar  give me a breakfood is also generally terrible  nachos are no better than what you can get at  and sandwiches have no flavor  and service is piss poor and understaffed  im not sure if they recently changed ownership or what but something was very very off here and they were obviously unprepared for the start of the football seasoni feel bad because the people were very nice and apologetic but that does not take away from the fact that even if they were showing my game i think id still rather watch it in my hotel room|i think that typically sports bars are really not expected to have good food  they just need to have four things espn nachos pilled high with all kinds of stuff beer specials big screen tvswell sports rock failed on all accounts  i was encouraged when we walked in and saw individual tvs on each table  of course we picked the one that didnt work  then we realized while there were many out of market games the virginia tech one was nowhere to be seen so we politely ask for espn  not espn u or  or anything fancy  plain old regular espn  then we get some story about how they only have six recievers  thats fine  but why am i watching the maineiowa game  seriously  i was also annoyed that when the cute girl walked up to the bar he had the georgia game on within minutes the nachos were absolutely disgusting and my wrap just leaked oil and disgustingness   the fries were even terrible but i found if you dipped them in the gross nacho cheese they weren that bad   plus beer was   multiply that by a  hour game and youre paying a lot  service was awful and i think i would get better reception on a tv with rabbit ears  overall this place sucked although i will give them credit as we were finally getting up to leave and go to an irish bar that was able to show espn i noticed the hokie game all the way back in the corner  took them long enoughif youre ever in pittsburgh in need of watching espn heres my idea  grab a permanti brothers sandwich and a six pack of beer and watch it in your hotel room rather than waste your money to sit and watch maine vs iowa on a crappy little tv with no reception|after ordering from here my credit card number was stolen since this was the only place i had used it in a number of weeks i can only assume it was stolen by someone here not a savvy business practice|too oily  i felt like im eating pure fat  even the bread is covered with oil  i suggest they make it healthier with more whole wheat option grape leaves are very dry and tasteless oh and their fries are terrible|came here on a sunday it was slow and we got our food in good timeordered two personal size pizzas spicy fries fried zucchini  onion rings the pizzas were actually really good but the other sides werent worth it tastes plain  over cooked ok so the reason why im giving this place  star is because i saw soooo many health code violations  a redbull can on the pizza dressing table the woman who charged me was working on a pizza and didnt even wash her hands after she charged me she just went right back to working on making the pizza  the same woman who charged me not kidding her nails were long  yellow mind you she wasnt wearing any gloves while putting that pizza together yuck  same chick went out for a cigarette break in the front of the place and when she was coming back in she brought and blew the smoke inside the restaurant price range in yelp language is i definitely wont go back because if thats what i was able to witness in the front of the place i dont want to imagine whats going on in the back i dont think im being harsh that was one too many violations in my opinion|is sad because the pizza is great but the service is horrible we place an order at  am for  extra large pizzas and  small the girl said about  min to an  hr great perfect timing in order to feed my staff at lunch when the girl repeated the phone number back i realized that this was the general number and asked if she could take my direct dial that way they would actually reach someone when the called to notify me that the delivery was in the lobby she repeated it back and i thought all was well i called back at  and asked if my order had left yet and all i was asked was what was the address ah hello were in downtown and did you ever think there might be more than one order coming in from the same office bldg a rd phone call was made closer to  pm to ask what was the hold up only to find out that my order was attempted to be delivered around  am but they couldnt reach anyone so they left when asked what number they were trying they said the general number yes the same number i advised the girl taking the order that she wouldnt reach anyone at the manager offered to remake the order since it had been sitting and offered a  discount on my next order wow thanks so after about  minutes the order still wasnt here so we called yet again only to be told were trying to call but no one is answering and that the driver was in the lobby needless to say they had all the right numbers but not in the correct order not only did we give them a direct dial at the beginning of the orderafter all the confusion and speaking with the manager we then gave a cell number just to be sure the call wouldnt be missed it seems the staff at ephesus needs to take an effective listening class maybe itll help when we told them this was the worst service weve ever received and that we would not be ordering again the simple response was ok|delivery horrible experience we waited over  hours for the food to be delivered the owner had no idea when the food was dispatched or when the food was made she promptly explained that the internet was down however the grubhub notification indicated otherwise the owner essentially lied about the delivery|crooks they overcharge you on grubhub with increase price stay away dont try these crooks food is terrible so is customer service there are better restaurants in pittsburgh this is piss poor excuse for a turkish restaurant|i ordered the boneless wins with garlic sauce and they were terribly hard as well as salty delivery was fine but the food was terrible never ordering from them again|i ordered  pizzas a gyro and fries for a special recognition for one of my coworkers we chose this restaurant because of the ratings and wanting to try something new i ordered through grub hub the order was to include a free cheesy bread and two litre drinks there was a spot to leave instructions i asked that the pizzas be cut into squares they show it this way in a photo and for one of the drinks to be diet after not receiving the food for  minutes past the promised time i called i spoke politely asking when my food would be delivered and was hung up on i called back in  minute increments each time being given a different excuse they could not get ahold of the driver there was traffic i explained that this was for a celebration and if they would just let me know so that if it wasnt coming i could order from another restaurant they finally agreed to cancel the order this was more than  hours after i had placed the order as soon as i hung up the phone the food was delivered i did not receive the free cheesy bread and the drink order was incorrect the pizza was not sliced into squares and i did not receive any french fries i sent s message to grub hub and they said they talked to the establishment and there is nothing they can do about it i would be careful ordering food here the service was very poor|okay so ive heard a lot of good things about this place and i wanted to like itbut it was seriously bad i very rarely eat somewhere and dont finish my food simply because i dont like it but i couldnt eat it i got the shadyside and it was super greasy and the flavor just wasnt there my roommate got the portabella and she wasnt feelin it eitherthe guy who served us was cool beans though|i received  hoagies halfassed crap from peppis in the strip from my friends daughters dance fundraiser just the other day  i paid  each for small  or so  smushed bread hardly any meat and wilted lettuce hoagies  are you kidding me  what a rip offi have ordered hoagies from all over the place for these types of fundraiser functions as well as sold hoagies for years as a child these hoagies are the most pathetic hoagies ive ever seen or eaten  you should be embarrassed and ashamed to even be selling these  what a joke  i will never be purchasing or eating from peppis ever again  horrible|good food worth waiting and waiting and waiting for  now wait  wait for the check|the absolute loudest hotel ive stayed at in a long long time paper thin wall  poor booking practices ended us up in the middle of the most obnoxious wedding party ever drunk bride hotel room parties until am and an apparent lack of security to monitor anything going on in this hotel have lead to this rave early saturday morning and i do mean rave quite literally review and yes this was after the front desk was called several times with noise complaints my best tip would be to not stay here unless the purpose of your stay is to not sleep|as our two day stay progresses the rating dropsbuilding  impressive entry great lobby  seems like a hotel of a bygone erabutvalet is a mess  located on a two lane street with no pulloff one must be lucky or patient to be able to pull up to the curb  we came in on a busy friday but i knew it would be busy its a summer weekend so why are there not more valetsas i returned both friday and saturday  i had to park the car exit and stand there waiting for someone to take my keys   friday it was about five minutes i had to make sure i locked it myself since the valet simply came and took my keys and stuck them on the rack  i had to point my car to him  didnt really trust what was happening among the chaos  saturday upon return  there was no valet in sight  i parked exited waited and waited and waited  finally a guy comes running across the street and nearly snatched the keys from my hand as if i was keeping him from taking my keys  checkin i mingled in with a wedding party and other weekenders  again a busy weekend summer weekend and a wedding and pirates in town yet only two desks are working for checkin the third was off with the wedding planner  took about  minutes to get to the desk and two minute checkin   i understand the big wedding but were paying guests toothe room was huge  king bed nice sized bathroom  but very very cold  no matter the setting it remained freezingif you request a river view be prepared and forewarned  we were neither  river view means stadium view and with a game going on means lights noise from departing crowed and that loud obnoxious socalled music from the plastic bucketbanging guy the pirate santa and some other keyboard playing dude all trying to get a few bucks from the departing crowd until well after  pmyes for some  is not late  however we rise with the sun for work during the week so we do the same all weekend  did i mention the noise from the ballroom right below us  party friday night wedding reception saturday night  at least friday the noise abated about  pm  saturday its  and the party still thumping right below us  picture that annoying bass thumping car that you drive by but instead it cruises right with you  all nightcouldnt really enjoy watching a movie reading has been a challengecalled desk manager who said the party was supposed to have ended at  pm and he was going to check on it  thirty minutes later nothing  he said hed adjust our rate  he said he didnt understand our room placement and blamed being busy as a reason we were stuck in this room  i understand theres an expected level of noise and light in a city but had there been any indication of such id have been sure to request a room on a higher floor and away from the river  no notes on the room selection and not even a mention at checkin  i guess being sold out some guests get screwed  of course by the time we figure it out we cant request another room since were in bed already and the hotel seems sold out soooooh that wedding  in the main lobby saturday afternoon  so that beautiful lobby that might have been a joy to sit in and read and enjoy a coffee  off limits  mostly im annoyed by room selection  a peaceful relaxing stay it isnt    for the rate we are paying i expected a much more comfortable and relaxing stay  i will not stay here again beware and be warnedupdate   the reception ended at  pm  night manager adjusted our rate and comped a day of valet  acceptable but wont risk those issues again at the rate they charge|the hotel is trying to claim a stain was found in the room and have charged my credit card  with no notification which i later found out they do have to send a notification to the customer i called the general manager who said he would call back in  hours ten days later i had to call him terrible service by the man who runs the hotel i would never stay there again because of the lack of professionalism|
