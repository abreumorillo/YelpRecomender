i stopped in here on a whim while looking for something extra to add to a gift  fun little things that remind you of childhood crammed in to this neighborhood corner shop  the woman working the store seemed to be the owner and several customers knew her by name  she certainly wasnt impressed with my measly two dollar purchase and after a huff of disappointment while disdainfully ringing me up she promptly moved on to someone eyeing a larger item on a higher shelf and i promptly moved on to another shop  i mean i understand you dont care about  dollars  but keep in mind i chose to give you my money and time|i will never eat here my family and i just tried to order food to go on christmas eve an hour and a half before closing and we were rudely turned away first we called to see if they

regarding papago crossings noting that a large majority of the reviews were negative someone who chooses not to believe everything that i read on the internet i signed a lease primarily because i was new to the area with very little knowledge on the parking with all of my belongs in a uhaul and no place else to go i have been a resident of papago crossings since  and i have found all of the negative comments that i read to be true so lets go down the list on the first day as i was moving in i walked into the kitchen glancing into the kitchen sink i saw roaches reporting this to the office i was told that the exterminator came on mondays and i would have to wait until then for the unit to be sprayed i moved in on a wednesday i was also told that the apartment had been empty for a while and the roaches where sewer roaches ive lived in dwellings before this is the first time that i have heard of such after raising a stink the exterminator came the next day still having the problem i returned to the office and was told that a new exterminator had been hired and received notice that my apartment would be fogged on monday december st i dont believe that happened and i still have roaches  the water in kitchen and bathroom sinks run luke warm at best and now luke warm is the best that i get from the bathroom shower too  moving on to the security of the property it was my understanding that papago crossings is a gated community which led me to believe it was a secure property there are gates but no good if they dont work the gates have only worked properly consecutively for maybe days at tops since ive been here one morning leaving for work at  am i was confronted by a man who appeared to be homeless two days later there was another with a grocery cart with trash bags tied to the cart standing on the parking lot i watched as he begun going through the trash bin as i drove away even the gates that require keys for entry are not secure because the locks dont work no code or key requiredas i read the recent postings i do see responses from management with a number to calli call only to get the message we are in the office but cant answer your call blah blah same complaints by different people|do not go to this vet trust me  find another one  unfriendly surely staff who think you are doing them a favor all the staff have lost their smile

sales a couple of times never purchased a vehicle herei maintain my own vehicles  i have had many positive experiences purchasing parts retail at other dealerships and parts suppliers over the years but never at this dealership  for ford parts i prefer sanderson ford but have used bell ford in a pinch on several occasions because they are a little closer to home  no more  their inventory and availability is poor  almost always have to order out anything but accessories or parts for a very late model vehicle  their counter techs are not knowledgeable i have often had to show them on schematics some i have printed myself because they couldnt locate the parts i needed or provided the wrong parts  they are interested in the quick highdollar sale and do the absolute minimum to track down parts or help a customer outjust got treated rudely by a counter tech who didnt have my part didnt want to order it and wasnt interested in helping a diyer out strike  bell ford|i would give this company a negative  stars if i could their customer service billing retention and supervisors do not care what so ever about customer service their tone and customer care is pretty much the worst ive experienced beware of this company they will steal your money and deceive you with promotions they wait for your promotion to end and have you forget to call in for another promotion and jack up your

the music they have progressively gotten more and more like a rock concert some people may like that i prefer a little more traditionalhumble music in church dont get me wrong my favorite band is system of a down i really do enjoy hard music i attended the christmas eve service and after watching a lip sync battle my family and i walked out i get that they have to appeal to a changing

provided me an experience equal to that of what i would expect out of a shack the guy who took my order was rude rushed me and didnt care to try to explain or recommend anything i was here at a time when nobody else was there so i wasnt holding up a long line or anything to just try something i went with the carne asada burrito this is a burrito that is really hard to mess up but somehow they managed to the menu is full of options making it hard to direct anyone to what is specialty the building itself is pretty cool once inside though was cool to try out but havent returned since and dont plan to|i was treated so rudely here by the doctor during my appointment and an employee who i asked to adjust my glasses while i was thereduring my eye exam i couldnt get two words in without being immediately interrupted by the doctor who also repeatedly asked me if i have any questions because all this information must be confusing it really isnt and that is terribly condescending ive been nearsighted for  years i get exams every year and i understand whats going on at this point he actually explained to me at length what nearsightedness is and how i can tell if i am at some point i just stopped responding and let him talk until he got tired since he obviously just wanted someone to lecture for a while i just needed an eye exam and a prescription not a series of condescending lessons including why i shouldnt sleep in my contacts i dont  but he didnt ask so he wouldnt knowthe employee adjusting my glasses made sure i knew how low quality they are and repeated it several times even though i replied i know they are not nice i dont make a lot of money i finally left with my glasses unadjusted  he seemed to believe he was incapable of adjusting my basic plastic glasses which ive had adjusted twice without complaint or lecture at much nicer placesi could not believe the way they spoke to me and because of it i did not buy contacts or glasses with them ill take my business elsewhere and im extra sorry that my usual optician was booked up during my time in scottsdale so i was stuck with this place|terrible service i literally have never been treated so horribly our blonde waitress was in no other words a total c honestly bob the manager was very nice but he gave us another waitress who was almost as terrible and before we even left our prev waitress had a gaggle of others talking smack about me and my table then had the nerve to mock us directly and hassle our table some more we were rushed our food and drinks were wrong and were told verbatim i have a table of seven so you need to order now if you want any food she scoffed any time we had to ask for our drinks to be refilled and trust me she never came back to our table so we had to ask we were then attempted to be paid off with a  by bob which was completely embarrassing we never received an apology never coming back|when i worked nearby over a dacade ago i and my coworkers frequented this place for lunch  it was really good then  about six months ago i ordered the mongolian beef  it had chunks of sugar in it  it was literally too sweet to eat much of it  the owner was there and said yes we put sugar in it  its not supposed to have that much though  she didnt seem to understand that it was sickeningly sweet and didnt much seem to care  they havent updated or remodeled since i used to go there and its pretty rundown now|very very disappointing order our holiday dinner got confirmation and all went to pick up and they were closed the lady said she didnt  know how the order went through after showing her the email confirmation all she said she can do is apologize now we have no dinner for christmas cant believe this i only ordered cause im  months pregnant what a mistake|this place assures that  you get diarrhea after every meal after i was done  waiting  in the extremely long line as i told the employee what i wanted they kept on making me repeat myself when i got to the first window they completely forgot my order once more i told them but when i was getting ready to pay i handed them my credit card and they said there machine was broken so i never got my meal i hope they do something about this|my car needed new engine mounts and wheel bearings i brought it in to honest one for a quote and the first thing they do is pull the car around to take a look at it then after they started looking at it they tell me it will be a  fee to look at it if i didnt get it repaired there but free if i did get it repaired there so they basically tried to trap me into getting the service done there nothing honest about that inspections should always be freethen their quote was  when goodyear was only charging  everyone says that small shops are cheaper than chains but not this one this one wanted to charge  more for the same work i wouldnt go here if i were you|i hate when anyone lies to your facei ordered a double whopper with cheese off the broiler because i want my food fresh not sitting in a steamer pani stood and watched him for about  mins pulling the meat out of the pan for all the ordershe didnt take mine off the broiler like i asked when i told the crew leader he ask the guy if it was off the broiler and he said they all come off the broiler i told him i watched him take it out of the pani dont like soggy meat|the service here has got to be the worst ever majority of the staff cannot speak english at all once in the door your going to be on a wait for the longest time at times you will get skipped and they will seat larger parties because of course the more heads the more money as your seated you will have a server rush up to you within a few short minutes trying to rush you for an order and if your not ready they wont came back for it for the longest time once ordered if you did order any soups such as pho than they will have it out within a few minutes because its the easiest to serve so half the table will have their food and the other half wont for a good wait after the food is dropped off you will not get any attention at all from the servers for refills or anything at all expect to constantly ask for whatever you need the pho is a hit or miss theres days that its okay other days its just flat out too oily very busy place  but way over hyped everyone talks about how good this place is but my personal opinion of the food here is obviously alright|the pho was okay but i had better this place was busy so i thought they would have amazing food but it was just okay the noodles were soggy and the broth wasnt hot our pho took awhile to come out and the service here is just not that good it was busy enough that the kitchen staff forgot one of our order and our waiter didnt seem really interested at all other than to bring us food honestly i wouldnt come here again|i understand this is a impound yard and all but these employees there should probably just kill themselves already i mean you dont have to fit stereotypes but its tough not to call a horse a horse rudest most uneducated idiots ive ever dealt with at this point i really dont care about the rental car thats in their lot im just so thankful that i grew up with an education and will never have to work at a scummy ass place like that i dont see anyone in that company making it pass a th grade education level|bought a round trip airport to hotel transfer going to the hotel the shuttle driver constantly kept mentioning that we needed to tip him he refused to let us get onto the bus without taking my small sized backpack and insisted on putting it into the back the reason that we didnt want him to take it was that there were plenty of fragile objects inside upon delivering us to the airport we saw that he had put many other passengers bags onto ours upon handing us my backpack he kept hold of one side and said that tips are important in vegas emphasizing that he needed a tip when we refused to give him one he mentioned that something bad will happen to us because we refused to tip him all in all terrible experience to the hotel coming back to the airport we ordered a shuttle through their automated service on the telephone  hours in advance the shuttle was ordered for  and we were outside at  as per request of the automated system at  we ordered uber as we needed to get to the airport the shuttle did not arrive on time or at all for all we know|cant believe it is two stars food is awful tasteless and not refresh dirty carpet mandatory tips worst|this place doesnt even deserve one star worst customer service very rude tiffany is an absolute idiot and omar might be the rudest person ive ever dealt with period im in customer service and these people were ridiculous i was made to pay for services that were never authorized nor completed because the tow company towed my car to the wrong place unfortunately i highly recommend the discount tire right next door those guys are professionals and gentleman they were super helpful and efficient |service was a joke drinks were weak food was ok but for the price i can go to fire rock for a cheaper meal with alcohol and a better service and environment was the worst time ever couldnt stand my waitress who was mia all night|so after leaving a negative review the store replies that my negative review is unnecessary  and they dont like that i stated their employees acted like bratty teenagers um yeah it is in fact necessary to leave a detailed review on yelp about your stores poor service thats what yelp is for i do give this place a big shout out for my proving my point when i stated their replys to negative reviews were juvenile and that they try dont take any responsibility for poor service and thanks for telling me your store as over  dresses on yelp since your sales associates couldnt be bothered while i was there also its cute you say i was contradictory that i said the store was crowed yet only had a few dresses your hole of business is filled with prom gowns so try again it can be crowded yet still have a poor selection of wedding gowns instead of trying to be rude a second time go back to grade school and learn how to form a coherent rebuttal ill skip the phone call to talk about it since youve already proved yourself a worthless business clearly the crappy attitudes go all the way up to management the reply to my one star review is beyond comical and borderline pathetic you dont want bad reviews dont give your potential customers a terrible experience rock on celebrations rock on|all the employees look depressed but who wouldnt be with that many customers to deal with working at minimum wage the lines are ridiculously long almost wanted to just drop my things and leave  as soon as i saw them|i would not trust this place with an important delivery they screwed up my wifes birthday surprise i called the day before and specifically said i needed a delivery for tomorrow and gave them the date and delivery window time for her to be home and receive her gift she waited all morning and they never showed up my wifes bday date has been the same since i met her  years ago however they insisted i gave them the wrong day the lady over the phone was rude and when i called to have them resolve she kept insisting i gave her the wrong date she even put me on hold and i heard her complaining to her driver about me as they were trying to get a delivery within the hour by that time it was too late i cancelled of course still in shock at how rude she was one thing i know for sure i am ten times smarter than the flower shop flunky that gave me such horrible service and i never forget my wifes bday date go elsewhere if reliability and customer service is important to you|this store is ok  i have seen other walgreens  they are all pretty much uniformly the same thing  i dont think they sell tobacco products at this one  which is the main reason i prefer this store over the cvs on the opposite corner of the intersection  use vigilance when driving to this store though because the lake mead  hollywood intersection is one of the worst intersections in this vicinity  second only to the mount hood  lake mead intersection  the past five years there have been too many accidents and fatalities here  remember to always look both ways and to keep checking your siderear view mirrors constantly  for some reason people really cant drive over here  this store us usually pretty well stocked  there is customer service  you just have to wait sometimes or go look for an associate who can help  many of the products they sell come and go all the time with the seasons so you just have to keep checking to see what they have every once in a while|this store use to fun and exciting to shop in i am out shopping on christmas eve of all days of the year i need a sparkly shirt for new years i am not paying old navy anything for that store to look the way it did when i walked in not that i could find anything anyways i dont care what day of the year it is no store should look like it hasnt been cleaned in months clothes were thrown all over the floors in every department i walked in and i know they have more than  people working there at any giving moment but a store doesnt have to look so flipping trashy the worst part is that not only did they downsize the whole store its been remodeled|from a first time perspective on italian cuisine the menu  could have used more detail andor images to help describe the entrees to first time visitors to carrabas like myself i tried to play it safe by ordering the obvious wood fired pizza and to my luck it was the wednesdays special the bad part is upon ordering our waitress told us the oven had been out of commission for  weeks im still wondering how a wood fired oven could be out of commission i quietly offered our waitress a way out by ordering the tuesday special after taking some time to look over the menu again but our waitress failed to get the hint no discount no apology no courtesy entree just a bad overall experience|sweet stylist but she completely ignored my photos and description of what i wanted and right here at christmas i have no hair at all this was a splurge for me and i was referred to her by someone who said the stylist was good with short hair i got a  cut miserable experience cute shop though and parking is easy|what a bunch of unfriendly snobs i drove nearly half an hour from madison to verona to buy yarn and needles after asking questions about specific yarns no one seemed to know i purchased yarn and chia goo needles one of which had a defective point i had to drive the half hour back to the store the next day to return the needles i had planned to swap them out until i found out that wisconsin craft market sells them for  less and the only thing that the sows ear snob cared about was that i did not return the top part of the packaging that allows the needles to hang on a hook for resale despite the fact that the needles clearly had to be returned to the manufacturer  im glad for the experience because i will never go back|i placed an order through deliverycom and waited  hours there was no contact to suggest that my order would not be received or fulfilled in fact i received  forms of confirmation when the food had not arrived in  hours i called the restaurant and was informed that delivery was not available nor had my food been prepared do not use deliverycom or order online if you hope to get your food i cannot comment on the quality of the food as i had to eat frozen pizza|went in for some last minute gifts great selection but the shady business owner pulled the cover off an album and changed the price right in front of me i hope that  extra you made up for the future business youre loosing|i wish i could give  stars i had a reservation the was marked payed in full when i arrived they wanted an extra  that i did not have they would not do a credit card over the phone or attempt to help me in anyway zak the agent was very rode and didnt see to understand they were leaving  my wife  kids and myself stranded in phoniex my relative had to drive  hours to hand me cash to resolve the issue only to be told they dont  accept cash luck for me a atm for my bank was located on site and i was able to deposit  the cash and finally complete my rental by  pm which was actually midnight to me due to the time difference sunny the supervisor was also very rude and tried to lecture me on being fiscally resposible i pay my bills on time and it cost me over a months salary to make my trip happen i will never use budget again and will be telling everyone to avoid this company the does not know the meaning of customer service|food was great service sucked waitress forgot about us and we had to wave down another one for a togo order which should have been placed a long time ago now we have to wait for  orders to be filled before ours and we have been sitting here done with our meal for  minutes oh and they forgot about our bread which is supposed to be included with our meal all we got was sorry|honestly if i could i would give this location  stars ever since they remodeled and got new management the service is terrible my husband and i stopped in on the way home for some food to go my husband ordered his food im standing next to him waiting to give my order when some woman comes walking out from the back office yelling something at the top of her lungs very unprofessional but whatever she comes up to the register and is trying to put cash into the register when she starts yelling at the waitress that people need seated mind you at this point she is directly in front of me on the other side of the counter i look at her and see her name tag says restaurant manager really this lady shes the manager anyway so im telling the waiter taking our order what i would like a moons over my hammy no ham but a veggie patty and the manager feels the need to loudly butt in thats not an option for substitution i try and explain that ive had it that way before she just refused to listen she continued to shout and is just flat out rude i said fine and we walked out i understand its busy and its christmas eve but there is absolutely no need for your rudeness instead of just yelling at people that things need done do them yourself instead of fighting with customers about how they want their food this isnt the first problem weve had with this location since the remodel and management change they have one really really good waitress who has worked their forever and we love but other than that i work in customer service and i know how people should be treated after long day at work all i wanted was some food|i went to  frys stores today looking for  ingredient for christmas dinner they close at  tonight so i had to hurry i arrived at this store at  pm and they refused to let me in saying they were closed they had a security guard standing outside denying entrance i needed  item arrived prior to the closing time and i was entrance|nice faculty and the staff was friendly everything was first class accept the golf course the course is loaded with blind shots if you play it all the time it might be ok if not it sucks nearly every green is higher than the fairway so you cannot see the surface on them either i do not hit it very high so the greens are nearly impossible to hold if you can hit themif you want to enjoy the sunset go to the th hole and save yourself  hours of frustrationi do not recommend this course|well where do i starton december nd  me and my  year old son alex decided to go shooting together  ben avery was closed on that tuesday so we drove all the way down from north phoenix to use the main range at rssc we used to live in mesa and i was a member of the rssc in  and shot multiple high power rifle w mike toliver and tuesday night steel matches i could say i was very familiar with the club and overall with the exception of grumpy range officers from time to time my experience was decentwe packed our guns and happy go lucky we went to the range we arrived approximately around pm and we proceeded to the main window to sign in range officer at the window reminded us to sign waivers and so we did and we paid  for both of us to go inafterwards we proceeded to the main range to get a bench and the guy in the counter called me back into the officehe started questioning me about my son and basically started interrogating me asking for proof that he was my son i was like  what you cant be serious what proof do you need he is my son lives at home with me and his mom i pay his health insurance and his room and board well sir i can see you have different last names i am ramirez he is smith and you have to prove legal guardianship before you shoot for a moment i thought i was in superior court in front of a judge instead of being at the gun club to give a little bit of background me and my son do not have the same last name me and his mom have been married for  years and she was a single mom when we met so she gave him her last name i raised the boy since he was  needless to say i am his legal guardian providing health insurance food shelter and the works i have never had to prove i am his guardian at any gun range or any other establishment for that matter is no ones business regardless seems intrusive and pointlessi got real irritated and told the guys at the office that what kind of establishment asks for proof what is this nazy germany die papieren bitte me and the boy have gone to ben avery caswells and the very same rssc before and never had any issues having to prove his my son the gave me the no ticket no laundry treatment and unless i could bust out some paper saying i am his legal guardian they would not let us use the range after the incident i asked for my money back and went and talked to the club manager bill and explained my disgust he basically told me his range officers had done nothing wrong and that asking for proof was a newer policy they had in the club i explained the same i did to the range officers and he said if i didnt have a paper from the court saying i was his legal guardian i could not shoot there he even told me what would you do if you get stopped by police with the boy in the car i was are you joking me what are police officers going to do call his mom whose at home he then proceeded to give me a bunch of waivers and told me to have them presigned by mom my wife so he could shoot there thenneedless to say we left i have never been more insulted in my life my boy didnt have a chance to shoot which was an early christmas present we went to ben avery the next day and it went smooth as butter no bull waivers no interrogation only dealt with professional and pleasant range officersrssc has lost my business forever|usually never have a bad experience here usually really nice girls but just recently there was incorrect and misleading signage which we asked the manager about tanya or tania dont remember the spelling and she was so rude about it and wouldnt even honor her own signage mistake totally embarrased and time consuming i wish she would have just honored the deal fixed her signage and not been the rudest little gremlin i hope i never run into her again|the front entrance was nice but the looks of the downstairs are very deceiving the elevator door was dirty the corridors smell badly and the rooms are identical to motel in details the bathroom smells of vinegar the room smells bad the first room we got has a view of pipes on a roof the second room was one floor higher and so the roof and pipes were below usthe desk tv stand and built in dont match and are scratched to some degree they are very outdatedthe beds do not appear as hilton quality but very blah the attendants downstairs were not friendly they were talking to each other and when we came it was as though we disturbed them there was no hello and a smile  dont recommend|to the administration of scottsdale healthcarehonor healthlast june my wife monika mccroskey suffered a hand injury and needed emergency medical care so we took her to the scottsdale healthcare osborn facility  it was determined that she would need hand surgery and we were told youre lucky one of the best hand surgeons in the valley is available and can perform your surgery today  that was somewhere just after noon that day  we were told his name was dr liu  we were given the initial impression that the operation would take place sometime that afternoon  over the next few hours monika was moved out of the emergency room and into a patient room in the hospital and eventually told that her operation would take place sometime later that evening  she was eventually wheeled into the operating room sometime around pm that night now we have our medical coverage with blue cross blue shield and were aware and i confirmed it when she checked in that scottsdale healthcare osborn was an in network facility   at no time were we informed that dr liu was not an innetwork provider    now i have laid out this time line to show a number of thingsfirst although this was an emergency room situation there was no immediate threat to life or her wellbeingsecond dr liu was not just immediately standing by and was probably not the only option available to usthird there was plenty of time for someone to inform us that dr lui was not an innetwork providerthe surgery went well and a week or so later my wife showed up to the arizona center for hand surgery for her follow up visit with dr liu it was at that time she was informed that liu and the arizona center for hand surgery were not a bcbs innetwork provider  and we have since determined it appears that they are not an innetwork provider for most if not all major healthcare providers  at that time monika was assured that it was not a big deal and that the center would do everything in their power to work with our healthcare providernow you know where this is going so lets cut to the chasebcbs has paid their standard and customary rates for the procedure to us and we have paid them to arizona center for hand surgery  we have support an appeal to bcbs but to no avail and been assured by the center along the way that they will work with us  the arizona center for hand surgery received the rejection of the appeal from bcbs and immediately has issued us a letter threatening to send our account to a collection agency of we do not pay the remaining balance  immediately although they have graciously agreed to knock  off if we immediately pay it in fullnow i have been in contact with someone in your organization regarding this and was informed that among all of the physicians who work in our facilities we cannot know who is an innetwork provider and who is noti get that but what you can do is just a little research on the internet and determine which ones out there seem to be scam artist  because after i did my research it certainly appears that that is exactly what dr liu and his arizona center for hand surgery are  there are over  reviews on the internet describing situations very similar to our situation  it appears that this is their standard operating procedure and you scottsdale healthcarehonor health are supporting their tactics by letting them operate in your hospitals  shame on younow i do not know what we can do to make this  charge go away but i do know that scottsdale healthcarehonor health can try to make more of an effort to not let these types of scams go on in your facilitynow what i can do is this  this letter will be blasted on all of the internet sites i can possibly find dealing with scottsdale healthcare and the arizona center for hand surgery  everyone out there needs to know what they are getting into when they show up to an emergency room and are directed toward a doctor involved with the arizona center for hand surgery| in the afternoon and theyre out of every single  bagel except two nasty gingerbread bagels then the one slow rude woman working there takes forever to wait on everyone as if she holds all in contempt never going there again|i normally dont write negative reviewshowever this company deserves to be acknowledged for in my opinion being dishonest i was told to bring my machine in and theyd take a look at it and give me an estimate i left my machine and received a call that itll be  for the estimate and  to repair they said i needed a pump that cost  i checked on the internet for the same pump and saw that it cost  the same pump labor is  hr  for  hrs to replace a pump off a pressure washer in my opinion they have lost that customer service honesty you somewhat felt before they moved into this newer place i no longer will do business with them and dont trust them any longer beware of the mark ups the fake smiles and fake concerns they tend to display to you see how much an estimate is and get it in writing before you leave your machine good luck|this is for the film lab they are with next door not in the actual tempe camera building but next door first off found them quite rude i had called earlier in the day and discussed film developing and pricing i told that to the woman working the front desk and she goes you called aaaaaanndddd in a rude tone i literally quietly chuckled because it was crazy how rude her tone was i develop my  film at a pro lab in utah and california normally as i am a full time film and wedding photographer i didnt have time to ship the film out and needed the scans right away so i had to use one locally in terms of scanning quality not great inconsistent from frame to frame which shouldnt happen that staggeringly considering most of the  rolls were shot with the exact same settings the sharpening setting was on the scanner is up completely too high way too sharp and very unflattering the color in the scans is way off sometimes way too yellow sometimes way too cyan i tried to fix the photos in lightroom mostly using exposure temperature and split toning to counteract their tones overall in image quality very poor price   for  rolls of film done in one day timeliness was not a factor but i paid twice the normal price to make that happen other big issue is the way they deliver the files they only offer them on a disc if you have an apple mac from the past four or so years you know that they dont have a disc drive the lady working suggested i buy a disc reader for my computer crazy so i had to go to an office supply store buy a usb and bring it back to them waited for them to develop and scan and then went back to pick up huge waste of time considering that every other pro lab delivers via dropbox wetransfer or ftp i am writing this review because i want them to make it i want this lab to survive because film is a beautiful and wonderful medium and i have made a living off of it for years so i would love to see nicer customer service that was an incredibly rude transaction and weirdly she was a lot nicer when i came to pick up the film must have picked up on my shocked facial expression  better scanning i heard they use frontier great noristu and frontier are what my normal lab offers but why was i not asked for a profile lightdark warmcold sharpness level etc all other pro labs offer a custom profile if they do do this that wasnt explained  a different delivery method she made the comment that it would be so expensive to do something like dropbox i would argue that itll cost you more not to in the long run because even if the scans were perfect i would never drop off and pick up a usbdisc every time big inconvenience i know multiple all film wedding photographers in the city who spend  a year on developing and scanning with out of town labs take that business back why arent they developing here the above issues are  why overall please make these changes and then let us know when you have we want you to make it|awful experience sat at the bar and waited several minutes before plates and glasses were removed from the previous customer and had to ask for the counter to be wiped clean for us took  minutes to get a drink and  minutes to get our foodwhich was served cold when we asked for the manager she came and removed the cold food we told her we didnt want anything else since the rest of our party had already finished eating when the bill arrived and we asked if there was anything else they could do to compensate us for our terrible time she argued with us we will never go back to this place the food is great but its a shame the management is so terrible|this is by far the slowest mcdonalds ever  its a shame too because its right outside of a military base|first problem i had here was my apartment wasnt ready for my family to move into so they had my family stay in a model never stay in a model nothing works second problem is we spend over  a month and we do not have an assigned parking spot we have had to park as far as  football fields away from our building when drug sales are brisk which isnt a big deal unless it is shopping day third problem is the appliances are outdated and breaking down my wife washes the dishes and puts them in the dishwasher which spreads the dish soap over everything but does not rinse them off maintenance has told me that they do not have any replacement dishwashers so he replaced my dishracks fourth problem i pay more here for power than i did in my house which was twice the size i think my upstairs neighbor is stealing my power especially when they do construction work upstairs also see fifth fifth problem is the local drug dealers live above us so they have clients that come at all hours purchasing and staying for weeks at a time apparently bowling you know when the drug den is open when every parking spot at the south end of property is full note to any local law enforcement reading this review i am quite willing to host an undercover officer anyway my kids open the window and they get a face full of drugs the manager says they will tell security but what they do not tell you is security is there  hours a week writing maintenance reports not patrolling when they are awake anyone interested i have photos of security asleep in summary i would rent the problems for month but not month|not even worth the  from local flavor course does not regulate golfers at all so you have fivesomes and singles everywhere so as a two some who shoots  on  you are either jammed up by large groups our constantly being passed by singles makes for a super frustrating round course should split up larger groups and put singles into twosomes add the crappy conditions of the cart path and course and it isnt worth the gas to drive over thanks for starting christmas out with a bang|its a great restaurant but i cant recommend this place because you have to wait in a very long line to get in  but what if youre already hungry  i was waiting in line and some angry old white man poked me on my back startling me  any decent person would have simply said excuse me  this restaurant seems to attract a type of clientele which doesnt have my best interest at heart  the food is pretty average  the prices are a little pricy depending on what you order  if you come alone you have to sit at a very small table  its tiny  you cant even stretch your legs or arms  i do like their omelettes however  it would be nice to only come here when its not busy  if you are an ultra conservative republican and lilly white you will fit right in in this place  if not  good grief  try going to the egg and i instead  they are more accepting of diversity over there|i dont go to applebees in general very often but i do remember the food being decentnot the case at this location warm springs  we ordered mozzarella sticks as an appetizer they were barely cooked  cheese not even slightly melted on the inside  i got a steak ordered medium and got just below well done  it was seasoned nice though but why even ask how i want it cooked if youre not going to get it even close  my friend got the chicken finger mac n cheese and she said it was pretty substandard we both agreed that this is basically dennys quality food but at twice the price|good food not great terrible service rude waitress will not be back not sure how they stayed open  years|extremely small room with a view of the side of another building up close  what more can i ask for  how about a tv with a missing remote yes strange stains in the bathroom sink yes all for over the price of hotels on the strip itself  oh yes|do not eat here or from here i ordered food from the the eat app and it never showed up after an hour i called and was left on hold indefinitely i tried to call  minutes later and the phone was off the hook after an hour and a half i called a girl answered i explained my situation she proceeded to tell me that the delivery driver went home and the other driver wouldnt be to work for  minutes and it would take another  minutes to get the food i told her to cancel the order but she told me i had already been charged she did offer me a free dessert or soda do yourself a favor go or order from anywhere else other than this establishment extremely poor customer service and unacceptable damage control do not eat here or from here|the entire team in this location is a joke a simple trade of my cracked screen phone took  hours they had me wait  mins past my appointment and kept taking in walk ins ahead of me and the staff blamed we had call outs for the delay im sorry but how is your staffing issue a factor in my long delay shouldnt u have scheduled less appointments if that was the case they were unorganized noncommunicative and rude been a fan of all things apple and have never received such inadequate service even their busiest store on th in nyc service their customer with more care and proficiency will never return to this location town square summerlin and forum shops will get my business from here on|wont be coming back we have been coming here for over  years and they have decided to chase the tourist money this used to be a great locals  place but they have decided to upscale  please you are next to a motel  they have raised the price of the steak dinner and have excluded the beer and the rolls really you cant even afford the rolls this is an insult to all the loyal customers that have been spending their hard earned money for years  you have seen your last  from us|wont return again this used to be a great locals bar but is now chasing after tourist money since they have upscaled you are way off the strip and next to a motel  they have raised the prices of the steak dinner and have now excluded the beer and the rolls the rolls really service was horrible  and i think this is a terrible insult to all the loyal customers that have been coming here for many years spending their hard earned money we have been coming here for over  years and you have seen our last  ps i wrote a review earlier today which mysteriously disappeared|very very poor servicewaited for  minutes to be seated and finally got a smelly dirty table with no water no utensils  do not suggest this at allfood comes too lateothers in d area are far better|what is christmas eve and we come to this restaurant kind of as a family tradition well weve been here two hoursover an hour and have yet to see our dinner its busy but not that busy i had to get up and get hot peppers oil and vinegar myself the restaurant should be able to accommodate its patrons this is really kind of ridiculous and i doubt well be back|we called in to order food for christmas eve they said that the food will be ready in a couple hours mind you we called at  and we went to pick is up by  we get to the place to pick up our order to find out that our order wasnt put in to their system note that we have our family counting on us for our christmas eve dinner when we tried to explain that we had up in the order a couple hrs ahead the girl who was helping us daniella just told us we know but this is reality what can you do about it it blew my mind on the level of unprofessionalism of this place ive been coming to buca di beppo for years and i can tell you they just lost a customer|weve been here for three hours id love to tell you about the food but we havent received it yet we didnt have a reservation so we had to wait for  minutes before getting a boot h in the bar our waitress is the only bartender in the entire restaurant so shes too busy for us now weve been waiting for  minutes for our entrees the restaurant is now closed|our family made a reservation and drove an hour to be here they claimed the systems were down and stood waiting for an hour and a half as many tables were empty and people who came after were seated before us tried to pass the time at the bar which computers were working fineand were ignored for another hour after finally being seated after numerous statements saying our party was next received horrible service and were hardly acknowledged if it werent for the time we already invested we would have left and burned the place down throughout all of this we still continued to be polite and tip well this was the worst experienced ive had in so long|since there have been several changes at chicago brewery i felt it necessary to update my previous review  it appears the restaurant may be under new management as there is now an imposing man who helicopters the restaurant like a hawk making diners uncomfortable  the menu has been completely scrapped for items that we can find at any chain restaurant meaning that our favorites are no longer available  its a shame that after  years of eating here wed actually walk out but thats what it came down to last saturday after witnessing the manager berate our waiter in full view over something that wasnt his fault  not worth going into detail but our disappointment had absolutely nothing to do with any of the wait staff  i hope the owners recognize and resolve the issue|very disappointed right now  ordered the whole turkey  spiral ham feast looked fine in the box when i got home ready to prepare the food i turned over the ham only to find  greenish white mold all over the ham they are mins away round trip now i have to drive back to return it wasted almost  hours on my xmas eve|kind techs but they refused to change the channel had the view on and it completely offends me i asked if they could change it but they refused poor customer service|im not sure if they deserve even  a single star this is absolutely waste of time and money rent a car and drive instead started at am and at  pm still waiting to reach at grand canyon so here is how they mistreat and rip off their customers they tell you to be at a pick up location at am and they dont start the bus until    then they take you to so called terminal for the actual tour bus here you witness rude staff and first rip off they try to sell everything including crappy food  they dont leave the terminal still in vegas until am  they stop at pm at a food joint from where gc is  minutes away they encourage people to watch some stupid documentary at imax   they dont leave until pm for gc   then the driver keeps on reminding that it gets dark early so we have to be back in bus in timely manner   they claim that they will allow  hours at grand canyon but you end up getting less than  hrs including both locations  they stop for restroom break while in way to gc at mcdonalds and which is not equipped to handle that many people they stop at a subway for the same while returning and the situation is not any better  it seems that the tour company owns all those businesses and promotes them all the staff at these places was rude and obnoxious   upon return there is another exchange in the bus for drop offs   the only good thing was that the driver was a safe driver although he was very rude there are almost  buses which leave at the same time so you can imagine  plus people get at every stop at the same time result big time chaos at each stop  rates               outrageous service            horribleoutcome         frustrationaction             avoid|got to go from here a while back food wasnt even very edible scarfed down about a handful as we were starving and then gave up glad we gave up because everyones stomach started hurting not long after think cheap mall steam table food thats sat out for too long and youll know exactly what to expect|just saw the ownermanager verbally berate her whole staff in front of the entire restaurant most unprofessional thing ive seen in any restaurant or retail environment i feel bad for the staff they were providing great service on christmas eve  i see theres other negative feedback on here about her corporate should step in because shes a bad representation of their brand|i am relieved that the other clients had a good experience with dr rogers unfortunately i did not i visited this clinic  and gave my gum treatment enough time to improve i followed the gum graft aftercare instructions carefully my bottom teeth are still sensitive to the alloderm gum graft that didnt take i expressed my concerns to dr rogers and he was rather cavalier about it i wanted to know if he could at least redo the procedure he told me no that it would be cosmetic my bottom two teeth roots are still exposedwhen i visited my dentist and explained the problem i was referred to another periodontist two people in the insurance dental support office advised me to speak to dr rogers about refunding my  i told them about the conversation that i had with dr rogers only to be left in stunned silence the last day of my followup visitone dental professional stated that there was not any gum graft buildup to be seen after the procedure after visiting periodontist  i  found to my horror that i wouldnt be eligible for any dental insurance authorization until  in addition i would be responsible for   for a redo on my lower two front teeth this fee is despite the fact that my own gum tissue will be utilizedthis is a very sad situation to be in especially since we worked hard for our insurance benefits only to be treated as a nuisance for a gum graft|bad customer service from this location server forgot the rice and saucesmgr said he would do something for us in light of our sever  whos mind was flying sky high but didnt do jack shit lots of lip service but no actionhad to remind our server what we needed several times come on dude do your freakin job place was not busy at all we saw him just talking with the hostess up front with no care in the world i had enough and said give me the freakin check and we got the hell outtoo bad the service at this location straight up sucksit didnt live up to the service other locations we are accustomed to|i cannot believe in this capitalistic country there exists a whole state utilities monopoly by nevada energy just like they have in communist russia that allows warren buffets nevada energy in its oligarchy to take more and more advantage of the peasants  its sickening that based on all the data the whole system converted with incentives then switch and baited over  solar customers into  a berkshire hathaway portfolio for their profit|when we visit vegas we make a point to eat here  i must say our recent dining experience was very disappointing   we started with papaya salad which was a little too sweet  the garlic prawns was very greasy pad thai and yellow curry were meh  also the portions are very small compared to our previous visits  we will be taking a break from coming here|the worst service ever if i could give negative stars it would be a negative  my friend  i had  reservations at  a party with no reservations was taken care of due to them slipping the young man   when i complained to him about it he said its vegas  your going to be waiting a while ive been in the service industry for  years in vegas i know who to take care of when its called forwhat a joke|really mediocre happy hour my oysters were a little concerning very dried out and flat will not be back|never again my friend and i both work in customer service and we understand that customers can be terrible people they are not always right so naturally we hate complaining about anything and even when we do we do it with a smile and the empathy that not everything is in your control as an employee however there seemed to be a distinct lack of customer service and overall upkeep during our simple one night stay at the resort  we moved rooms twice and there was a problem in all three rooms we had we paid for early check in and our first room wasnt even clean there were towels on the floor a trash can in the tub dirty drinking glasses on the desk and a distinct layer of dust on everything we called the front desk and they changed our roomthe second room initially had no problems then i took a shower and after i was done the faucet wouldnt stop loudly drippingtrickling water we decided to just give it time and went out for the day upon our return and subsequent outlet search to plug in our phones my friend found that someone had written redrum on the wall while honestly kind of funny it was rather unnerving and we didnt want to be charged for graffiti so we called the front desk again and our room was changedour third and final room had an ac unit with a banshee call that could wake the dead at this point we were tired of moving and tired of bothering the front desk so we just turned it off and went to bed while the staff was great at dealing with our room problems every other time we came into contact with someone else it was not a pleasant experience we wanted to know where to stow our bags before our flight left after we had already checked out the mlife check out desk woman looked like she was trying to ignore her customers rather than deal with them as we had stood in line for a while and she didnt even look us in the eye once we were there a good while before we gave up and moved onto the regular check out line where the woman there also barely looked us in the eye before barking out bell desk and gesturing in its direction the lady at the bell desk just scowled at us before gesturing  to the bellman standing behind us who turned out to be one of the nicest people we came into contact with she then went back to some conversation she was having with another bellman to top it all off my friend ended up talking to the manager on duty who tried to smooth everything over with a  lunch voucher to diablos which unbeknownst to us but should have been known to her was closed for the season in the end nothing really seemed to be resolved and we couldnt get out of that building fast enough|i have been here four times before and few years ago  once for our anniversary and had good experience came here once again in  dec  it has changed service is very poor i came for three nights  with my wife and four year old it was a spacious  plus sq ft room with nice bathroom and extras for every bad experience i am taking a star away in my review and its just first day into the stayit took  minutes to get a person on line to order dinner  and they dont have kids menu the reservation included breakfast when called it took almost  mins hold to get a live person  the bed was bad that i almost hurt my back and neck by the morning king bed is almost queen size in most of other luxury resorts electric car charging is not available at valet they asked me to goto another resort to do charging reallyasked for water and delivered  after almost  hour anything else you ask to the room service they say no very fast asked for foam bath and they said nowent and checked in the bathroom i found it was there in the shower they dont even care what they have say no to any special request|i played craps for a couple hours at the mirage  i had more fun the previous two nights at playing at binions and at planet hollywood  three nights of gambling and i broke even  the problem at the mirage appears to be burned out employees there was a palpable level of disdain emanating from the craps table workers  one employee bragged hed worked there  years but to me seemed to hate the customers and players  these guys should retrain and find new careers maybe  other tables at other casinos were joyous the personnel helpful and positive my wife and cousins hung at the bar while we played  they said the service was disdainful there  we all tip well and have good jobs so it isnt us later that evening i went to another table at mirage and one employee was great so its not all of themi have to recommend crap lessons at planet hollywood  i lost some money there after but thats just the roll of the dice sometimesi have to recommend beatles love showfantastic|already very not satisfied with the service and my room and i just walked ini requested high floor and a view when i got there the receptionist told me my crappy room was the only one available if youre going to bullshit are least look at my reservation and the line behind mendly i understand its the holidays and you probably dont wanna be here but at least sound like youre willing to deal with me for a few minutes more im not going to name names but watch that attitude rd the hallway smells kind of grossth for the amount of money i paid for this room at least give me a clean room and with toothbrushes and paste i asked for extra towels and its been  mins now i am still waiting yes i paused while writing and not mentioning my fken view is the back of the hotel where the ac tube units are i could have spent a lot less money for a cleaner and with view room i feel being liedconed by this stupid socalled starred hotel th the bed is just okay not that comfy and especially the uncleanness of it makes me feel very uncomfortable the complimentary wifi is laggy but useable  called front desk for assistant but waited  for someone to answer i gave up waiting no instructions on how to use certain things in the room and no menu on tv channelsetc i paid  with a deal including tax and everything upon checking in it charged me  instead not that i care about the extra  but its the principal this is only a star worth hotel to me probably one of the worse if not the worst for the amount i paid|when i checked in speaking with carmen and promised view of strip with upgraded room that did not happen we received view of back of mgm very disappointed here with my parents and wanted them to enjoy there stay refrigerator was stocked with beverage and snacks overpriced oz pringles smart water    room was dirty candy rappers in nightstand  mildew on shower ceiling not good for me we will not be coming back|i wont be coming back here again it was a mediocre hotel i felt like the casino was dirty it wasnt clean looking i felt like our room was dirty too a little icky i found a used bandaid at the food of my bed sick the hotel is in a perfect location literally across the street from walgreens and walking distance to the fashion show mall i wish this place was cleaner we wont be back|we chose this place based on the good rating on yelp but it turned out to be a very bad choice there was  of us some of whom on their own and some in couple when we told the waiter we were splitting the check he first brought us a series of wrong checks and on asking to correct them he seemed to get frustrated and started to treat us rudely i went to talk to the manager but he didnt behave the way i expected and told me we should have told the waiter at the beginning he apologized at the end but he didnt seem to be  concerned about us as his customers btw the food was just ordinary|worst customer service first time staying here and its been the worst experience dont recommend this hotel| sucks crappy room light fixtures were broken room was  degrees heater was on blast and unadjustable desk service was extremely rude nothing positive to say not one told to go down because no one would be up to check the room within any timeframe|ripped off booked thru priceline but the  resort fee doubled the price of the room and the reservation could not be cancelled all parties know this but falsely advertise totally sucks|party of  i expected a lot more than what i got for  dollars  steaks over cooked meat was well done and dry  vegetables were  tasteless needed some seasoning the deserts were not very good very bland   the lobster and shrimp were great the coffee was starbucks which is not my favorite  service was not good  the waiter seated us left and seated others we had to wait and wait to get water champagne  and even longer for coffee its all las vegas hype   i would never go back again  we had a better meal at he gordon ramsey restaurant at paris  we paid  dollars for a crappy meal  do not waste your money|i can only hear maybe  clappings throughout the whole show even the funny scenes only some very awkward laughter from the audience i guess we are not the only one that thought it is the most boring show ever|we came here on our anniversary when we made reservation and my wife had ask the hostess to make sure they have the pre show menu and she said yes  when we arrived it was only the holiday menu available no apologize nothing  thanks for ruin our anniversary|entirely unimpressed service was adequate not deserving of the  auto gratuity the staff were barely present in the dining room unfortunately we had to search for reservations last minute in the area and we didnt want to wait to eat until pm with  kids portion sizes were minuscule for the prices they charge the shrimp  scallop scampi was coated in garlic the surf  turf was more like an appetizer with a  price tag the desserts were microscopic for  i would be embarrassed to charge people these prices flavors are better at maggianos dare i even say olive garden i couldnt leave in good conscience without letting them know we were dissatisfied the manager was flippant and wholly unapologetic for the disappointing experience no wonder they have  stars they should have less the entertainment was equivalent to a wedding nightmare dont bother with this place you can get better quality  tastier food at any corporate restaurant|if i could give negative star i would dont come during xmas time horrible  hrs wait and no food rude staffs especially the elder gentlemen on the carving counter super rude and practically throw the food at me|food is overpriced but very poor quality  chicken was reused from morning an lamb was old and not properly cooked  i would not recommend this place for the money buffet is  which covers only basic items|i am really angry with their bad service and the weird design for the restroom i got liquid soap on my cuff three times it is not worthy for waiting nearly two hours|what used to be a great place has become ho hum lower quality meat smaller portions which are still large but price is way up there   for  sandwich with fries  drinks the change to cafeteria style is silly  servers standing around with not even quarter of restaurant full|general consensus gm is very loud and demeaning to managers which has a horrendous effect on patrons|the wait time here really sucks i almost waited here for an hour for getting in and having my food on table so be prepared|we were super disappointed in this place we were going to have christmas eve dinner at the buffet inside caesars but the wait was  minutes we decided to check out triple georges instead my husband got the meatloaf and mashed potatoes which tasted like a hungry man tv dinner i paid  for the grouper fish dinner which was not impressive either we are super disappointed that we did not like this place|i signed up for a yelp account specifically to warn anyone and everyone against staying at this hotel we are marriott rewards members and have stayed at dozens of marriotts across the country yet weve never had an experience quite as bad as thisupon checking in we handed over a credit card and we checked in and everything was fine for two days on the third day we were locked out of the room for an hour while they finally sent an employee up to let us in giving us no indication that there was an issue this pressing the entire timeminutes later the phone rang and jonnie female name was on the line saying they never received payment and we were being removed from the room without it i said we would bring them the same card that they apparently never received in less than an hour as i wasnt in the room at the time and she agreed that would workdespite this conversation as i hung up three security guard enforcers showed up to our room and require not just myself but every occupant of the room to leave to go to the lobby to sort out their failure to swipe the credit card with no warning the hotel was reserved with a card too so they should have had no issue finding the payment informationat the lobby i handed them the same card and it went through no problem jonnie continually claimed her staff left voicemails on the hotel room phone as if that was an adequate effort to contact us about their errormy experience with the staff of the hotel was horrendous especially from the manager at the desk named jonniei cannot stress enough how rude she was even after receiving the card and the cleared payment she continued to defend the fact that her staff did not try calling any of the cell phone numbers on file and did  not try to get in contact with us any other waymake sure to steer clear of this hotel and the manager jonnie if you desire anything resembling customer service|food was good service was horrid for a more than half empty restaurant it took min to get a club sandwich and hot dog the waitress was standing around at the far end of the bar refills on drinks were not offered till the end of the meal try not to go|i have been here twice in the past year the first time was ok this time the service was poor and the food a little less on point  my advice is to drive a couple more blocks to bricktop and get better food and service this time was during lunch with the place about  full not very busy  table of four people we were perfunctorily seated  we waited  minutes for a server to come and fill the water glasses he did say our waiter would arrive shortly we waited another five minutes for him to show up  then he asked if we wanted anything else to drink one member of the party asked to see the beer menu more waiting  brought the beer menu and left more waiting  showed up later and took the drinks order waited some more but not too long drinks arrived  waited some more and he brought the menus  waited some more and he took the appetizer order appetizers came out in a reasonable timeframe took our entree order but when one person wanted something he was told they were out of that and two other entree items could of mentioned that when he gave the menus  food came out in a reasonable timeframe but the waiter did not clear the appetizer plates or the empty beer bottles on the table which had been available for several minutes  just placed the entrees and left  a few minutes later he came and cleared the appetizer plates but left the empty beer bottles   some food  was ok but one member of the party said his meal was really bad and left most of his food on the plate he is a college student and tolerant of college fare so this says something entre plates were cleared fairly promptly but the empty beer bottles remained on the table  water glasses were filled at good intervals check arrived at a reasonable timeframe i seldom write poor reviews but this experience warranted it  due to the food quality poor service and portion size for price i recommend you not go here|oaky had dinner here the other night and was really looking forward to it and it was horrible  yea wine and beer were included and bottomless because the wine was likely made yesterday out of some synthetic package  terrible the stations themselves were mediocre at best italian looked the best but didnt try any as it was all carbs and way to heaven to eat and the latin station was ok with chipssalsa and guacamole bad canned beans orange dye color rice the carving station roast beef i have to say was very good but the frozen crab legs and warm shrimp at the fishmonger looked terrible american was empty when i went to it other than some corn bread muffins and the desserts as wonderful as they looked i saw allot of them in tables with one or two small bites and the rest left in fact most staff clearing tables were clearing plates still full of food i guess maybe two years ago the christmas brunch was far better that the regular buffet  shame  will not be recommending or returning here|i wish i could highly reccomend but this restaurant did not give me the chance what a piece of shit ppl they called we had reservations at pm they close at  lo and behold they called me at  and we told them we were running late be there soon they still had the audacity to say once we spent money on a cab to get there that they were closed to my face i had all intentions of going all out because it is my birthday and lastnight in vegas so terribly upset i had garbage salad  years ago on the strip and never had it since so disappointed|this place has really gone down hill everything is freakin buffet food i went with a party of  and no one was impressed ps nachos suck|bobby is a very rude server she has no personality considering she works at the bar food is very dry and takes a while|warning they are closed  christmas evela casa blanca is losing a grip andor they just do not care   we live in the neighborhood and usually walk there because we have a drink  we checked yelp to make sure this establishment was open before heading out it stated they are open until  pm  we got there just at  pm and they are closed  not to open again until saturday  saw a couple leaving checking their phones probably to find another establishment  saw a man a employee heading back into the buidling ask to make sure they were indeed closed and ask him why they didnt make this clear on yelp and he just shrugged his shoulders  good luck to them in the future it seems they will need it|went there for karaoke filled with a bunch of weirdo regulars one tried to fight me the bartenders did nothing to stop his insane behavior this place is filled with drunks and degenerates that will try to fight you avoid at

comprehensive womens healthcare i was  and it was my first time ever going to see the gynecologist so it was just a regular annual exam plus i had some lab testing done at the time i was self pay and they advised me to get some testing done just to make sure everything was okay when i heard how much it would be i was very hesitant to do it and i figured i could get it done somewhere else for a way better price however the office insisted they would have the best prices and be the best place to go i made it a point to make sure there would not be any other bills that would be coming in the mail afterward and they said there wouldnt be so i agreed to getting it done and payed for it all up front well a few months later i got a bill for around  when i called to confront them about this bill they claimed the doctor ordered more testing without my knowledge and they told me they would talk to lab corp about getting the bill reduced then i got new bill in the mail for  and that is supposedly all they could reduce it to that was over  years ago and i still continue to get the bill for  after i already payed for everything that i had done this was not the only problem i had with comprehensive womens healthcare after this happened i was finally able to get on my own insurance that covered all of my visits and i got on the depo birth control shot which i went in every  months for that and i continued that for a year each office visit i always waited  or more minutes and i always had a different nurse injecting the shot into my butt which was very uncomfortable to me as a newby to the gyno world i had no idea what to expect towards the end of the year they recommended me to schedule my next annual exam which i did and it was not even the same doctor that i went to the first time although i liked this second doctor way better i dont even remember her name and it was weird that it was a different doctor which did a completely different exam then the first one not long after that happened i decided i didnt want to go back there ever again and i stopped going completely recently they called again and recommended i scheduled my next annual exam there so i called to do that and they couldnt get me in for another month and i just decided i am going to go somewhere else i have a lot to say about this horrific place and it makes me cringe to think about going back i would never recommend this office to anyone and i will never go back myself each time that i try to call they are very rude on the phone and i wait for a long period of time and are in a bigger rush to get me off the phone which very similar to being in the office itself if i could give this place  stars i would|horrible not only did they cut my dog but they discolored his coat not only did they do a horrible job but they endangered the well being of my animal i will never take him back there|went to the clinic  guy hacked in his hand proceeded to use the touch screen  no screen cleaner

frustrated with this location i am  months pregnant i have two children currently and have a car that needed some work so i can drive my children around safely so i went to fletchers i went in for some front end noise broken struts control arms and some motor mounts the first time i picked up my vehicle after  of work  keep in mind this is after we talked them down on the price because their origin estimate was completely price gauged the noises from the front struts were still there they said they needed to buy another part  on the house to make a different noise stop so i took it back a week later to get that part installed after picking it up now my whole front end shakes the control arm and axle is clicking and the car shakes when i brake all new problems going on  now there are multiple things wrong with the car that werent wrong before so i take it in for a third time they keep it overnight to hear some concerns i have about the noises that happen mostly in the morning and they test drive it and agree that the noises are still bad and sound like faulty parts at this time third time ive dropped off my car they say that they are out of answers and i need to take it to another location that can help better with foreign cars in the meantime its now christmas eve and im  weeks pregnant out  on a car that runs worse than when i took it in i am very upset that they can leave a customers car like this without answers i will be taking my car to the other location and i will give that location the chance to get it right however i feel like its not even safe to drive my car with my children in it if i could go back in time i would have stopped by yelp and read the reviews about this place before bringing my car here they are going to make it right for me and my family or i am getting a full refund to take it somewhere else please take your vehicle elsewhere if you dont want to be out a ton of money with addition issues to your car i will consider taking his review down if they fix the problem  i have videos recording the sounds that are taking place and how they are progressively getting worse each time i bring my car in very upsetting not okay|if i wanted a pre made breakfast burrito i can go to the store and get one for a lot less so make it fresh i dont mind waiting what you served me today was disgusting|im not sure why this always happens to me when i walk inside of this store i always get looked over even when its not crowded im never greeted im never told promotion deals when i get up to the front and the cashier asks me do you know who helped you today i always say no one its really upsetting because i work in retail so i understand that big of a store you arent going to get someone right away however you should get to that person as quickly as possible yesterday i stood there by the pink water bottles and i had a question and no one was even paying attention to me for all they know i could have been a secret shopper finally i was so stressed and i had to get back to my job in the mall so i just left its really very disappointing and i will not go back to this location because this has happened to me at this location alone way to many times in the past|here is an example of bad advertising my husband and i were shopping at the mall yesterday and we saw banners about the samsung pay free gift no where on the banners tells you where the place is to get your gift so we walked a lot and no one seems to be able to tell us where to find the place we were very tired but we stumbled on macys and more questions more walking to finally get to the booth outside of macys well the free gift is only  for s phones we have s why cant they say on the banners that only s phones qualify complete lack of respect for the customers time absolutely negative kudos for the promotors get a study done on the use of banners and how to use effectively without upsetting people who really wanted to try samsung pay bad

taking my blood pressure and heart reading nothing else was done oh the doctor did listen to my heart he said i would need blood work done and then asked if there was any concerns surprisingly i asked if that was it and told him id like for him to look at my skin as this has traditional been done at previous doctors as a preventative procedure the doctor said he would refer me to a dermatologist and sent me on my way after the blood work was completed i returned to get the results i was charged an office visit for him to read the piece of paper he gave me i then received a bill for both visits the kicker is that because the doctor asked if i had any concerns they charged me for an office visit as i mentioned before every other time ive gone to a doctor for a preventive visit they did a thorough visit and examined skin for any unusual moles lesson learned my family wont be going to this office anymore|simply the worst service i have ever had the nail tech argued with me and blamed me for everything i wasnt happy with the results and he blamed me for choosing the nail polish color then blamed me because i walked in and they were supposedly already closed blamed me as i tried to give him a piece of information to better their service by asking to the customer if they like how the color looks and in my case on a damaged nail the color i chose looked bumpy and uneven on my nail i wasnt blaming the technician i was giving a piece of advice to ask the customer if they like it as soon as they apply it because they are going so fast and switching hands to the dryer which gives no time to check he wouldnt listen to me and start the blaming accusations i left very angry and they yelled at me at he poor dont come back unbelievable how do they stay in business i dont get it|what happened  mimis was our favorite but this location was below average the service was slow and a very loud sneeze in the food prep area creeped us all out all the fruit in the fruit cup still

sat and laughed and chatted with two ladies i finally asked the other banker how much longer it would be and she told me he was helping a customer and had no idea i guess im not a customer and dont matter i dont know what bank business needs half an hour of laughing and chatting but apparently all other customers can be ignored|piece of shitwe waited  hours and turned out something was wrong with their machine and they couldnt accommodate us or some shit  what a shitty place|ive been staying at the cosmopolitan every vegas trip for the past couple of years but i came with a different group of friends this time and they chose planet hollywood since it was cheap  i was skeptical to begin with since it didnt seem very reliable i already knew something was going to get me upsetwell i was right i am sitting in the lobby waiting for checkin  im not surprised to find such long lines of people but getting to the lobby itself is just a huge hassle  maybe it was because ive never stayed here before and didnt know where to go but to get to the lobby it took  elevator trips that doesnt even directly lead you to the lobby  since they chose not to valet which was a horrible idea as well we walked through the miracle mile shopping area carrying our heavy bagsyou definitely get what you pay for and you can tell just by looking at the crowd and the lines during registration  loud children crying jumping around with no parents to supervise them  kids throwing water bottles and running in circlesi havent seen the rooms yet but even the nicest suite wouldnt earn this place more

thirty minutes to get a blanket and theres no apology they have the worst customer service be aware of their manger roberto navarro he is very rude and also hung up your phone if you complain his attitude is its a cheap hotel so you deserve bad customer service |flavorless tacos i added the little container of salsa it too was flavorless this airport has no decent food options but at least it didnt make us sick so busy but just corporate trash that is tasteless and serves to the lowest common denominator between connections|terrible atmosphere rude staff loud obnoxious regulars as the owners just look at you as if you have  heads this is not my first time to this mediocre restaurant but after last nights service it will be my last|poor service okay food and overpriced i thought being off the strip that this place would be good but i have paid way less for higher quality korean food in the bay area washington and la i came here for the all you can eat lunch buffet but it was hardly that because the waitresses did not keep the food flowing for a new set of kimchi it took  minutes and  different waitresses only to give us a single small plate of cabbage kimchi a lot of the poor service was simply because we were not koreanfull korean the tables with korean guests speaking korean got all the meat and kimchi they could ever want with prompt service only wonder the best reviews on yelp are from koreans the meat was okay but the typical favorites such as galbi were not included in the buffet option and available as an overpriced menu item go here if youre desperate for korean food but dont worry about how much it costs the service youll receive and the quality of food youll receive|dont go out of your way to eat here if you are looking for a good steakhouse stay far away yelp reviews for this restaurant is misleadingordered prime rib cooked medium came out rare sent it back to get cooked more still came back rare again but we just ate it anyway waiter never

and overspiced food that has to be thrown out what happened its so disappointing|worst experience so far i checked in at the hotel  hours ago and went from one room to another due to the hotel inefficiency yet still waiting for my luggage this will be my last time stay at palazzo or venetian and wont recommend them either|some of the worst customer experience i have ever come across i came into macys looking to buy a watch and instead had to hunt down an employee that would finally allow me to spend money in their store when i asked multiple employees if they could assist me in trying on some watches they would point to another employee instead of helping me at that moment i waited way too long to be helped and could not believe the lack of customer service in that store especially the day before christmas i will never shop there ever again|this use to be my favorite restaurant but on two different occasions i have called and asked if they accept reservations they said no i come into the restaurant and there are several reserved tables first time i came in with a party of four they had several reserved tables i come into a  hour wait and when i look at sign in sheet it says called in reservation which was a smack in the face to walk in and see a  hour wait we left and went to another sushi spot today i came in with my husband and toddler the first server came to ask how many in our party we replied two and a baby she asked someone and told them how many in our party she thought i couldnt see her past the black curtain but she rolled her eyes and told her to tell us  minute wait there are several tables open and im sitting outside waiting so my husband asked the male server why are we waiting of there is an empty table i come here all the time and always refer people my brother in law comes  times a week but with that kind of treatment for regulars i will stop eating here need better customer service|do yourself a favor and do not eat here food was not up to par and even a couple days old everything tasted like it was out of the can and the margarita was all sweet and sour do your self a favor and dont go to baja miguels we both got sick |yeah well we were visiting and went through and unlocked door accidentally  next time lock the door we had no idea  they treated us as if we were trying to rob the place  the guy slammed the door and proceeded to yell  i yelled back we didnt know merry christmas and god bless you  we finally found the front and were asked if we were trying to come in through the ask  we said yes as we are visiting and didnt see the front door  then was told they were closing in  minutes and the kitchen was closed  when we left the same rude guy yelled over the balcony merry christmas and god bless mocking us|the owner was rude and provided terrible service when i mentioned that water was poured into my daughters sprite he shrugged his shoulders and never did anything about it we had to pull another staff member over to fix it  he told my sisterinlaw to breath twice when she complained that my brother got a dish he did not order  he then ground black pepper on her dish after she asked him to stophorrible|the service was terrible and there is this one waiter who was terrible rude the food was not that great they need better service and better attitude   and they need to pay attention because this on waiter poured water into sprite because she wasnt paying attention|finally it happened was it worth the hype  nopei didnt enjoy the food at all nothing about it was delicious or fresh thanks for the experience though|our server was very bubbly thats about the only positive thing about our experience one omelette came out greasy the buffalo chicken sandwich was just ok but the real kicker was my meal which came out wrong twice im a vegetarian and ordered the open face egg sandwich it came out with bacon the first time the second time it came out it was not at all what the menu stated completely different veggies and cheese after we double checked the menu we let the server know we had to ask that she take it off the bill we saw the manager adjust the bill but he didnt even bother to come and apologize you mess up a meal twice and feed a vegetarian bacon the least you could do is send the manager over to personally apologize i wont be coming back|i rescued a dog and took her to this banfield clinic to receive her shots and to get a wellness check for her  the vet and techs are very nice and do care about animals but i do believe they are controlled by their corporate system and are made to push their care plans and unnecessary procedures to gain money for the corporation the reason i am giving only  stars here is because of the greed of this corporation  my dog had a rash on her stomach and i brought her here to banfield to be treated  they put her on antibiotics and an allergy medicine that they described as being like benadryl for dogs her rash did get better so i trusted banfield for her continued care they suggested we give her the benadryl for dogs indefinitely so the rash would not return  i agreed to this and paid  for  pills which last days as they are administered twice daily  i continued to have the pills refilled for over a yeari recently took my dog to first pet on union hills and th ave as her rash had returned and i wanted a second opinion  the vet technician advised me that i should continue the pills and they could fill them but that they are otc meds called chlor tab that i can get at walmart for less than  for  pills  banfield should have told me this information but they were just fine with charging me  every other month for pills i could have purchased for   very disappointed with the greed of this company|i ordered take out and was missing an order of yuca frita worth  upon noticing when i arrived home i called to the restaurant and told them part of my order was missing and instead of issuing a credit or apologizing for their mistake they denied it and told me that they were closing and theres nothing they can do i will be putting in a complaint to my credit card company asking for a partial refund|someone mentioned customer serviceits nonexistent in this placetwo people see you standing there waiting to order they act as if they dont see youand if you are lucky enough to get your order taken they give you looks like you are there to take their money away and not the oppositei walked out of that place and will never step foot again in it even if its the last place in town for cevapibut luckily there is others that do their job way better than this lot|very slow long wait even with appt friendly staff tho|it says that they have delivery i guess its a lie|we had high hopes for blt  overall avoid  many better places out there  unfortunately it was very underwhelming and one of us got sick with vomit  service was sporadic at best  prices were a little high even with the understanding that vegas charges a premium   for burger and fries for something that tasted like a national chain restaurant burger  drink prices were also a little exorbitant  im a beer guy and this definitely wasnt a place for me  they did have delirium tremens on tap but for  for oz i think ive paid less at ritz carlton bars|i went because there were great reviews on the beef pho i honestly dont know where these people had pho before but they must all be subpar  i must say that i was very disappointed ive had pho at various restaurants across the us and this was the worst the broth was not flavorful and needed more salt pho is known for broth and the complex depth of flavor the beef was tough and in big random ununiform pieces very unappetizing the staff and service were great though|i like the food waited  mins when we were told  when i asked how much longer the hostess  was pretty rude about it waitress did not get our drink orders right and they placed  adults at a  person table it was a holiday and they were very busy but i was pretty disappointed food was good and the price is inexpensive for a steak steak was cooked correctly i ordered mine medium|their food is very good but the service is absolutely terrible they dont interact with you and the waiter is rude and unpleasant for no reason|terrible service owners wife is incredibly rude and maybe just a little spoiledits important to understand that i value locally made products and hard working people i think the clerks a nice and the store is beautiful but that lady just makes the whole experience that much worse for everyoneleather isnt for everyone maybe matt and natt are that much better|decent prices decent selection of beer accompanied with a good decor the dance floor is a bit cramped up but they made a good use of the space availableavoid fridays at all cost filled to the brim with  year old obnoxiously loud and clumsy abbott studentsavoid one of the bartenders as there are some that are apparently pricks and will treat you like garbage because he disagrees with you on saidandsaid subject like for instance giving a tip only if the service is appropriate apparently you must give a fat tip to a server or in this case a busboy even if the quality of the service provided was garbage dont believe me have some proofhttpsislimglpwxtdpngi will not be going to this pub anymore as this is not the kind of service i desire|the initial car check in process is the worst i have ever experienced the ticket writers have been trained to be very pushy and aggressive with the service up sale routine question how many no thank yous does it take for the sales person and jacksons to get the message and stopanswer when a dannys long time customer decides we have had enough and take our business elsewhereoh and i will gladly spend extra money at your competitors because they do not harass their customers and can accept a simple no thank you answer|horrible food been there a few times thinking we might have ordered the wrong food|do not come here unless you want to be intimidated and made to feel stupid i give this establishment  stars but yelp wont allow me to give less than  stari came here tonight december  for our first meal with my mother after we arrived in vegas i found a killer vacation deal over the xmas holiday and thought why not do something different this year anyways  i found this restaurant on yelp like most restaurants i visit while out of town it had great reviews and i was also very excited to try the buttery buns yelpers raved aboutmy experience here was terrible i have never felt so unwelcomed and ridiculed the buttery buns arrived at our table with a bottle of balsamic vinegar and olive oil i asked our middle aged italian server if i could have another plate to pour the evoo and vinegar in he flat out told me this is not how we eat our bread use the same plate you have i was completely floored and just looked at him i guess he realized that wasnt a good answer he then grabbed a side plate from the empty table near me and pretty much threw it on the table the underlying tone of his comment was condescending and made me feel like the way i like to eat my bread was completely irrational i should have asked him who this we is i didnt know a oil and vinegar police existedour server then ignored us while being attentative to all neighboring patrons i was quite peeved and blurted out loudly the service here is terrrible so that all my neighboring patrons could hear me and also conveniently while he was serving them this quickly changed how he treated us he quickly came over and asked me how the pizza was i said its ok then he has the audacity to say its only ok there was no underlying joke behind his comment i just ignored his comment and he left we quickly finished our meal and asked our busser to send the bill i paid leaving a  tip the bussers shouldnt be punished even though they only get a small cut of the tip on my way out i flagged down the manager a middle aged italian woman and told her the situation the first thing she says is what do you want from this as thought she thought i was expecting a comped meal i said nothing i already paid and am not happy with the service she then defended our server saying that he is very good and i that i misinterpreted him and that he was probably joking i was thinking in my head what a joke this is no wonder service is so bad when management cant set an example of basic customer service and makes the customer feel stupid i told the manager we are leaving since this was hopeless the manager then clues in and says lets discuss this with the server and have him apologize to you i declined and she told me to come back tomorrow and she will make sure we get served right no thank you and we walked away do yourself a favor and dont eat here  there are plenty of other delicious italian choices on the strip which provide excellent or even decent service and good food|last christmas eve the owner greeted all patrons except minorities  this was done pointedly and made everyone very uncomfortable  i was very surprised by his behavior and since that time never dined there again|my first time here and not real impressed the strawberry banana smoothie was very good but the chicken salad sandwich was disappointing the chicken salad was very dry but the bread was worse it was clearly very old bread or was left out so the air dried it out i might go back for a smoothie but not to eat|dont waste your money i live in the area and i figured id just drop my truck off for a quick wash please keep in mind that i usually have a mobile detailer come to my office every  weeks but due to the holidays i was too busy to schedule with him that could set my standards a little higher i purchased the ultimate car wash and i was very disappointed in the lack of detail it was heres a brief list of the things that i noticed and you can decide if you would pay for this service one of the employees bumped into the change holder and didnt bother to pick up the change  seats werent vacuumed  windows were cleaned with a dirty rag i had to clean them when i got home  my driver floor mat was wet looked like they dropped it in a puddle of water  trash was not disposed gum wrappers napkins empty water bottles cleaner was sprayed in my cup holder and not cleaned outi would wait a whole month for my detailer if i had to before bringing my vehicle back to you guys|i was disappointed with the lack of training we received we hired mark to come to our home to train our two new pups and work with them on a leave it for our  senior cats along with strengthening our come command  while mark showed up there was more talk than training and it was not worth the money in the end we just cancelled a couple of classes because it was a waste of time|by far the worst show ive ever seen all other cirque shows were great and i bought the tickets not knowing what exactly im signing up for i dont know what cirque is thinking by letting use its name in this way scam|waited in line mins to get an average tasting milkshake in a small cup total let down me not happy|this was really just a disappointment the hostess told us it was a  minute wait even through there were over a dozen tables empty our wait ended up being only about   the server was polite but the food was really mediocre the food came out at different times  the eggs were cold the fish was generic frozen possibly mrs pauls and the fries were floppy and stale the tarter sauce was possibly the worst ive ever had top it off with high prices which its not worth id say avoid it if you possibly can| hours to get our room we were not in a room until after  even then it was not the room we were promised we were told there was a shuttle to the strip but they didnt mention there is no transportation back to the resort if you stay make sure you have money when they strand you on the strip cabs are about |ummmmmm they want me to put my feet in cold water and it has taken  people and  requests to remove the cold water and make it the way it should be for a pedicure then the man believe is the owner screwed up the appointment too hes really mean this review is his christmas present for being such a customer service oriented guy|i get that its christmas eve but theres no line three girls in the back are talking and laughing while we waited in front for  minutes i looked back twice to see if they saw us in the middle of her taking my order she engages another girl in conversation talks to another customer that walks up asking for something when the two girls in the back couldve helped super annoyed and she wasnt even nice probably couldve cared less not really interested in coming back to this location|i placed an order online two weeks ago for a party tray for a christmas eve party and paid for it online i called the night before i needed the items to confirm dec rd and the gentlemen said they didnt have the order when i told him i had a confirmation email he said oh you ordered it online i have to check another computer he then told me he couldnt see it and its maybe because theyre out of bread not sure what that has to do with it he told me the manager maggie would call me in the morning maggie did call me and told me it would be ready for pick up i told her my brother would be picking it up and he had all the info confirmation proof of purchase my brother went to the store to pick it up and they made him pay he had a receipt in an email and they said not sure how we had that because their system says its not paid for my brother paid and then they realized it was paid for they refunded him but said they were unable to print him a receipt to show the transaction absolutely ridiculous and unprofessional i called to speak to a manager and conveniently she wasnt there all they could say was sorry i will never go to them for catering again|stay awayi called in for a takeout order and went to pick it up  minutes later they told meto give them  min  and come to find out they hadnt even put the order into the kitchen  terrible terrible service with a give a shit attitude  thank you for making our

business owner and i work really hard to make ends meet and i believe that represents most of us today well infusion soft held a party at my restaurant and their cfo mr smith was accommodating their event well their food took  minutes to be served and the reason why is because out of nowhere  people showed up that day with no reservation to have lunchplease take note i take full responsibility for that  i was working back in the kitchen that day and i was sending appetizers to their table in the meantime and i have asked my server to apologize on my behalf once their food arrived and everyone finished i served them desserts as well on me and  once again i apologized for the delay and announced that i will give a discount on their total bill well thats where things got awkward the cfo mr smith stood up said to me that if i dont comp their total bill he will ruin my restaurant and spread a rumor at infusion soft and then noone will ever come again i said i will be more that happy to comp most of it but not all of it since everyone finished their meal and their check was significant  then he said no you have to say word by word mr smith i will not charge you anything today otherwise i will destroy your business and in what world people wait for their food in what world a customer has the right to threat the ownerthere you go people infusion soft stands and supports small business by threats to the owner that if they dont get what they want they will destroy you please let me remind you that comes from the cfo not a marketing or an employee  when i agreed to comp the whole tab i have tried to talk to him one last time before he walks out of the door and explain to him that i did  times the business than usual well his wife said be quiet dont talk will make it back to you and both of them walked out laughing  like i was asking for a favor or i have to get a permit to talk to my restaurant that i spend more time that i do on my own house at the end of the day is all about money they dont care about small business as long as they get what they want we mean nothing to them mr smith i dont know how you think you are superior from me i have a bachelors in finance and mba as well plus i have been running my own business the past  years but most important i know how to treat and respect people|do not go to the hospital if you want to be

water server was absolutely terrible ignored us at all cost and came to our table one time throughout the visit his name was ariel i think was his name horrible at least the food was alright other wise i would have been livid|on a bike trip with my family we thought to stop and grab some beer and fried stuff before the trip back we ordered and my  year old brother his  year old wife and i  years were asked for identification my parents were with us and were not carded we told them we were biking so we didnt have our wallets and told them our ages and our dad confirmed we are adults the waiter wasnt having it my dad said okay cool well just get liters then and the waiter took the order without comment my parents shared their liters with us and the manager came out and said though i can see that you are old as you say im afraid we cannot serve you alcohol and have to ask that you not drink any so much for an authentic german experiencealso the foods gross|for the price food was mediocre gnats flying around table and waitstaff not on par with prices on the menu dressed up applebees at best manager more concerned over policy than addressing customer concerns disappointed i wasted my money|love long horn in other locationsthis waterfront location is awful and has gone downhill  after our most recent visit while doing some xmas shopping i can assure you that i will continue to visit their n hills location but the waterfront needs a clean sweep of their awful cooks who cant season a steak properlytheir ignorant and rude people at the hostess desk and possibly the worst service ive ever received in a restaurantso let me say this again love long hornbut not this god awful location which mgt is obviously to blame|horrible the servers really dont care how long youve been waiting to order or sitting nothing even if its not crowded they really do f care about serving you just about setting non occupied tables|ive been here a few times and this time was the last got home my food was wrong and cold i always want to give them another chance because they are black owned but they let me down one to many times|i had dinner here with a friend on  i had not been to a korean bbq restaurant before  what a lively place   you are seated and advised thats its all you can eat for  per person not including beverage except for water or hot tea  there is no wait staff  help yourself and cook your own meal in the center of your table  i didnt find it all that appealing since its a hefty price for the selection  there are a number of raw meats from which you can chose chicken pork beef  most selections are very fatty strips and thats the point  you cook without oil because the beef is so fatty it provides its own grease  once cooked you have to cut away the fat  i prefer lean cuts of meat so this wasnt especially appetizing to me i cooked chicken and beef and overall it was ok  its not my style of restaurant but interesting for a change  i must say they were busy with a lot of people there many kids running around the place  the atmosphere was loud and somewhat chaotic  pricy  i dont eat  worth of food at a normal restaurant|we stopped by for dinner on a sunday night and the place was empty  shouldve been the first warning signwe were seated and the waitress gave a good beer recommendation and seemed pleasant we ordered our food and when it came out the server checked on us a few times but then towards the middleend of the meal didnt check on us again i had a polish with fries and some bangers and mash my wife had steak and shrimp and the food tasted pretty good and the beer the waitress recommended was also good but the service was subpar it seemed like the waitresses wanted to sit in a booth at the back and hang out rather than work they all seemed to look forward to their break to go shop at the outlet stores anyways for being one of only a handful of tables we expected much more attentive servers and better service we were even thinking about getting dessert but ended up going to ask for the check since nobody checked on us|not exactly what i expected from a wendys in the airport i ordered a double burger combo and was perfect as expected for a quick snack but what i did not expect was the condiments that i needed to make this a great meal they did not have napkins ketchup mustard pepper and salt packets they did have a straw for the drink|new management the tipton group isnt very good mark taylor has superior customer service in comparison to tipton group i say this having lived through painful transition  make sure you take pictures of everything and insist on final walk through otherwise they will take it upon themselves to make holes on a door if say they feel compelled you need buy a new one lastly communication breakdowns are common since front desk including management such as tracy is run by people that honestly do not want to help you|all i would like to say is that ontrac is the worst delivery service i have ever seen in my lifei think im a newbie to yelp or maybe not  but since i seen amazon mentioned i can tell you that i have had or suppose to have  deliveries in  from amazon twice they said no such address exists then that would make my wife and i totally senile because we lived in this apartment complex  yrs  time they said they couldnt get in try the front door on th ave in phoenix i had  more  but now there is  more we had a florescent  index card taped to our apartment door   units here  and a package was found in front of our door no knocktoday  xmas eve  we heard a noise and what it was is the package hitting our door no knock i had some  lets say  words for the wanna be delivery guy that i cannot put in here he said thats what they told me to do i guess he cant read either you might as well leave a dollar oreven a quarter in front of the door because i dont believe anyone would just walk by that in fact if i thought of that earlier i should have put a quarter there and see how fast it would be gone please dont use them at any cost i am glad she decided to look becauseit says delivery by pm dont use them if there was a no star that would be our ratingthanks and everyone enjoy your holidays d  d barajashohoho|ordered a dvd from amazon with same day ship option  and unfortunately for me these guys were the carrier  no show that same day and their website claimed that they made a attempted delivery at pm but the business was closedwhich was of course a big lie  the next day i waited all day and login to check on the tracking number every hour till pm all of the sudden their website showed it was delivered at am  i am not sure what kind of monkey business these guys are running  but amazon definitely should not be given their businesses to these guys  oh and ontrac should rename the business to offtrack|worst taste of coffee i ordered coffee with milk and it tasted like milk diluted with water it was not even hot wasted  dollars for diluted milk and i wont go to this place ever again the only reason why this place is popular is its location next to concordia its popularity has nothing to do with its quality of coffee|ordered a  no pickles first sandwich was wrong no worries it happens nd sandwich had no cheese and no lettuce third sandwich had near frozen cheese and ends of tomatoes fourth sandwich had cold cheese and a small little patty i just wanted what i paid for but never got it thats why they get  star from me|definitely not a good bakery for bread i bought a beautiful epi baguette a pullapart baguette intended to mimic the appearance of the flower of the wheat stalk or epi in french wwwpopsugarcomfoodpaindepibread the bottom was burnt i wanted to serve it with soup for company it was barely palatable dunked in the broth i called the bakery the next day and left a voicemail message during business hours no one ever returned my call bad bread bad service in the future heading to madison sourdough down the street for bread full disclosure i still love batchs sweets and i buy their challah at willy st coop on fridays|i made a reservation for christmas eve two weeks in advance i asked them to confirm that they would be open and the young man asked his manager the manager confirmed they would be open for their regular hours and my reservation for six people at pm was gladly accepted so when we arrived on time and found the restaurant dark and empty we had to scramble to find anything else open im used to chinese food on christmas day but it was a poor substitute for the usually fine seafood and service my family has enjoyed at bluewater formerly fish market for over twenty years no phone call no warning no notice just a big helping of disappointment bah humbug|horrible customer service we asked a question and they were like we are busy you can walk and find what you looking for and at the end at the register they refuse to sell alcohol to us even though we were over  and had our out of state ids |i used to enjoy your pizza but upon my last visit noticed a no firearms sticker on your door while it is asinine to believe that a sticker would keep bad guys out it is within your right to decide not to welcome customers who legally and lawfully carry firearms in accordance with local law however since my right and ability to protect myself and family is more important to me that your pizza i will no longer patronize your business and actively discourage friends and associates from giving you their business|horrible appetizer is fine we wait way over  hour and the rice came its really not satisfying for the overcooked shrimp and seafood disappointed|horrible experience wouldnt cut nails down properly and couldnt speak any english they dont know what they are doing run in the other direction and go to one of the other  nail places in the area im on my way to bella nails for a better experience|believe me eyetique  guys optical  norman childs optical are owned by norman childs him being one of the most arrogant people this city has ever produced  his pseudo intellectual halfwit brother bradley is his henchman  these guys are the most unscrupulous people to deal with  stay far away from this company this brand  the arrogance trickles down from the top to the bottom in this company  there are many more optical companies to deal with in pittsburgh  avoid this place youll be glad that you did|tourist talk  the website is a bit deceiving the location and menus are not coordinated  i checked in advance for favorite or palatable items only to arrive and the item chosen was in san diego not las vegas   a very festive atmosphere and lively service the food is served in large portions so one can definitely get a bang for the buck not extraordinary but not flat either  okay we have experienced   hash a gogo we will leave this in vegas|i come to this j in b on a regular basis and dont usual yelp fast food cause you shouldnt expect much   but there manager named jackie is absolutely useless i just dont get why they have such incompetent manager  i had a problem with my order and asked for a manager jackie came out i told her my problem and all i got was a dumb stare from her   i really dont know why i said any thing it just frustrated me even more     i will just have to come back when darlene is on she is absolutely wonderful|living in america you have to deal with a lot if stupid people who dont know how to walk properly  and at this walmart it really shows  its a crowded place where many arrogant folks will literally step out in front of you when youre walking and literally completely block your path of travel so you cant go anywhere  americans are socially inferior to europeans and certain asian countries when it comes to pollitenes courtesy and etiquette in crowded public spaces  it has always been that way because the american way is greedy and selfish type behavior  where people are only looking out for themselves  and not for each other  london is crowded all the time but nobody steps out in front of me and blocks my way for example  the problem with this walmart is the american culture more than anything  socially inferior  so raw and unrefined are the people here|worst stay ever when we checked in it took  hour and multiple request calls for our luggage to arrive from bell services   when you make a complaint they just acted dumb like it is non of their fault  we starved while waiting for our luggage to arrived into room  this is by far the worst  star hotel that i have stayed|terrible service pulled into the lot and realized that i didnt fill up gas they would not allow me to give back out to fill it up the check in was on a powertrip was extremely rude charged me for more gas than what was remaining in the xar terrible wouldnt recommend it|am so pissed off at this bank dont accept any credit from this bank i made my payments on time and get a call on christmas eve saying i was late on a payment i pay my bills on time assholes going to pay this off and a big fu to credit one bank hope to see your business fail big time|now heres the kinda place where the meaning of karaoke is stretched a bit the setup is super bad just a tiny corner in the room where the regulars sit and the equipment is really trashy but yes in the sense of singing music on a screen its karaoke secondly i see so often now in bars where these servers will cater to obviously intoxicated patrons there is something very wrong with those situations not only in the sense of the lawsuits they could face but how aggressive these people get with flirtation and their behaviour i do like the pool tables and its nice to see a dive bar with bathrooms that dont look like a slaughterhouse but there has to be a line with the cleanliness of the bar itself i mean i know its a dive bar i get it but feet sticking to the floor and a bar top that is wet and smells is a bit too much even for a dive standard|members mark took over simply right premium dog food brand at sams club charging the same price on originally a  lbs bag now a  lbs bag they really think people not going to notice it|sorry  but this store puts their puppies in display boxes like theyre products most of them are too big for the small little box theyre stuck in they all look so sad  its depressingthis store isnt a puppy mill they probably get their puppies from one or breeders who dont take good care of their puppies i cant say for sure because i dont know there sure are a lot of complaints about it tho  i had to stop in and check it out for myself idk this store just gives me a bad vibe any pure breed puppy shouldnt be cheap or a few hundred bucks unless its a factory puppy puppy mill that they got for a cheap price|we have been going to anthem hills pediatrics since our son was born he is now  months and we love seeing dr carol vielehr our son got sick and we had a bad experience with drgreen my wife took my son in for a congested cough and runny nose dr green  checked him out and told my wife it was something viral so she could not give him anything it will get better within seven to ten days but if it gets worse come back after  two days i  had to take him in  due to the  fact that it got worse our son was up coughing all night and lost his voice while waiting for dr green to see us the nurse was telling dr green in the hallway why we were there  i overheard her say to the  nurse that she  remembered my wife taking my son in two days proir and she would just tell me the same thing it was viral dr green came in and checked my son over again our child gets scared at the doctors and cries she seemed to be annoyed with him and if you work with children you should do your best to settle them  dr green told me it was somthing viral and they couldnt give him antibotics i felt like she was telling me i was overreacting i left mad and went  down the street to my kids doctor another pediatrics for a second opinion we were seen right away and  not once did my son cry with dr cory she actually sat and talked with my son and i we didnt feel rushed like dr green made me feel  dr cory then informed me that my son  had croup she knew from just hearing him in the waiting room how did drgreen not know he had croup yes its viral like she said but didnt give us a proper diagnosis croup  is something scary  especially for first time parents dr green told us to get over the  counter  zarbees cough surp something that you want to avoid  in croup now that we know the proper diagnosis we can watch his breathing at night we will be switching doctors since dr green seems to be bothered by seeing worried patients mutiple times and not correctly diagnosing our son we will miss dr veilehr|very rude service from someone in the back making the food with braided blond and black hair i dont appreciate you talking crap and saying that you do not care there is a thing called customer service in the food industry and you really should find a job that has nothing too do with people i asked once about my pc hash brown order and all i got was whining out loudi waited patiently i only asked once that was the only thing you had too make for me even though you skipped over my order obviously good job i am not a rude customer i am just trying too get my hash towns i hope your cooperation or franchise sees this|ordered food and delivered to my home via grub hub my second time i ordered yellow curry with chicken and massaman curry with beef also i ordered spring rolls with shrimp the latter was excellent but the curry dishes may as well have been vegetarian lots of liquid and veggies the chicken was sparse and the beef what there was of it had gristle  thats not good chicken and beef dishes should actually contain those ingredients especially since i paid for that im afraid i wont order again shame because i really liked having a thai option for delivery|oysters were frozendrinks were  and nothing special yet we were billed  per drink and they made a mistake and added  extra to our tabthey corrected it but a very odd mistake considering we were the only patrons in the bar  will not be going back|if i could give this establishment zero stars i would firstly me me my party ordered a giant raspberry macaron when it arrived it was as hard as a rock and almost broke the metal fork when i finally cut it open  and took a bite it tasted like the inside of a refrigerator it was either drenched in refrigeration liquid or left inside one too long we also ordered a lavender latte it tasted terrible there wasnt a my hint of lavender at all it was absolutely repulsive the staff had the worst attitude there seemed agitated for whatever reason the prices are outrageously expensive one tiny sandwich is  a dish of disgusting macaroons are  each overall everything was terrible and i would most definitely not recommend this restaurant to anyone|i love the idea of koreanmexican fusion  but i dont know if we went there on a bad day or they paid guy fieri a ton to hawk their place but i wasnt impressed  i ordered the bulgogi burrito and jamie had the bulgogi plate  the meat was dry and i had to ask for kimchi on the side  korean restaurant kimchi on the side  there should have been kimchi in everythingsorry folks im not going back|i usually love this place but tonight around  they are open until  the employee lied and say the fryer was down  it was obvious he just wanted to leave  i am fine with places closing early on the eve of holidays but they need to post it ahead of time not lie disappointed not sure if we will return|this location feels like a prison  everyone that works here is a robotic machine and not really nice  retail robots huge store but bad inventory  could be one of the worst ross stores ive ever been to this ross needs new customer service representatives with proper training on need to learn how to treat customers and most important should know your merchandise  corey at your customer service desk has no clue of your merchandise even when reading tags and comparing them to the receipt she needs to learn how to treat customers with courtesy and even that may not help this person she rejects your merchandise even when the tags and receipt match the merchandise she needs to lighten up a little  a please or a thank you may not hurt either|the store here is clean and has a variety of products like all the hobby lobby stores but there were many problems here we were bringing back a gift of copic markers as we already had the set we were given upon speaking with an associate we were told we cannot return the item without the original credit card used to purchase it we let the associate know that person lives in chicago  miles away she didnt care we then asked if we could get a store credit something she should have offered and we were informed only an exchange for something from the same section of the store could be swapped out really so we had to get something from the same section instead of what we wanted or keep the item we already had merry christmas to you too upon checking out an elderly gentleman tried to buy  items two of which he picked up from sections labeled  off and  off respectively he was told neither were on sale and when he asked why he was only told these are never on sale youre people need training in how to handle situations like this across the board we wont be coming back and i seriously doubt the gentleman in front of us will either this could have been so much easier and instead was made difficult for your associates by your policy that is simply ridiculous for the holiday season and for your customers who in this case will be shopping elsewhere from now on|overpriced starbucks at the mirage and starbucks is typically overpriced to begin with  drinks are easily  more at this starbucks compared to nearby starbucks   for a tall coffee  give me a break  skip it and go to a more artisan coffee shop|bbq meats are good order the bbq meat in weight instead of their combo plater you get way more that way  they rip you off with the combo platter and serve you  less meat but the same price if you were to order half pound of each item avoid ordering stir fry noodles fried rice and anything that has to be prepared in the back kitchen it takes way too long and it doesnt taste good very oilythey microwave their steam rice in a nonmicrowaveable plastic bowl before serving it to you toxic rice wonder why they dont just use the keep warm setting on the commercial rice cooker you can request that they dont microwave your rice before putting bbq meats on top of itthey add  gratuity to your bill regardless of party size went there for lunch with a party of  i wouldnt mind if they provided friendly and attentive service but they dont|as an american im actually quite familiar with sainsburys and other uk super markets as ive lived in the uk myself for a bit but this was the only horrible experience and it was all because i asked one simple question are you open christmas day the simple and easy way to deal with that situation is to say whether the store is open or not but this one worker had to go about it the rough way by giving me the nastiest look and scoffing a no as if i was mental and she kept condescendingly staring as if i had spoken the most unspeakable things toward her please tell me how i am supposed to know if one is to be open on christmas day or not i get it that it may be a cultural thing in which the idea of working on christmas day may seem appalling and unheard of but to one who has not grown up around these parts or has not spent a holiday season here i find it rather difficult to intuitively know which holidays stores are openclosed rather than expressing her ignorant opinions about my lack of knowledge and my audacity to even ask such a thing she could have acted like a professional customer service provider her role entails her to be and reserved such sentiments other than that unpleasant encounter there was a gentleman who provided the expected prompt service by checking the back to see if more items were available and also by informing my dad about the specific times they would be open on christmas eve and boxing day so this sainsbury isnt all bad all in all i dont usually write reviews especially for places like markets but her reaction is literally burned into my memory and im still not all that chuffed about it from my time of living in london and traveling throughout the uk ive never really had any unpleasant experiences shopping at any of the markets but whilst traveling in edinburgh this winter for a holiday its unfortunate that it had to happen especially in one of my favorite cities nevertheless i hope this certain individual realizes the error of her ways and fixes that attitude of hers because if she can make a mellow individual like myself annoyed imagine who else shes pissed off|this was my nd trip the first was uninspiring but i thought i would give it a nd chance i specifically wanted a lunch buffet this time the buffet selection was paltry with barely a handful of mainside dishes the food was fine my first trip but the price increased from  to  was a deal breaker egg rolls what part of india did egg rolls come frommount everest on sahara has a phenomenal buffet and its |i stopped here on a whim as its located next to my banks atm all i wanted was a chocolate glazed when i entered i noticed its attached to a subway weird i was the only customer present and no employees that i could see i noticed a bell to ring for service but an employee appeared before i got a chance apparently i just didnt see her as she was coming off a phone call she asked for my order and as shes doing this im expecting her to wash her hands doesnt happen  that was enough for me donut craving gone walked out empty handed  i get that she would have used a tissue for my donut but she had no idea what i was going to order when she asked plus coming off a personal phone call the least she could do was wash her hands|after some problems with my certified warranty the manager made it perfect for me lexus service still the best|weve eaten here about a dozen times used to be great last couple visits have been disappointing christmas eve was pretty busy  minute line for the seafood station kind of a problem when they enforce a hour time limit for the whole visit condiments empty for food available without a line food generally underwhelming|this disgusting little store would have been decent if it were not for the racist pos that runs and works there the women will follow you if your not white and not the other customers they will take stuff from your hand and not the other white customers and they will constantly be right next to you fixing stuff aka spying on you in any section of the store you can find other places and better things go to a farmers market go to an actual arizona store but dont go here unless you want to support racist biggots|we were at the tropicana to see a show and stopped here for dinner the hostess and our waitress had no personality at all the waitress spoke broken english so we had some trouble communicating the guy who was delivering water and busing tables should have had one of their positions as he smiled and and was very attentivewe both ordered the prime rib dinner the baked potato and vegetables were typical coffee shop fare the prime rib was tough and hard to chew not a good experiance overall|food was good not great the chopped salad was the only thing i thought was great the restaurant was extremely loud the hosthostess didnt want to seat us at the table we wanted the cocktails were tiny  mostly ice for  hate restaurants that do that not very impressed|quite possibly nay definitely the worst pizza ive ever had this place is nestled in the westgate complex among many competing food outlets its right at the entrance so has a compelling location as you walk up to the complex the advantageous location probably explains why there were about  tables of customers when we walked in obviously all first timers seriously i doubt repeat customers exist at this place so we ordered the vegetarian and split the ingredients half and half to accommodate our individual taste for preferred vegetables after about  minutes a pizza supreme was mistakenly delivered to our table they eventually found the right table after another  minutes a steaming load of vegetarian pizza arrived  upon picking up a slice the vegetables and wet cheese all slid off of the slice into a gloopy mess on the tray the first couple of inches of crust was firm from there on out the crust hung like a wet blanket a bare naked soggy bereft of any cheese or vegetables wet blanket of flour it was pretty sickening we pretty much lost our raving appetites at that moment upon reporting the problem we were told that this is how vegetarian pizzas turn out because the vegetables have moisture in them no making a vegetarian pizza and not having a clue is what makes it turn out like that we were actually laughed at like we were being silly for not knowing what a vegetarian pizza was like the pizza chefs were clueless the waitress was clueless we actually had to explain that we were being disrespected and the food quality was actually an issue since the crust was edible we offered to pay half but the waitress by that time visibly embarrassed not only refunded the full amount thank you but also agreed to make us another pizza for free the next time we go there thank you but there will not be a next time we asked a party next to us how their pizza was they said they were disappointed and they expected something much better they said that their crust was terrible yes first and last timers it is sad this place has potential it has a nice pizza vibe to it you cannot beat the location they have but they are going to eventually go through all of the first and only time customers and shut down if they dont get people in the kitchen who know how to produce great quality pizza  pizzas should be great not wet sloggy dough that looks like what you dig out of the sink strainer after washing up pans from a baking session i am positive in a valley of  million people there are more than a handful of great pizza chefs the two working last sunday should pursue their dream elsewhere mama gina if you dropped by this location and tasted what they call pizza you just may want to slap someone its a pizza something alrightjudging by what we were served they probably make a mean soup sandwichnote one of our party had a stomach upset the rest of the night she was the only one who ate the mushrooms there may be other issues besides not knowing how to prep and produce good pizzanote  after reading about  months of reviews it is apparent that about half of the reviewers enjoyed their food and service our service was ok could it be a particular shift issue note  what justification could there be to charge more on nights when the stadium has a game is mama ginas part of the nfl  two menus with inflated pricing just because a game is going on in another building maybe there is a good reason|i hope i can give this management company no star  i booked me night stay  months ago through groupon when the offer first came out with my friend  the hotel told me i got assigned on the nd floor room while my friend got the th floor  luxury international representative told me they are not able to switch due to availability saying that i booked the last minute which i wasnt  such an unpleasant stay in las vegas ever  it is somewhat a scamthis will be my first  last purchase on groupon  rooms are not clean service is not good totally different than you directly booked through mgm signature  no wonder they got only star here wish i checked this rating instead of mgm signature before my arrival|weve been going there for urine have up until about  months ago and then now we went in today creating their pizza from adriana and her husband and found out that their new owners as of  months ago probably the worst service and the worst pizza that ive ever ate my life adriana have the best with guss pizza the way it was before and it will be forever missed because were not going back|first time at arcadia farms yesterday not impressed nice ambiance service weak food not great very slow service warm vegetable salad had very little taste turkey and brie sandwich supposed to be served warm but partially melted brie and cold turkey i wont be back|well i have had plenty of service issues with this zipps in the past this time was the last  we had  people going to lunch and zipps has a company policy against pushing tables together to accommodate  people sowe walked across the parking lot to ztejas instead they seated us and we will drop  here instead if only zipps management would come out of their ivory tower and listen to its customers  this was my first visit back since boycotting for the past  months due to service my letter to hq also went unanswered oh well|first off found them quite rude i had called earlier in the day and discussed film developing and pricing i told that to the woman working the front desk and she goes you called aaaaaanndddd in a rude tone i literally quietly chuckled because it was crazy how rude her tone was i develop my  film at a pro lab in utah and california normally as i am a full time film and wedding photographer i didnt have time to ship the film out and needed the scans right away so i had to use one locally in terms of scanning quality not great inconsistent from frame to frame which shouldnt happen that staggeringly considering most of the  rolls were shot with the exact same settings the sharpening setting was on the scanner is up completely too high way too sharp and very unflattering the color in the scans is way off sometimes way too yellow sometimes way too cyan i tried to fix the photos in lightroom mostly using exposure temperature and split toning to counteract their tones overall in image quality very poor price   for  rolls of film done in one day timeliness was not a factor but i paid twice the normal price to make that happen other big issue is the way they deliver the files they only offer them on a disc if you have an apple mac from the past four or so years you know that they dont have a disc drive the lady working suggested i buy a disc reader for my computer crazy so i had to go to an office supply store buy a usb and bring it back to them waited for them to develop and scan and then went back to pick up huge waste of time considering that every other pro lab delivers via dropbox wetransfer or ftp i am writing this review because i want them to make it i want this lab to survive because film is a beautiful and wonderful medium and i have made a living off of it for years so i would love to see nicer customer service that was an incredibly rude transaction and weirdly she was a lot nicer when i came to pick up the film must have picked up on my shocked facial expression  better scanning i heard they use frontier great noristu and frontier are what my normal lab offers but why was i not asked for a profile lightdark warmcold sharpness level etc all other pro labs offer a custom profile if they do do this that wasnt explained  a different delivery method she made the comment that it would be so expensive to do something like dropbox i would argue that itll cost you more not to in the long run because even if the scans were perfect i would never drop off and pick up a usbdisc every time big inconvenience i know multiple all film wedding photographers in the city who spend  a year on developing and scanning with out of town labs take that business back why arent they developing here the above issues are  why overall please make these changes and then let us know when you have we want you to make it|black woman today on christmas eve was rude to customers told me there is  people in front of me i said thats fine she said it would be  min wait  minutes later it was my turn she asked if i had someone to watch my  year old while i get my cut and refused to do my cutthe girl was doing her best to not have to do work today|came here after searching on yelp for a chinese restaurant to eat on a monday night there was no wait but it took forever to flag a waiter down to take our order when the asian guy with a big white hat came to take our order he looked really irritated every time i asked him a question i understand if you do not speak chinese but was it really necessary to reply back with rude tone anyways we ordered the hai nan chicken rice plate  avoid ordering this because it is not authentic at all the chicken and rice was not hai nan style at all there was no flavor what so ever we also had the salt and pepper chicken wings  they were ok the shrimp wonton noodle soup  the noodles were probably not cooked because they were still stuck together the shrimp wonton was basically shrimp wrapped in wonton wrapper after trying to flag a waiter to get the check we just decided that it would be a lot faster to pay at the counter it would have been better to look for other restaurants in the chinatown plaza|love the food at chicfila however this location in indian land needs to get its act together  the asst manager at this location is very rude and extremely condensending  certainly not up to chicfila standards we are used to  even though i live close by i will never return  had a bad experience when ordering a catering platter because we were not there on time to pick it up it was thrown out  nothing was offered to make it right  clayton the manager spoke to me like i was a child  i am a business owner close by this location and would never treat my customers so disrespectfullythankfully i called stonecrest location and they immediately went out of their way to make things right  i will be giving my business to the stonecrest location from now onthey need a good lesson in customer service|no wonder this location has a  star average rating i made an appointment for an eye exam without first checking out the rating  definitely my mistake i was told on the phone while making my appointment that it should be approximately one hour for the exam and eyeglass appointment as i had another appointment the same day  hours later in gilbert i arrived at  am for my  am appointment filled out my paperwork and turned it in at  am while waiting and waiting i could hear a man in an exam room coughing and hacking profusely i was surprised that someone who sounded so sick was getting an eye exam when the door opened i found out it was the doctor who was so sick he then was telling another worker that he was so sick that he couldnt go to the gym that morning i went to the front desk and explained i did not want a doctor examining my eyes who was so sick lets face it they are in your personal space the girl at the desk acted as if the doctor wasnt ill until a tech indicated that he indeed was she told me there were two doctors and that i was going to see the nonsick one i continued to wait and while i did so i saw elderly patients being exposed to an illness by the eye doctor after being in the location for  minutes and not yet being seen i went to the front desk and explained the situation of exposure to illness and how it can be life threatening to the elderly and how unprofessional the office is for allowing an obviously ill doctor to potentially infect patients i also indicated that my appointment was well past due and that i was leaving the staff simply stared blankly at me i went to a different eye glass location that afternoon and was seen and ordered my glasses in  minutes flat less time than the wait at this location and the doctor did not hack all over me ill never use this americas best location again  and neither will my family where was the office manager during this entire thing very poor customer service and lack of due diligence regarding patientclient health and well being|not original not creative not unique and steals peoples ideas the taste is  star the orange chicken taste absolutely nothing like oranges shrimp toast  jk love this place |i am not sure what has happened but the quality of the food has completely deteriorated in the last  months my partner ordered the tortilla soup and got the chick pea chilli which was cold to boot the tortilla soup which followed was also cold the fried fish tacos which i ordered last night were completely inedible the fish was soggy and did not taste like fish but rather some kind of tofu the black beans were dried out we really enjoyed going to mad mex for the vibe the drinks and the delicious food but will not return any time soon what is going on|okay so where do i start audrey and james are both super nice audrey is outgoing and fun james came off as creepy at first but was cool i guess i went to about  laser treatments for under my arms now let me mention that ive had laser done under my arms before by another clinic  months before starting with audrey she was friendly and made me comfortable she used the laser with gel old school machines the machine was never charged enough and she never did touched my skin now ive had laser done before and sometimes u got a stretch the skin to get all the hair follicles nope she did not even touch me under my arms shes nice but the laser machine they use sucks its old school my skin is the perfect skin color for laser its medium and my hair is thick but after  treatments i saw absolutely no difference now for the brazilian oh god did she even go to school does she know that you have to tell me when to move my leg so that you can do all of the sides of my privates parts hello dont just laser what shows to you basically after  treatments of laser i never even noticed the slightest difference every time i told her i didnt notice a difference she told me that im her only customer to say this really the only one this place just sucks they have the oldest machines and although they are nice they so not know how to laser body parts please dont waste your money like i did you will not see a difference what so ever they just bullshit everything i just stopped going i never even got a call back asking why im not going to my appointments or if i would like to reschedule i didnt even want my money back i just wanted to stay away from this low budget place dont waste your money here haha update audrey please dont sent me unnecessary comments or harassing me im being honest on this site i never said im rich are you crazy i think your confusing me with all the other people you talked shit about dont get me wrong i think your a nice person but you really need to change that machine or go to school for laser im now going to another laser place and when they do my inner thigh they ask me to move my leg up to get the machine in between my thigh i dont want anyone touching me even under arms i think you should move the skin to get the little hairs that are not visible from your distance also you should wear the glasses too help with the laser light every other laser place has the techs wearing them im not a fake nor am i trying to bash you in any way im simply being honest your place is clean and tidy all the time and you guys are friendly however those machines are not meant for laser hair removal im sure you make enough money on people to be able to afford a better and more up to date machine rather than the old gel machines that do not reduce the hair sorry but i had to give the review for future people again i have no intention to bash you so i would appreciate if you keep the unnecessary and unprofessional comments to your self|the place is well decorated and the food looks great i ordered the beef kabob and substitute the rice for the greek salad beef came out very rare instead of rare but i stopped eating when i found hair in my greek salad|do not go here for the food its pretty bad but the overall experience is fun and you will certainly have a laugh|we went on a monday  hours after they opened i was writing down tips to share almost immediately opened at  ran out of lobster at  someone need to do a better job with management of food shipments no blue cheese to go with wings couldnt get all flat pieces of the wings out of numerous other items due to safety precautions on coast bittersweet  wine and beer on website not true beer only this need to be updated couldnt substitute anything not even fries catfish was good but not worth the drive waiter was nice even felt bad they couldnt honor my request king crab legs market price was  lb i can cook this up in my kitchen insteadnot a good st impression|lady at register was super rude rolling smoke  rolling eyes when asked questions  quality went down since last visit  very disappointed |do not order from here ever this store is a joke they made me wait over  minutes and then dropped my bread bowls on the floor in front of my house they then expected me to pick it up and eat it who does that  go to the store on decatur they took care of me even when it wasnt their stores fault they understand what customer service is about not this store here is the review i wrote in the decatur stores page they deserve all the businessamazing service today guys i recommend you order from the dominoes on decatur not the one on blue diamond let me tell you what happened today i ordered three bread bowels from the store on blue diamond around  pm came around and still no delivery i called and was on hold for  minutes and no one answered so i called the store on decatur and explained what happened to jon he tried to call the store for me as well however they didnt answer for him either while i was on the phone with jon from the decatur store the delivery driver from the blue diamond store shows up and drops the bread bowls all over my front door step he looked at me like he expected me to pick it up and eat it i told him to take it back and credit my account i now explained this to jon from the decatur store and he apologized for that stores behavior and sent me three free bread bowls from his store i totally didnt expect that but how amazing is that jon you really made our night and we appreciate you you deserve a raise for going above and beyond even when your store was not the store that messed up you made me feel different about dominoes and i wont let the blue diamond store alter my opinion at all because of you thank you|extremely slow service ordered all you can eat for two people but it wasnt really all you can eat they never gave us any refill|when i called to get hours of operations the person that answered was having a full on conversation with someone else and barely acknowledged me waiting on the phone in between sentences they were very friendly when we got there  food was ok but i thought it was overpriced  i ordered the vegetable soup with pounded yam and specifically said no stock fish my soup showed up with stock fish i barely touched my food my husbands egusi soup was better at the end of our meal we were slapped with a  bill for stock fish that was put in our soups and we didnt really touch my son requested no meat in his okra soup and guess what  he got a bowl full of meat that he refused to eat  ok experience but not enough to warrant a return visit|pizza is good but service not so much called back because i didnt get all my sauces manager argued with us saying we told them not to bring our free sauces no apology and left us on hold so she didnt have to deal with us ill be going to pizza hut or poppa johns where i dont have to argue with management|by far the worst customer service i have ever experienced ever  today i decided to stop in and get my dog some christmas gifts i decided that my dog needed some shirts lots of treats and toys i got into the line and even though it was christmas eve i kind of expected the cashier to be a little less rude and at least smile but nope i was incorrect apparently since he chose to work in the customer service industry which he knew would require him to work on christmas eve he still let everyone know that he was completely over his work day and did not care about anyone in line he made absolutely no eye contact would not crack a smile when you tried to have a conversation so i just stared off into the grooming area that is when i noticed this woman grabbing this poor dog by its facial hair extremely tight so tight that the dog was trying to get away from her she continued to try and shave under the dogs jaw but the dog kept squirming to get away so the groomer decides hold tighter onto the facial hair and almost pin down the dog in a way to prevent it from getting away from the clippers i to look at the customer behind me and her mouth was wide opened as she also stared in horror at how the dog was being abused i then asked her if she was witnessing what was going on and she said that if that were her dog she would go right in there and say something i told her that i would also do the same thing meanwhile the groomer just kept pulling on this poor dog that was clearly terrified on how it was being abused the guy behind the register asked what we were talking about and as i began explaining what was going on the groomer decided to finally give the dog a break because she noticed us staring at her so she picked the shacking dog up and moved to another area and just sat there the guy behind the register briefly looked at the grooming area and then told me my total did not show me where my bags were just told me to have a good day i had to collect my  worth of dog items amongst a ton of returns and walked out i decided that the poor dog needed someone to stick up for him so i went back into the store i immediately walked up to an employee and asked for a manager she told me to go to the over crowded registers and ask for one they would help me once the manager was called i was shocked to see that it was the guy on the register that rang me up i explained what happened he literally laughed in my face and told me he would review the tape and pretty much dismissed me and my concern for the abused dog he told me that he did not witness what happened because he had a line full of people which was a lie he had me and the lady behind me who also voiced her concern about the abuse he told me that he would review the tape and then walked away from me i went out to my car grabbed my  purchase and returned it i was so upset that he seriously did not care he eventually walked up to me informed me that the ladys name was theresa and she did nothing wrong he stated that she would be more than happy to come and explain to me that she did nothing wrong and while i waited in line she gave me constant evil glares  the dog was still squirming and she called over a guy who pinned the dog down on the table so that she could finish grooming the dog the customer behind me explained that she was not happy about how the dog was being treated either but jeremy came back up to me gave me a number with  extra digits he would not get away from me and kept telling me that nothing was wrong with how the dog was being abused i will never shop at petsmart again i am not going to tolerate animals being abused and no one defending them i actually went immediately over to petco of course i paid more for almost the same items but to me i am not going to give money to a company that is completely ok with the mistreatment and abuse of animals|this isnt accessible to airport travelers i would love if j could try and eat here but it seems to be limited to aircrew and employees very disappointed that this comes up in the yelp search|whats happened to kfc i hope its just this location i was just taken for  totally disgustedordered the family fillup bucket and tender fillup box had to throw most of it out i would have returned it but its christmas eve and stopped because i was busy and no time to cook with everything going on  pm and it appears all i got was leftovers the bucket of chicken was heavily breaded and soaked in grease nothing crispy about it the gravy on the mashed potatoes was like rubber thick skim on top of dried out pasty potatoes hockey pucks for biscuits and  rock hard chicken nuggets passed off as chicken tenders seriously they were no bigger than a  cent piece all  laid next to each other didnt even add up to what one tender should be not to mention they were mostly all breading so i ended up spending  for a drink and side of coleslaw which was good buyer beware youve been warned|update i have been working with management on this and they agreed to let me see dr bruce at their mesa location and waived my co pay for that visit it was a night and day difference he reviewed my study and discussed it in a very professional manner the staff was more professional as well i left with the confidence that my situation had finally been properly assessed and thats what really matters long story short i would never return to the phoenix location but the mesa location was well worth the drive thank you for working with me on this|servers are nice but slow and unprofessional rediculously long waits for orders wasted my time ruined my christmaswe placed an order of dinuguan and sisig the day before dec  we needed it dec   we came in at  pm expecting our order to be ready when i came there they told me that my order will not be ready til  pm but that they will start on it now and it should be ready in an hour pm so i waited outside in my car about an hour later i called their phone to ask about my order a lady answered she was slow i undestand its rush hour but she should have been atleast professional enough to answer my question promptly considering i waited an hour for my order she made me wait for so long on the phone before she asked me again to repeat my question she did this three times i can hear her talking to other people on the background about things that are completely unrelated to my order obviously she does not care about the person on the phone which happened to be meafter waiting forever for a simple answer she finally told me that it would be an additional  minutes of wait i explained to her that another server told me it should be ready around  pm but she said no because apparently the dinuguan takes really long to cook very unreasonable answer clearly they have not even started cooking it and just dont want to own up to their mistakeso we waited an hour and an additional  minutes for a simple order my advise for them is that please be prompt with questions next time never make customers feel forgotten on the phone and please get the food ready at the time you said it should be ready very disappointingupdate when we opened the food it was very very oily but it tasted good but still upset about the almost  hours wait|i went to get a caesar salad sometime back i specifically mentioned to the african american lady who was at the register that i am a vegetarian and yet she sold me a caesar salad without mentioning that has avalon in the caesar dressing and that is only kind of dressing they have for caesar salad i wish she was paying attention when i said i am vegetarian not just sell something she should be given an opportunity to work on her listening skills and should be fired if it doesnt improve eating meat is against my beliefs and she clearly ruined that for me|awful you know its one thing to be a dive bar and hang on to that niche market of the locals and drunks but to allow those people to affect other patrons nights is unbelievably sad now i have nothing against the lgbt community but there are several very aggressive females in here who continually made my girlfriend very uncomfortable with their advances and the bartenders and servers seemed to think think was hilarious secondly the dj for karaoke by the name of steveo caters to only his friends unless you tip him very well in his own words i happen to enjoy a karaoke night out but i would caution you to stay far away from this watering hole lastly if its a dive bar maybe stop handing out free cocktails to your buddies so your drinks dont have to be overpriced for a actual paying customers just a thought time out yah thats a good name for a place that should stay in the sidelines|dont waste your time and i mean a lot of time completely unorganized i signed in before two other people who said they did not have appointments but they went back first was told it will be one minute left  minutes later without a haircut|i would put  star if i can  electronic checked in at  in line to pay at pm for tax per person actually sat down to eat at pmfood was awful been sitting out for a long time or ran out  oyster still not totally raw   totally lose appetite after eating the oyster  my son puked not because of over eat but not very good food    soooooo disappointed|the visit was ok nothing special but the business office and payment process what a nitemare  ended up hsa  i did speak to the business office that i was trying to see what and why they did not receive pmt from hsa did not get to where it needed to go and account ended up going to a collection companyno phone call no past due dunning late notice received then a processing fee for the collection plus the charge for it going to collection  so will not be using this company again unless absolutely necessary|we went to see these lights last night   we drove up and could not discern how long the wait would be so we opted to waitsince we had driven from henderson  long story short  the wait was  hours for a  minute drive through  would i ever do it againnever   the lights were okaybetter to grab a hot chocolate and look at the decorations near your home|i am not sure how they get this high rating food was bad and they even charge for kids under  horrible fish on top of sushi is as thin as shabu shabu meat i thought i was eating shabu shabu sorry but i will never go back again|we decided to eat here as my car was being serviced next door i wanted to like this restaurant considering it is locally owned our server was prompt and courteous and the food was bland unfortunately it was a disappointment from being ignored when we waited to be seated to the extremely soiled floors when we went to pay the cashier had a difficult time processing a card transaction i understand these things happen but rather than asking for help she continued to struggle for a very long time without acknowledging anyone in line just not a good experience whatsoever|made an appointment for  pedicures came in and my  friends got their pedicures started right away which is why i gave  stars but i sat in the rd chair with not even some water on to keep my feet warm for almost  minutes before deciding i no longer even wanted to waste my time knowing that if i started a pedicure this far after my  friends my pedicure would be rushed and short to make it seem like we would finish around the same time its a shame that even with an appointment i cant get a pedicure in addition one of my friends paid for the royal treatment pedicure with an extra long massage and that massage since i was bored in my chair i timed it lasted  minutes in what world is that extra long will not be returning to this salon|this place was honestly disappointing the reviews said it was good but honestly it was not made my stomach hurt after eating tacos there if your craving tacos i recommend tacos el gordo they even have free transportation to and from the restaurant| star for ok drink deals got a pitcher for less than  of good beerfood is not so good the french fries tasted like they were from a big old bag of frozen friesworst of all this place seems like a cheap attempt to pander to wiscsonsin and madison the wisconsin and up north feel comes off as cheap and halfaed|wasnt impressed when i walked in and the staff is kind of doing there own thing a woman asked if i needed help and i took out a kay jeweler box and told her i received this as a gift and need to get links taken out so it fits my wrist  she then asked if i had a receipt with an attitude as if i were trying to return something she grabs her magnifier and looks at the bracelet with a ton of caution and then hands the bracelet to a gentleman of very few words who worked on the bracelet and took the link out for me  ive worked in retail for many years and i understand precautions you have to take but show empathy and compassion in what you do so the customer doesnt feel that you have to take precautions before deciding to work on the product|i have to give  starts to this location because of the disorganization that they have called december rd as soon as they opened  am and placed and order for  cakes  one red velvet and a white white chocolate i was told to pick it up after  pm came at  asked for my order and after she went to the back to get it she came back and said that they didnt have my order she went back to the back and told me that they dont have my order but that i was lucky because they have one red velvet left  but didnt have the white white chocolate i looked at the fridge that they have at the front and there was one there after pointed it to the girl  she looked at me weird  and exclaims oh reallyi got the cakes but since she told me that it was the last one im basing this review  on the disorganization and the chance that the store would have left me and the family without dessert other that that the cakes are great|dont be fooled by the hype  we were vastly disappointed  the service was horrible we apparently arrived as the shift was changing and our server didnt inform us or the new server that she was leaving so we constantly had to look for someone to help us  we had to order food with the bus boy  the fries were cold and stale and the burger was the epitome of mediocracy  the burger lacked any sort of flavor for the  cheese burger with added bacon and was small  real talk go to fat burger and have a tasty burger that will satisfy that nasty gnarly burger flavor your tastebuds lust  i think what sells the burgers is gordon ramsays face and name all over the joint|i rate the decor and service of andreas  stars but the food  stars  we ordered their signature dishthe five spice lobster tempura for and it was probably the worse lobster dish i ever ate at an asian restaurant  their chicken adobo entree was extremely salty so i would avoid this one too  the crab fried rice was good and my kids said the california roll and philadelphia rolls were the best tasting ones they ate  i ordered the three sashimi chef sampler appetizer for  and thought it was just ok tasting  the sashimi was sliced so thin like shabushabu meat which i found quite annoying considering the high price tagoverall i am not eatting here again  i wish i could have tried their mt fuji dessert but the regular food here sucked to be honest for a top restaurant in encore|ok so normally i dont write bad reviews but this case is exception  lets just say that our lunch was close to two hours  first ramon was terrible  over cooked and probably a frozen noodle  every dish came one at a time probably every half an hour  sushi tasted fine but service was pretty bad and unprofessional  for the amount of stars this place has service and food control was disappointing  dot get me wrong if your ordering maybe couple dishes or eating by your self then im sure its fine  for large group its the worst place to eat|horrible liars and no customer service  they are an authorized ftd delivery service  i think not   ordered online for my mothers th birthday paid a small fortune for flowers and guaranteed delivery  well got the email confirmation they were delivered and they were not  according  to the driver they were signed for by my mother impossible since she is in an assisted living facility and security must sign liar liar liar  thanks sonny for ruining my mothers th birthday and christmas  when you call ftd they apologize but i got the florists direct number and they could care less  warning do not use ftd online nor this florist|the food is good but the service i experienced was not at all we came in around pm sat down and was helped out by a random employee who wasnt one of the actual servers after ordering our food and waiting which is fine obviously the food has to cook when the food was done the lady running it took it to the wrong table in front of us and gave them a grilled chicken sandwhich i had ordered with a few things on it held they communicated with her that theirs was crispy and not grilled instead of discarding it or fixing the error she gave it to them for free along with their original order i had to order another one and wait  minutes for it and it came with everything on it after ordering it twice with a few items held no one ever came by and asked if i wanted another beer or if the rest of my party wanted any soda refills i work in a restaurant and the service that i experienced is not acceptable at all i honestly could walk out of the restaurant with my party and no one would even pay any attention to us very disappointed|combo dinner for  they charge you more to substitute vegetables over brown gravy spare ribs and to have the chow mein and fried rice sans chicken give me a break that makes no sense whatsoever and punishes people for being vegetarian youre sooo off my list famili|honestly its just too crowded to me hakkasan just feels very capitalist with very little regard to guests they attract huge crowds by bringing in the worlds best djs to be fair the talent they bring in is absolutely ridiculous tiesto and calvin harris have residencies and equally bigname djs are regular at the club in spite of that its made a lot less fun by the dangerously overcrowded space on the main dance floor theres no room to move let along dance if you pause to stand in one of the throughways or stairs the staff will berate you until you move the only folks who appear to be enjoying themselves are those who booked tables which are lucratively expensive anyway the ling ling lounge downstairs is less crowded but still pretty crowded and plays hip hop music i think drais and xs are much better places for folks who like dance music and like dancing hakkasan is kind of miserable|horrible dont waist your time or money waited an hour for the food which ended up being such a disappointment horrible disgusting and way overpriced|dirty bathrooms were kinda gross no toothbrushes or anything at the front desk the complimentary breakfast was uneatable they gave you frozen pancakes and waffles that you had to put in the toaster seriously ive never seen a hotel do that they didnt even have orange juice they had tangwtf i know this is a cheap ass hotel but jesus christ this place looks like where crack whores go to stay|ordered pizza delivery super late the other night and not even being starving drunk could make this pizza taste decent gross only upside to this place is their hours and that the delivery didnt take forever like a lot of places in vegas but even if it showed up instantly if its disgusting does it really matter even sophias is better than this|worse parent and child parking spaces i have come across in a supermarket hardly any space between bays never mind when people dont park correctly whats worse is that people without kids are using them without any shame please sort this out|overcharge  for parts and labor   is a  ripoff   shop please dont go in |just left didnt even eat too many tables were open and available  but no one was getting seated and it was very crowded  poor frontend management|i scheduled a flight through travelocity and the airline cancelled the flight due to mechanical issues and had no other flights and said that they would refund me apparently these refunds need to be passed through travelocity each and every contact with travelocity to get my refund to include being on hold on the phone for over an hour and another call where i was held on hold for  minutes  i was told that the only way that i can resolve this matter with travelocity is to call on the phone i am deaf and have told them this a number of times and yet they insist that i call this is the st centurythere must be other means of being able to resolve this without a phone call texting emaili would strongly discourage any hearing impaired people from using travelocity as their only means of resolving a problem is by phoneand if by phone expect long periods of being on hold and still not resolving the issueupdate travelocity finally refunded me my money for the airline cancelled flight|worst place to have breakfast if you want cold pancakesburnt bacon poor customer service then come to new day cafe should of went to ihop|buying a car was a good experience but service department is totally the opposite its not only training what they need specially becky customer service standards require more than a smile and not even that i was provided worst service ever|if you enjoy being ignored by hipster wannabe wait staff and having overpriced tacos this is the place to be|if i could actually give this place no stars i would the food is horrible it would probably be a little different if they changed the grease that they cook their food in|first and last time they are very nice workers and and have a nice a clean shop but i stopped for the ham and cheese and donuts there maple bars have a slight hint of maple more like a regular one super tiny and there ham and cheese was a joke huge some what taste croissant but one super tiny piece of ham was so funny that they have the nerve to take pride in serving it well im sorry it looked nothing like this picture was a joke i thought well you got my  but i will never come back again|we recently took a trip to glendale az  were the most excited by the online reviews to splurge on a nice meal at whiskey rose  could not have been more disappointed  we arrived the first night on a wednesday and it was not busy at all  still the service was incredibly slow and inattentive  by the time we finally got our food  out of  meals were ice cold  we received our side dishes  mins after the meal  upon paying the  tab we had a conversation with the manager about our experience  he offered to take care of a round of drinks free of charge  which would have been very nice but it took over  mins and we received nothing  finally we just left with a our trip just starting  zero chance of coming back to whiskey rose  i would highly recommend not wasting your time or money  there is a great place across the street that received our business everyday for the rest of the trip  whiskey rose was the only bad experience of the entire trip otherwise i highly recommend glendale az and the westgate area|awful customer service we bought a sharp tv and were not happy with it we even attempted through both sharp and conns to get it repaired but there was a manufacture issue that was not repairable jumped through tons of hoops even got sharp to issue a letter to conns to let us return the tv only to be informed it was pass the deadline and they would only allow us to return it for the same tv no store credit nothing do not buy from them if anything is wrong or you are unhappy with your item they will give you the run around|third time here very poor service waited in  min intervals to ever see waiter they said they would comp deserts then ended up not will not return|the bar sits in the center of the gaming floor and is very attractive part western part modern its just inviting and handsome there are some signs that advertise craft cocktails prohibition drinks and the like we went in on a slow wednesday  at  pm and it was fairly dead maybe  people at the bar i normally have wine but the idea of a retro prohibition cocktail sounded appealing i asked greg the bartender if he knew how to make the classic cocktail the sidecar greg assured me yes he could so i ordered itwe watched him work his magic first he heavily sugared a martini glass rim then got a glass shaker cup and added a good  ounces of captain morgan spiced rum a hit of premade sweet  sour mix and a hit of triple secfor the record a proper sidecar is a simple drink  ingredients cognac fresh lemon juice and cointreauwe proceeded to tell greg we werent sure what he had just concocted but one thing was certain it was not a sidecar to our shock he insisted it was and basically said we were wrong i suggested he google the drink he was totally arrogant rather than leave the bar i ordered a stella artois which he promptly rang up and put a bill in front of me even though we were playing video poker i waited for some type of apology that never cameavoid this place nice dcor only goes so far the staff is untrained lacking basic spirits knowledge and worse arrogant there are so many better bars within walking distance|bought  tickets for this adventure and only  came to realize that the place has closed when we arrived my bf and i walked from the strip  the zipline is closed  from dec  i bought two tickets on december  through vegascom and never was notified that they had closed off the zipline it is unprofessional to be selling ticket on days they knew the zipline were closed i would rather drive to mexico to zipline than try this attraction again i would not recommend this place|i was really excited about this place because it advertises itself as vegan and its a mac and cheese place finally some mac and cheese with vegan cheese substitutesvegan cheese nope  all cheeses are dairy so idk why this place is advertising as vegan probably because they have salad but thats bullshit give me vegan mac and cheese|friend of mine got some white widow here today bunk and not just old or anything the thc  was below par for calling it this strain then we tried the blueberry wouldnt even burn this place is a joke they do not even tell you the strains potency they should be shut down based on that alone they are a poor example of what it means to run a successful dispensary we want our  dollars back why wouldnt you tell people the  perhaps its because you guys are all full of crap do not go here|i guess im not a fan of cafe moulin but am torn between  and  stars i dont like going there but i know others dont hate itokay so i guess ill make a pros and cons listpros nice atmosphere aesthetically appealing and cleanfood is consistentcoffee is greatconsusually a very long wait time youll wait to get seated and youll wait to get food very small restaurant with limited seatingthe food is average ive never had anything bad but i havent had anything that was really good either ive had different crepes and theyre all pretty basic and average tasting i finish my plate but am usually underwhelmed the service can be bad not just bad because theyre slow which isnt always their fault but bad as in rude and sometimes they seem agitated ive had some pleasant interactions but generally they are very curt and dont seem to care that much about how they interact example a server didnt bring me an item i ordered when other drinks were brought to the table i flagged him and politely asked for my item and was told that he knows and its coming and then there was this eyeroll and it just describes the service you can expect to get every once and a while at cafe moulinif you want crepes and cafe moulin isnt busy you can try their crepes without fear of food poisoning or being dramatically disappointed if its busy i would consider waiting in line elsewhere|walked in the door it took  min for someone to come up to the front then we would have to wait  to  min to get us a table the place was empty i would have preferred to be at a table and browse the menu since it was the first time definitely the last time as well|the absolute rudest service poor quality always get the order wrong and dont stand by there quality inspire of their high high prices  wont come here again |i have long avoided delta for my dissatisfaction with the declining service i especially dont buy flights that arent direct because i just expect that theyll be delayed and ill miss my connection as it seems to be the norm i accepted a sky miles flight from my parents for a flight home for christmas which of course has a connection in atlanta we were initially grounded for bad weather which is completely understandable i am a reasonable person and dont want or expect to fly in bad weather we were de boarded from the plane after sitting on the tarmac for two hours what made this an unacceptable experience is that we were immediately re boarded and we had a confirmed flight time but missed it because someone from delta deleted us all from the flight and they had to straighten that out they arent offering any compensation because we are once again grounded for bad weather no regard for the fact that we missed our flight to atlanta because delta deleted our flight i am still sitting on the airplane for four hours now im hungry and its christmas eve come on deltaand they wont let anyone get off the plane just long enough to eat im hungry it is now pm and ive been on the plane since amnow its pm and we are supposed to be in the air according to our last update  hours ago no updates they are counting us again for the third time since deleting our flight and the passengers on itnow im returning home on this really terrible airline for some reason on the flight here and the return flight they didnt give me a seat assignment on the way here i went to the gate agent and got a seat assignment for both legs of my flight without issue on this flight i had a seat from birmingham to atlanta but not from atlanta to charlotte i tried at the beginning of my flight birmingham to get a seat and they told me that i have to wait and get it in atlanta now im in atlanta and im told that i have to wait until one hour prior to take off  minutes from now to get a seat assignment i came to the directly to the gate after landing in atlanta and i want to get food and an adult beverage not wait at the gate for a seat not giving me enough time to do so for some reason this airline wants to starve peoplei am really done i dont think its worth it and will avoid delta flights from now on who needs this when there are airlines who actually do have customer service policies|oh sls where do we starti guess ill start from the beginningwhen we checked into our room it was dusty and looked like no one had wiped the room down in a few days understandable if the room had been vacant for awhile but still unacceptable for paying customers we called the front desk and they moved us to another room in the same wingthis room was even worse than the first there was pubic hair yes you read that right pubic hair on the night stand by the bed this time we took all of our bags and headed down to the front desk which if youre ever been to vegas you know was a small journey in itself they moved us to another wing of the hotel and this time the room was clean and much more visually appealing they did not comp any of our nights but offered a  credit and then a  credit the second time it happened the rest of our stay was ok the foxtail pool is nice but it opens late and closes early the standard hotel pool is ok but not very sexy and def not what you would expect if youve ever visited the sls in miami the food at the  hour diner type restaurant wasnt great but wasnt bad the best thing this hotel has going for it is bazaar meat by jose andres its one of the best restaurants ive eaten in vegas the service is exceptional and the food is really memorable but you dont have to stay at the hotel to experience this and i wouldnt ever again when we checked out we had to literally argue with the front desk manager about the credits we received because of the dirty rooms they stuck us with when we first checked in i mean she literally told us they dont give credits for things like that and basically called us our liars my advice stick with aria cosmopolitan or even mgm where you know youll have a clean room great customer service and luxury amenities|mediocre at best i was looking forward to our meal we came at the tail end of happy hour but the restaurant wasnt overly busy we ordered from the happy hour menu  egg roll pork belly steam bau garlic fries spicy wings oysters and carpacio fries came cold  we had to send them back egg rolls and pork bao werent much better drinks were weak  at one point they wanted the martini glass as they had run out  it was about a third full overall the food wasnt that great  we also ordered from the regular menu  pho gau chicken clay pot rice undercooked and sauce very salty the table next to us seemed to be having a better meal  with the owners personally checking in periodically and delivering the food which looked piping hot and a lot better than what we got with food options available i doubt i will come back|the manager treated me as if i was dumb the customer service is horrible but the sandwiches are good|brian is not a good doctor ive been to him about  times now and each time he tells me the same thing but it obliviously isnt working if i keep having to go back do not go to this place|went in for breakfast wasnt very busy  servers working all tables ordered our food and coffee  min later food called for both servers tables us and another table that arrived the same time we did im in the restaurantcustomer service industry and this last part is what gets me the other waitress took the other tables food right to them when she was called our food sat as our waitress was talking and walking around now running a restaurant is a team effort and if you see food sitting regardless if its your table or not run the food dont let it sit for  min and look at us  times and not say anything to the other waitress im not eating cold food i paid for the coffee that was never refilled and walked out will not be back which is unfortunate is they are the new owners of frank food truck and its a small business|just ok nothing to brag about a little pricy for what you get salads are a ripoff if you ask me seems a little on the generic canned frozen side of things not too bad but not to good either there are better places to spend my money|i will give them two stars because the favors we did received were ok this particular store for me was not friendly my first impression of them was  i should be happy that they are even open  they lacked customer service and my order was not fully explained to me i ordered three dozen of their assortment flavors i received probably three of the same flavors  none of the season flavors were included in my order even though my sister received  them in hers a week ago i tried to explain this to the staff and manager but they acted like i was lying why would i lie what do i have to gain anyway this experience was not pleasant and even if the cakes were ok ill stay away for the sake of humility|its very unfortunate that a good establishment goes awry by under and inexperienced staffs servers and chefs without proper supervision  restaurants are half foods and half services in us maybe  in japan so the restaurant may assume the ratio here too  yesterday foods were decent except the cold cheese dish and the colder beef tongue  it was obvious that restaurant was understaffed so we didnt say anything to the servers who kept apologizing for the frequently delayed services  the staffs badly handling of the missing forgotten orders infrequent attentions to customers much needed when busy and the delayed orders among tables is plainly forgivable but the lack of proper supervision tonight  as time went by exacerbated the situation that led ultimately to a loss of our interests on patronage  it was a day before christmas eve i assumed that the restaurant was caught off guard with the unexpected amount of guests thus understaffed but one little wisdom of management in a chaos can save a restaurant from a disaster and from going bust given half the restaurants in las vegas do  i wish they could survive in this highly competitive environment because i like their idea of bringing an authentic izakaya foods to us  but given their foods are decent in order for them to survive their service has to be ironically halfamericanized a friendly but mechanical manner seen at respectable raku or nowgrowingpopularity izakaya go  i really hope they can achieve the balance  well this is my way of giving a complaint after all|this place gave us food poisoningwe went to this place last night and an hour after we left my mother felt sick and started throwing up then  minutes later it hit me worse throw up and ill spare you the details same to my husband and step father we ate something bad we had tiger roll alaska roll poke salad and cucumber island i wish this place would just give us our money back we spent like  just to get sick|a lot a little perturbed i called in initially to ask how much an oils change would be with my car model and was quoted  i was not able to leave given i am traveling and had to have it before i went to work the  is for synthetic oil blend and my car takes only synthetic so it was twice the price i came in at  and didnt get out until almost  two kinds under  and work at am and i cant be late i am beyond upset|this place needs a management team that will require the nursing and doctor staff to operate more efficiently and quicklythere is absolutely no urgency around this office people eating taking personal phone calls having family members come by and conduct personal matters at their place of work and not to mention zero organizationcleanliness is an issue as the floors counters are dirty and medical supplies are left open and uncovered the only positive is that the place was open but honestly a  hour wait and to not even have seen a doctor is absurd this establishment needs to take some pride in their work and provide better care if they cant they need to get out of the industry|ok lets keep it real im white and my hair is already thin as is ive done it all with my hair  sew in weaves tape in clip in glue in you name it ive had itin the past ive purchased my hair from her imports for my sew ins and it used to be great i went a few days ago to get a new bundle to mix with leftover from my previous sew in to create my own clip in extensions i was so disappointed when i got home the hair is already nappy its been  days and i havent even worn them yeti double wefted them before sewing the clips in and they are so incredibly thin it makes me want to cry you can see through them ill be posting a picture i never post a picture  thats how pissed off i am i spent  dollars on this crap hair are you kidding i could have purchased some luxury clip ins at that pricesuch a downgrade at this shop|i was treated so rudely here by dr lehman during my exam and a male employee whose name i didnt get who i asked to adjust my glasses as long as i was thereduring my eye exam i couldnt get two words in without being immediately interrupted by the doctor who also repeatedly asked me if i have any questions because all this information must be confusing it really isnt and that is terribly condescending ive been nearsighted for  years i get exams every year and i understand whats going on at this point he actually explained to me at length what nearsightedness is and how i can tell if i am among a whole host of other lessons in things i already know because i have had my eyes for a while at some point i just stopped responding and let him talk until he got tired since he obviously just wanted someone to lecture for a bit i just needed an eye exam and a prescription not a series of condescending lessons including why i shouldnt sleep in my contacts i dont  but he didnt ask so he wouldnt know he  said again at the end that he didnt mean to overwhelm or confuse me asked if i had any questions and finally took a breath long enough for me to reply nope and get the heck out of therethe employee adjusting my glasses made sure i knew how low quality they are and repeated it several times even though i replied i know they are not nice i dont make a lot of money i finally left with my glasses unadjusted  he seemed to believe he was incapable of adjusting my basic plastic glasses which ive had adjusted twice without complaint or lecture at much nicer placesi could not believe the way they spoke to me and because of it i did not buy contacts or glasses with them ill take my business elsewhere and im extra sorry that my usual optician was booked up during my time in scottsdale so i was stuck with this placethere is one employee who was particularly confident competent kind and professional i think her name was sarah she was quite young and had blonde hair|poor service  guy running register and running food  ppl in kitchen watching you look at your food in the window no personalities what so ever food was so so fries are good burger is ok|dont believe the hype very overpriced for the quality and portions of the dishes i guess rich scottsdale folks dont mind paying  a dish for average chinese food the portions should have been priced at half the amount the menu was limited and small we even preordered the peking duck  and they served it with floor tortillas really they were more like chicken burritos they didnt use rice wraps and it wasnt even that great some of the dishes came to us luke warm they were probably holding them to bring out all at once overall if you never had really good chinese food to compare this too and have the means to pay for overpriced dishes our total bill was  for  people not including tip to be honest the only saving grace was the crab puffs they were good but also over priced the service was also very good they even did sweet and sour chicken with sauce on the side for my picky cousin|nice ambiance and decor with an upscale veneer but no real effort on food preparation waitstaff was exemplary and gratefully recommended the quinoa salad which was the saving grace that evening since they were out of the only grass fed beef veal we decided to pass on the rest of their beef offerings youd understand if youve seen cjdhalibut  la plancha paella style was overcooked dry and flaky the paella had good flavor but was obviously not freshly made pulled porc poutine was not fresh as well fries must have been refried several times they were dry darkened and shrunken cocktails were ok nothing special|i hate to give a bad review but this is one of the worst popeyes ive been too i ordered my food and they told me to pull up because it would take a few minutes i had no issues with this at all  min later they bring me a bag full of food they gave me extras for the wait when i get home i realize they gave me all of this food and none of it was anything i ordered waited  min for a bunch of food i didnt want what makes this even worse a lady that worked here came out to my car and asked me what i ordered and still got it wrong|this gym totally use to be the bomb i dont know what happened but be cautious if signing upthis past summer i had heart surgery that was very difficult to recover from and took longer then expected i made several calls to the gym in an attempt to let them know what was going on and see if i could put my membership on hold or something no one ever called me backthen i had a hysterectomy that the doctor made a mistake on i was home for one day when the gym finally returned my calls after two months and told me i had to cancel my membership in person i even explained what was going on but they didnt care we even wanted to come back as soon as i could walk again but not now i couldnt even walk and they wouldnt help me out my husband was going to take time off work to go in but i ended up back in the hospital that weekend fighting for my life ending up with a second abdomen surgery and another  days in the hospitial gotta love nevada health care right there just simply wasnt time to go in person and they wouldnt even freeze my membership like most gyms will do for youthe entire time our family is dealing with these tragedies my phone is blowing up from late payment notices and so was my emailthey claim to be family oriented but they are not i even sent messages through their website looking for a response and nothingit was simple since theres no contract can i put my account on hold while im dealing with my unexpected health issues then return when i can walk again absolutely not my husband and i are just holding on to all our proof waiting for them to turn it over to collectionsnow im in default and still unable to walk so cant go take care of this yettotally ridiculous  stay away from here i would recommend sticking with the other gyms they seem to have less turn over and be more member friendly|ive been coming here for a few months and a new lady did my eyebrows today not only was she chewing her gum with her mouth open but she was also was popping it all in my ear while threading my eyebrows to top it off ive been working on getting my eye brows thick again and she thin them out while leaving them uneven i had to ask her to fix them|not great forgot to give me a lot of items in my to go order flavor leaves a lot to be desired as well|will never go to a car mike digiplex movie theater ever again i will never recommend any of my friends or family to this place either  mins into the my first time watching star wars some kid from the theater comes in saying we have to restart the movie since not everyone saw the previews when did this become a thing the movie starts at a certain time and therefore people should be there at a certain time this prolonged everything and completely ruined everyones movie experience when other members of the audience asked why are we restarting it we already watched the previews the staff remarked smugly  because not everyone got to see the previews almost as if he was annoyed of the questioni have never been so disappointed with a movie experience definitely will never go here again if youre looking for a uninterrupted movie experience goto amc or harkins but never choose this place as they will most likely destroy  your movie experience|awful service  so so so  food adrian the server was the reason for  star really gave us hard time trying to enjoy this place no more words no good never will come again|it was my full intent to go to fruition lv on this trip not only to score some nice gear but to see sammy jo and nembut i didnt make ita reviewer mentioned that you could grab some nice stuff here at be and be way ahead of the game as opposed to the more pricey stuff at fruitionive been to consignment shops before and this one was reminiscent of nvision down in cincinnati northside  in fact i think nvision is nicer than be mainly because they had more vintage and classy items whereas be leaned more towards trendy stuffi did pick up a really fly true religion bomber that still had the original tags on it  it was discounted damn near   i hit a lick on that oneas with all things its pretty much about personal taste and style at a consignment shop im squeamish about consignmentbut i got a hella deal this timebemehits just okay  to me at least|i do not come here sticks for sushi should ask no cups for ice cream sushi just disgusting it is the worst sushi i have ever eaten sushi with mayonnaise and very spice hot|the decorations were amazing but there were way toomany men way too many too small nye will be a sausage fest  and you smell cigarettes everywhere women you will stink|horrible service|the food is pretty good however the server tom was a bit disconnected  not attentive and borderline rude greeting tables next to my party but barely making any contact with us we waited for straws and went most of our meal without any refills food is good but management needs to up the ante on their employee customer service expectations|im new to this  hope my experience keeps me true to this i was given a business card for this location it appeared to be far away i had a conversation with josh   he  walked me thru  what i wasnt sure of he made me feel comfortable   assured me in many ways this is the dispensary i want my  business with he answered all my questions i will spread the word thanks josh i was brousin in yelp euphoria needs no help with  reviews  restaurants dont get reviews like this personality means so much  a lot you go josh|of course you cant rely on the people of scottsdale on their yelp reviews sad anyway on to the my review ordered regular philly roll with miso soup both bland and something i wouldnt go back to  which glad i didnt looks like nori sushi has  food violations according to cbs  newshttpwwwcbsazcomstorydirtydiningdectwovalleyrestaurantshavehealthcodeviolations|just dont   average food no creativity baked items appear brought in  for the price they should at least appear to make an effort a disappointment|waited  hour for the food and then finally started getting the items in every  mins intervals had to remind them about the orders again and againthe same pattern was for every dinner tablevery disappointed by the service|ive called this location about  times already during business hours and nobody answered the phone i highly doubt they are that busy|i guess i didnt have a typical experience compared to the rest of the reviews on here  it is a little expensive but the portions are huge  my friend got pad thai that was so sour it was inedible  when we told the server she went to the kitchen came back out and said thats how it was supposed to taste  we repeated it was too sour but didnt order a replacement since they thought it was us that didnt understand how pad thai was supposed to taste  at that point we didnt feel like we could trust whatever the cook would send back out  i have no reason to believe they would add any special sauce to a replacement hopefully edible entree but being challenged at the complaint didnt offer peace of mind   since the portions are so big we split the other order happy family and it was plenty  left the pad thai on the table  at checkout they gave  off which i just laughed at  i can accept the mistake just too much vinegar but the  off was a joke  they should have taken the inedible food back done it right and not questioned it  they made us feel like the problem was us not their food  the chicken didnt taste fresh in the happy family but the broccoli was fine  they dont have a liquor license  no reason for me to ever return|love the pizza and love the price but i am not happy that you have to give them your credit card information on the phone for a pick up order they should offer a safer way of paying|ive tried this place several times and each time im very disappointed overpriced food that is under cooked and overdressed when you order a dish with salmon and quinoa and vegetables they bring you your salmon in a cup which i think is ridiculous staff is careless doesnt pay attention this place needs a lot of help if i were you i wouldnt even bother going|tagged along with family as they dropped by here to get gingerbread cookies  my sister apparently likes this placethe interior of the store is quite nice i remember the lighting being very soft and flattering  there is quite a bit of food merchandise pancake mix candy gift baskets and weirdly a display nook of costume jewelry and a handbag  they also have very large pastry case displays filled with goodies  i do think the baked goods look too perfect and mass produced though this was a red flag  the cashier was pleasantwhile family members seemed to enjoy the treats i found them lacking  the gingerbread man with chocolate pants a detail family enjoyed had a very dry texture and was somewhat dog biscuitlike very bland and crumbly  the peppermint brownie was half frosting chocolate frosting over peppermint frostingcreme over a chocolate chip brownie which attempted to distract from the fact that the brownie itself was on the dry side but it didnt make up for the loss of brownie gooeynessi wont seek this place out again but i would veto it for lunch either  we really need a highquality bakery cafe to replace the panerafied and bastardized paradise bakery|sorry to do this because i was a regular customer that came in every  weeks for months and then stopped after an incident  months ago i always booked an appt with the same nail technician and because she was the only one available most of the time she was working on someone during my appt time there was a time i waited almost an hour and i had booked an appt i went and said something to the man at the desk about this and was going to leave because i dont see the point of making appts and you know i come every  weeks that you would book her during my time slot ive also witnessed that they just want to fill the seats in there regardless if theres enough people to assist them so youre sitting there soaking your feet or just waiting on someone to help you i rather they tell customers a time frame so they can make an informed decision on if they want to wait or not after the long wait the man at the desk did offer me a  discount for the inconvenience but i was done with the place this wasnt the first time it has happened and i made sure it was the last i decided to go back to the place i went to before since they are more honest with time frames and appreciate customers time the place is nice and relaxing if you can just sit there and relax without someone coming asking you various questions while at the shop im hoping by now they have gotten a lot better with their time management|it may have been wrong time of the year and the chef on vacation but service was awful and the food even worse i ordered spaghetti meatballs and the sauce was directly of the can and meatballs cold and dry tasted like old falafel  i wish i could give one more star for the view but the view couldnt make up for the horrible food|totally agree with michelle gs review  i had botox on  and have no results  days later  that has never happened to me before  i have left messages for them and have received no call back  they clearly are not using authentic botox or they are using less than the amount paid for  do not recommend|cafe rio is basically a clone of chipotle the place is clean the service is mediocre and the food is overpriced  blandthe best item they have is the sweet pulled pork  the chicken has zero flavor my issues with the service were thus we arrived over an hour before closing and i ordered the pork burrito they was about a  of a serving of pork left in the bin and if i hadnt been watching that is all the kid would have put in my burrito he scraped the bin to get every last bit for me but it was still not even half the meat they should be using so he offered to replace the remaining meat with chicken and i unwisely agreed he didnt drain the soggy wet chicken at all  so the result was a burrito in a tinfoil pan that was basically a soup at the bottom forget about actually picking up the burrito to eat with your hands like anywhere else you had to use fork and knife and could have switched to a spoon by the end it was pretty disgusting  all that wet tortilla and soggy meats on top of that the chicken had zero flavor not even salt seasoning taste the pork was flavorful but i only got the tiniest hint of it maybe two bites the black beans were equally bland with zero flavor and no seasoning i didnt mind the rice however and was glad it wasnt the typical spanish rice with nothing but cumin seasoning but for  the rice isnt going to cut it when everything else was a major disappointment the burrito was a total fail my girlfriend got the pork tacos and thought they were good  she obviously chose wisely and also got all the pork and left none for me lol but to run out of your signature meat over an hour before closing thats just bad kitchen management then on top of all that i had a real craving for chips and queso  and they were offered on the menu and i ordered them it wasnt until we were paying that we were informed that they do not have any chips and cannot fulfill our entire order they couldnt say that earlier they couldnt put up a note on the wall menu  out of chips common courtesy to your guests before they waste time standing in line and actually place an order i did not want to dine there if we couldnt get the chips i wanted we would have gone elsewhere  so it was pretty unethical of them to get me to the very end before letting me know i am not getting what i wanted to pay for that is bad customer service especially if you are expecting a guest to return now i dont want to ever go back there whereas i probably would have if they told me no pork no chips and we went elsewhere and took a rain check on cafe rio its only fair and good business practice the other thing that really bothered me was while our food was being prepared one of the workers i will assume the manager because he had a really arrogant attitude was berating a younger worker for putting too much cheese on our food he kept telling him to place less ingredients into our meal excuse me please try to be a cheap bastard while the customer is not right in front of you that is incredibly unprofessional and also showed how stingy this place is going to be every time basically the staff itself showed me that the food there is not a good value for the price you pay i appreciate the concept of this place and even making tortillas from scratch is great but if you are going to cheat the customer out of proteins and cheese have completely bland chicken and beans not be able to competently put a proper burrito together and not be honest about your menu  you arent going to get any return business taco senor is about  minutes away and blows this place out of the water with their tasty food amazing prices and terrific service no comparison go to taco senor instead of lame cafe rio this place is for unsuspecting people with no taste buds|stop by for a quick dinner last night even though i have not heard good things about panera we thought we would give it a try my husband and i got and steak and cheese panini kids got a ham and cheese and the husband also got a soup the kids sandwhichs were just ok how can you go wrong with plain ham which helped them get the one star and i will say also that the employees were very friendly however my husband and i sandwhichs were inedible the meat was so tuff you could not bite through it i ended up just throwing mine awayi have heard that all paradise bakerys will eventually switch over to panera which makes me very sad because it is definitely not the same|ordered the tomato and egg and got it dumped in front of me without a word said the dish had barely any veggies and all werent at all bite size i only had a few bites before asking for the bill and although it was clear that i didnt like the plate nothing was mentioned when i asked for the bill also i got a laugh out of asking for vegetarian option ramen and answered only if animal broth would be okay  |great service awful food got the carnitas tacos tortillas were very hard also got the guacamole which had no flavor margaritas were great and so were the waiters but nothing near authentic mexican food two stars for the service and margaritas but thats about it|food was decent but i pulled a long hair out of my mouth after sippingon a gin cocktail and we waited an hour and  min for our food while others that arrived  and even  min after us were served their food will not go back|they wrre closing early because of christmas  eveno problem  but checker pauly c rude because i didnt know they only took cash or debit cards not impressed with staff of storewill not shop there any longer and will advise other family members  and friends  to shop elsewhere  as well  never had a rude employee  like that at any store|this place puts more effort into its image than it puts into its food and charges you more for it its not that the food tastes bad its just that it isnt great kind of like a warmed over fancy frozen dinner with extra garnish the people working there were very nice and attentive then again there werent many other customers to worry about|well we should of payed more attention to the awful reviews prior to this  yes we had a terrible experience  when we entered the restaurant there was no one except for us there there must of been without kidding  plus employees having their own party among themselves a massive amount of chicken already prepared ready for the dinner rush and getting cold as it lay  we both ordered my husband wanting to try their new peppered chicken what a joke his was less hot then my mild chicken tenders he had to add louisana hot sauce to make it alittle spiceythe restaurant was freezing we both wore our jackets the whole time we were there it was by far warmer outdoors we mentioned it to a couple people in the back the only answer we got was that was why they were dressed for a blizzard  no concern whatsoevermy husband mentioned about the chicken with no different taste then the regular tenders mild at that oh well thats how they comewhatmy tenders were luke warm at best when i recieved them  i just ate them we were alreadyupset that we chose this place instead of just any other  at this point so upsetso take my advicelook at all these  star reviews before you enterchoose another any other i might addeating choice|eh disorganized operation the staff are all wonderful but their pet boarding is another story i called to make a reservation for pet boarding about a month before thanksgiving asked the nice girl if they would be closing early the day before thanksgiving or if normal drop off times were ok she said that they would be open during normal business hours  luckily we arrived at  that day to drop off the dogs because they closed at  and just still open due to some surgeries that were getting out a little later than expected  would have been really upset and had some issues with our planned trip if we had gotten there a few minutes later they didnt even call to confirm the reservation or to warn of closing earlier due to the holiday strike  today is christmas eve and again i have reservations to drop my dogs off for a couple of nights  confirmed this one during thanksgiving and was told they would be closing around  so to just bring them before closing time  i just called  pm and was told that i was forwarded to their after hours answering service and to call back later because the office is closed i asked what time they closed today and was told pm awesome  thank goodness i was calling to cancel instead of just arriving to drop them off  strike  the only reason its a  star vs  is because their staff is amazingly kind  they are a very smiley bunch and i truly believe they want to be there caring for pets they just need better systems management in place so if youre boarding you are reminded of their closing times and provided accurate information at least  hours beforehand will likely not go back for their rd strike|the search for the best kbbq in lv continuesafter my friend heard about this place on npr and seeing so many great reviews my friends and i made the long trek out to henderson in search of some great ayce all you can eat kbbq  unfortunately this did not end up being the mecca of kbbq we had hoped it to befirstly the decor was weird it was very modern and young like it was trying to cater to kpop teenage fans or something it was also way too clean to be authenticif i cant smell the bbq thats not a good signsecond the bbq was only ok at least they had bulgogisteakpork belly spicy porkbut they didnt have galbilike no marinated bone in short ribs in sight what also the portion sizes when they came out were kinda smallbut i guess since its ayce it doesnt really matter i will say that the jap chae noodles were garlicky and delicious and i may have ordered like  plates of it  also for pp its a good deal  finally the service was horrible i mean who are you hiring gen high schoolers these kids had no idea what was going on told really oddweirdinappropriate jokes forgot to bring us multiple items sauces ordered meats water and honestly didnt listen to us half the time when we asked about items on the menu for exampleus what is the difference between the premium pork and the regular porkwaiter stares at us then walks awayum you could have even just said i dont know but dont just ignore us  shakes my headget it together gen its like amateur hour here|terribletiny burritos at huge prices no flavoring they also forgot our order and we had to inquire as to the status really the only positive experience was using the clean restroomi ate three burritos and my lady friend had two no hot saucego elsewhere|i like trying new pizza places as im always on the hunt for the best recieved their menu on front door and read try our pizza one time youll want it everytime ordered a hawaiian pizza for delivery worst hawaiian pizza ive ever had very little pineapple and the ham was lightly scattered in micro pieces that one could not even taste the menu is now in my recycleing bin with yesterdays newspaper|ive called numerous times and they never pick up their phone id be nice since people like to order to go often|not good at all whose idea was it to replace popeyes with this place the waffle fries were crispy and drenched in grease and the tasteless chicken was also drenched how does a chicken place run out of breasts and ketchup|this was the old kribles  bakery    taken over  about    yr  ago i   had  gotten some cookies   from them to  check  them out   over  months ago they were   just like kribles  cookies so i  assumed   the cakes would be

server didnt bring water refill or ask if i cared for sugar when the latte was brought out our breakfast was overpriced for what we got i appreciate the local sourcing and the organic gmo free food

delicious breakfast and good service i dont go there any other times than breakfast thoughcraftkitchen wouldve been better if the service was higher grade|first time ever to visit a freddys and the

ive ever had  bites and gave the rest to the dogs i dislike mcds but would go their before setting foot in this place again|considering it is a korean restaurant not the best in town many people order the pork cutlet because it will only fill you up at a decent student price the side soup should be warm but its cold kimchi should be fresh and cold but it taste like its been outside for hours other options are not recommended because when they come out they are not hot like they should be also i feel the employees are not fully trained to take the order extremely disappointed|worst dining experience in a dennys my family and i have ever experienced we waited an hour and half for our food and they werent even packed thats unexceptable we understand its christmas eve and all but as a resturant chain you should be prepared for anythingthe hostess working there has no buisness working she was lazy and there were alot of tables waiting to be bused and she just looked at them like they werent her problem i give them  star because the waitress was trying her best to get us our food out as soon as she could|great atmosphere  for a pint of adult root beer is kind of ridiculous considering san tan and wilderness brewery are right down the street and have lunch specials  for an over cooked burger and adult root beer at lunch noon disappointed since we work down the street and

place  chances and every visit seemed worse than the previous the service is awful and the food quality is comparable to a dive bar i only ordered wings and the queso dip and the wings came out almost an hour after i ordered them and the queso took even longer to come out i definitely suggest oreganos across the street|really disappointed right now my family of   visits bww at least once a week service in house is great buttonight we decided to order take out for the second time since they opened and for the second time they have forgotten things i have paid for granted i sent my husband to get the order so he didnt check what was in the bag but it just really bothers me that he even has to do that if i pay extra for sides or food then it should be the checkouts responsibility to make sure everything that is on the reciept is in the bag the first time i let it go because like i said normally always get decent service but i paid for this a second time and didnt get what i paid for thanks for the dinner i wont even get to eat now|got seated in the dining area quickly because it was slow waited  minutes and the waiter never came  other groups were seated close by and they ended

detest this company  joined with a free trial membership  at time of joining was convinced to buy  membership for  months  was also told i get free  gift certificate at restaurantcom the very next day i get bj email offering cheaper membership than i had paid also come to find i need to spend  to save  but at restaurants nowhere close to home  i try calling bjs and wait over  minutes on hold  no

nice  unfortunately there were a few very important things that caused this stay to be a bad experience for our tripthe valet service is horrible  dangerous  when arriving back to the hotel on saturday nightsunday morning as we were pulling in one of the valet men came speeding out of the garage full speed and almost hit our car  he didnt apologize or even acknowledge almost doing it  we had to slam on our breaks so hard it shifted many things around in the car and screeched the tires  when checking out of the hotel on sunday morning our car which was a rental car might i add had the fresh smell of cigarette smoke in it as if someone had been smoking and put out their cigarette as they were getting in the car and blew the smoke in the car  we had to roll the windows down in the very cold weather to get the stench out on the way to the airport  the same valet man gave us wrong directions to the airport sending us north of charlotte  luckily i was somewhat familiar with the area and could tell that we werent going the right way and turned us around  this however made me have to get more gas in the car  which we had prepaid for gas and had it set to deliver it back very close to empty  instead i had to pay for more gas to ensure that we didnt run out because of the  miles off track we were  also this made us almost miss our flight  thankfully security was moving people fairly fast on sunday  when i have tried to contact valet management i continue to get voicemail  i tried to speak with one of the hotel managers but the operator kept sending me to a answering machine  after a while i finally told the operator i want to speak to a frigging manager  quit sending me to voicemail  however  after saying this she transferred me to a lady who answered saying  hello  this is one of the fing managers  hows your day in a very smirky tone  finally after emailing the man that continues to ask that people on this site email him directly with their issues about all of this i never received any sort of reply|i was looking for a clarisonic brush and was practically bullied buy a clinique lady to get the clinique version it was sub par and i returned it anyways

mean|i had my suspicions when i was the only person at the restaurant when i got there but its between semesters so perhaps that was why it was slow i thought i had a margarita and a mexican shrimp cocktail the margarita was so disgusting i had to add eight packets of sugar just to make it palatable when the shrimp cocktail arrived i noticed the sauce had a sourbitter taste that its not supposed to have it seemed almost fermented like it was expired the shrimp had a funny skin on it that ive never seen on shrimp before may have been the result of freezer burn but it also tasted funny against my better judgment i ate my shrimp cocktail  but my worst fears were confirmed later in the evening when i developed food poisoning avoid|you are a bank and dont even carry   how is that even possible

back  spend your money elsewhere somewhere were they treat customers and employees with common courtesy and respect  also the smell of chemicals was overpowering  poor ventilation|we had an air conditioner installed in sept  from home depot our electric bill never decreased as promised since we were purchasing a dual compressor unit and many times our home never cooled in summer time we have had the unit serviced by the company that home depot warranty requires and have had issue with this company as well putting a hole in our ceiling b y being careless not keeping an appt and not recognizing that the dual unit was never hooked up only one pump has worked  the smaller since day  the issue was brought to our attention as we had enough of orangutan warranty service co and called our own recommended company who stated that the unit was never installed properly and they cannot fix because wires were never run from the larger pump we were disgusted that home depot company never mentioned to us and after much communication over the last month i was denied that home depot would repair they knew from the initial conversation that another company discovered the negligence and denied because someone else touched the unit they never have offered for anyone to come inspect the resolution expert elaine bryant was made aware that this other company touched the unit to offer a fix to home depots neglect and based off this my claim was denied|originally booked shuttle from mesa gateway airport to my home in san tan valley booked and paid return trip received confirmation of

a refund on the ticket i was just saying my butt wasnt going to be in the seat on the bellingham flight that i had already paid for customer service was incredibly rude and unhelpful by the time i got off the phone with them it was too late to make the connection and i had to pay almost  extra to rebook the return flights it was insane and illogical while this is not a reflection of the entire flight crew twice ive encountered rude and demeaning flight attendants or ticket counter employees which has tainted my experience as a whole ill be sticking to southwest from here on out a cheap flight is not worth the hassle and bad attitudes|if you want bland burgers lousy service and to be told that you are wrong go to keegans and speak with the manager alex not only will he tell you that

this cafe for a long time now and was happy with the service i also would go in the mornings before i went to school but then a crisis happened and i got stranded at the bashes complex were the gecko expresso is located at of corse i was freaked so i sat inside the bashes and got a drink in the new starbucks they had recently opened but then i remembered that the gecko expresso was just over there i also finally got a hold of a ride and they told me to stay at gecko expresso where they could find me i went over there to buy a muffin and when i went to sit down there was an employee sitting and chatting with a person i dont know who she was but then the manger or so she screamed at me to move the premises so i calmly did so left and sat i front of her place in the road so the people trying to find me could the manger kept screaming at me you should also know that i am a female  year old and student who had also been freaked out thinking someone close to myself had died or been in a car accident she told me and i quote to get the hell off her property and that there were chairs on the other side were i could sit i tried to explain to her i was a costumer who came to her store often and i would never come after this she kept insisting that shes never seen me before in her life which is an outright lie i have been to her store more times than i can count which i also told her to

half of it since he abandoned this dog and four others as well as a cat ten months earlier he was a bad pet owner so they were better off with me i had told them that it was my dog then i gave it to him when we were still together because the dog preferred men a five pound chi that i found on the side of the road they called him at work and he hung up on them they told me he called back but would not take a break from work to get his credit card i paid for the eye to be secure eight hundred dollars the next day i went to pick him up and they told me to wait in the room i waited for about forty minutes and then they told me to leave i said i am waiting for my dog they told me that i said it was his dogi said yes ten months ago but he just left him and i only have his number i dont know where he is they told me he would pay for it and i will get a refund on my credit card  when i had came in they had said he had not even called them back yet about the dog they also told me that i was supposed to come in at eleven not nine funny cuz they told me that they close at eleven and if i did that i would not have been able to pick him up anyway i left called my ex up and all he could do was laugh i then got a call from this place two days later asking me how my dog was wtf then i got a call from the vet or owner asking me for my credit card info to issue a refund when i did get a refund they seriously did something illegal and unethical for a business to do they issued a credit for a cat i had brought in two years earlier and not the dog i had brought in they changed the pet i brought in the date i brought it in and the amount it had cost it had not cost eight hundred dollars for this cat to get some antibiotics or for whatever it was for i cant remember because the receipt didnt say why the animal was brought inonly the updated date cost and animals name the funny thing was it was the cat that he had abandoned he had it for two years before i met him who is taking care of him now not him who pays the vet bills food and other thingsnot himbut yet they give him a dog he had lost that dog four times when i was with him and would put him on the island in the kitchen and go to sleep and leave him there for six hours im sure you can see why he needed to leave now i have the son and daughter of the dog and he misses his dad very much he had refused to fix his dog because it would no longer be a male dogwtf the dogs name is joey but yet he has no idea whyhow can this be allowed to happen  i wish they would respond to this because they will not respond to calls

takes a minute as i used to work for walgreens she said yes i was walking around for about  minutes when i finally walked up to the front to see if it was done as she had not called my name the team lead was up front now and informed me that the girl never released the order so it had not even started yet once it began they did not seem to know that you have to switch out the cd when the first one is full  minutes later they still did not have my order done i was so patient and understanding but i reached my limit i had to leave and asked that they call me when the order was done good thing i didnt hold my breath as  hours later i still havent heard from them the lead was kind enough to give me a discount but honestly it does not make up for their incompetence and the hour of my day that i lost i would not recommend this location of you have something important you need work on|went there last night with my family and the food court was a disaster even though it was not busy tables

couple other people that work at atlas they never returned calls and nothing ever got fixed we dealt with a backed up sewageplumbing issue the entire time we lived there it was disgusting to say the least worst part of the experience is that we had so much patience through all of this and they refused to give us back a penny of our deposit and havent supplied us with an itemized receipt have no idea where the money went to repairs that existed when we moved in we will see them in court good thing we carefully filled out damage forms when we moved in|i remember eating here a few years back

dealership is horrible i had the unfortunate experience of working with a mr freddy kourey he is full of shit he sold me a preowned  pt cruiser with  miles upon buying the car i was told it had no accidents and  previous owner after having the car for  months i traded it in for a new  hyandai elantra and was told it had  previous owners and one major collision in  he also lied about it being a certified preowned car  weeks into having the car the radiator broke please do not buy from this dealership we all know dealerships try to get the most money they can but this was absolutely out of control|took my husband here because hes had this weird cough for months now the doctor acted like he could care less told my husband to have a sleep test done didnt even bother looking at him to see

and would call back and never did|the food was okay but i sat at the bar and my service was terrible i had to ask for chips and salsa  times i got my food before my chips i asked them to make fajitas spicy and for some reason it was sweet wtfi asked for hot sauce and did not get it until a waiter that was cashing out noticed and brought it to me i tipped that waiter that who was nice enough to take care of me  times more than my actual waiter|i would never shop at copps except that is the only close by grocery store over and over again their fresh produce is covered in mold meat had to be

porta salad for a party of  to pick up at a designated time and it  wasnt ready when we got there to pick it up  didnt include dressing and  was  ridiculous|between two days i spent a total of  hours at this store trying to buy a phone for me and my wife the first day i spent  hours waiting before anyone even acknowledged my existence even though there were associates in the department twiddling their thumbs and chatting it up finally i was able to get connected with an associate who in the end quoted xmonth for an iphone s plus only to send me out the door with the wrong phone a regular  plus when i realized he had made a mistake i returned to the store only to be there for another  hours and when i explained the mistake they made regina one of the department managers refused to admit any error on their end and also refused to do anything about the mistake i resulted in returning the phone and going straight to att where i was given excellent service a consumer should not have to wait  hours and then be treated like a liar this is the worst customer service experience ive ever had regina if you read this i hope you realize that you should not be at all comfortable with the level of service you and your department offers and you genuinely need to take a look at how you have run a valuable consumer out the door i will never step foot in this store again|we went here the other night and ordered the hibachi dinner for two but they were out of filet mignon to upgrade the chef didnt do any of the usual hibachi tricks other than the onion volcano the food was just ok the meat wasnt seasoned at all and the hibachi soup was overly salty the service was also very slow overall we werent impressed with this place and probably wont be back|ate a hamburger there and was tossing my cookies two hours later should have known from the poor taste that it was going to cause problems nothing like some food poisoning at a dive bar tiny salad served with it after two dollar up charge tvs are small just regular tvs not even as big as those in my kids room|stay away they had a dyson unit i dropped of for over  months no call no updates would try to call and could never reach anyone when i finally stopped in i heard the same story from  months ago that he was waiting on parts from australia are the parts swimming over i asked when we can expect the parts to arrive he responded when they get here are you kidding me  months later and thats how you respond to a customer when i see the sad state of this business i know why do yourself a favor and find another vendor|my mom and i recently purchased a bucket of chicken with sides at this kfc for dinner needless to say i wasnt too impressed with the food or service after pulling up to the drive thru window we ended up having to wait there was no line for  minutes before the gal working there asked us if we needed help the food cost us nearly  for the family meal when we got home and started eating i realized that we didnt get any butter for our biscuits also the mac and cheese had a weird flavor in it almost like it had been sitting for a while or something im not sure the mashed potatoes werent very good either very salty the chicken while not terrible was certainly nothing to write home about ive experienced better for sure slow service and below average food for us at this kfc star place in my view|never had a problem with this place until tonight my husband and i went in and ordered our usual bow tie pasta with cheese sauce our waiter jose was obviously annoyed with us that we didnt want appetizers by his tone and the look on his face he then proceeded to question my order like hes never heard of it before but in a very rude way he didnt offer us any wine when we sat down or grated cheese with our meal the manager wound up bringing our food out and refilling our drinks for us jose didnt have but  tables of which we were one and he was laughing and talking with the table next to us so he wasnt having a bad day he just seemed to be really annoyed by having to be our server my husband thinks it may be because his other  tables were older people who looked like they ordered a full course meal my husband and i are in our twenties so maybe he just thought of us as kids at least that is very much how he treated us i was a server for  years and i would have never thought to treat a customer that way my husband almost said something to the manager but i didnt want to get the server into trouble since its christmas tomorrow regardless we were so disappointed and just felt very snubbed if we do return which wont be likely we will certainly request someone other than jose|i wish i could give this place less stars  dirty upon arrival and very rude made us feel like we were an inconvenience to them im a diabetic and it started with my simple statement because the tub could make you lose a limb for fs sake  we discussed it  this was a gift from a friend and we wanted to sit together during pedi that was an issue and this place was empty i think d got the point but not really she asked me how my day was and where i was from i told her san diego and that was a bit stressed from our car breaking down and having to rent a car holidays and car rental  im broke but im very kind and asked her questions to see if she was troubled not at all  i read people

lots of issues with the games not working and not giving tickets out|first off the food is good  certainly better breakfast fare than any of the frqnchise places  the quality of food is not the issuefor  minutes i was completely ignored by the waiting staff  no orders in nothing  i dont care how good the food is  when the waiting staff doesnt even come by to take the order theres a serious problemwhen youre a minority and waiting for that  minutes and you see  other tables who arrived after you getting orders in while you just sit there theres a serious problem  i heard ill be there in a minute several times but i pretty much had it after the th time i flagged a waiting staff down and heard the same thingso disappointed because the food is actually good  but i dont take such insults too well|slowest place on earth  people standing doing nothing while one person makes drinks consistently like this dont come here while in a hurry|the water was the best part of the meal  egg drop soup looked like it was campbell chicken soup and they added some items to and the egg roll was soggy and burnt didnt know that was even possible  the kung pao chicken was flavorless which is an amazing feet to achieve  if you want asian food head one mile south to las thai cuisine  they at least wont burn the food|went in for lunch to check out the place yelp claimed  stars atmosphere was okay had radio on pop playing a bit loud  so just an american ambiance the restaurant wasnt busy for lunchtime though ordered pad thai chicken lunch plate the eggroll was barely warm but burned saturated with oil and had no flavor it obviously had been precooked and sitting around waitingfor some time the fried rice was horrendous no flavor at all and mushy was this asian food really  the pad thai chicken had no flavor and the noodles for too thin and mushy oh and the soup had hot and sour soup  it was atrocious sweet and like jelly maybe that is the fusion they are talking about  i told the waiter when asked how it was okay as we had just started and he said oh my husbands food was equally horrific if not worse we left most of the meal on the plate when we left and no one cared to ask if you want bland fast food type american food then this is the place for you but honestly go elsewhere|i just watched their multiple security men punch and kick a man who was unable to protect himself if the person has submitted he doesnt deserve to be abused by your security they only stopped because i started to videotape them|how this place has these reviews is beyond me its a small bar no character food was terrible the kind of nachos id expect to get in polandawful avoid|talk about extremes  this can be the best food or the worst food and there seems to be no middle ground i have had ify food there beforebut today was a new lowthe service was so bad i wont even comment  then the food the chips were actually chewy and i mean really so chewy my teeth stuck togetherno fooling   they were   greasy and undercookednever had that before and the green chile was cold overcooked and i had to look to find thatmeanwhile the tortillas in the enchilada were so soaked in juice from the missing chile that they were very soggythe rice was soaked with the juice from large chunks of tomato  so it flavored like something between hot tomatoes  and cold rice with cheese it was just flat bad foodand the place was full goes to show you  i have had some of the best chile in all arizona at this place  these folks hail from the socorrohatch new mexico area  so they know what is right but not todayi tried to speak with the waiter that went no wheremy stomach was so upset by the time i left that i it will be a long time before i go back there againvery upsetting because when the owner is paying attentionit cant be beat wakeup over there|used to do the flying chicken drive through apparently they changed their policy and will not allow french fries to be sold to go i asked for a manager and she too refused to sell them my son is  i tell her and i promise he wont decide to review the fries she refused fries wont get a review but the poor service will adios so many other places to eat|my husband and i came here for our anniversary the food was good as always the service was good until checkout  then they charged another tables bill and our bill to our card so now my car payment is late because the money wont get put back into monday credit where credit is due they did not argue with giving it the money back buy they didnt seem to care about the inconvenience of it all it seemed like they didnt really care at all to be honest like it happens often or something  i dunno if ill go back or not|the pizza is okie dont get me wrong just wished they were bigger for the price you paythe squash soup is very good|we visited scottsdale village square before having my dad taken there for skilled nursing following a hospital visit the staff was very nice and capable the facility was nice the afternoon of my dads transport we were called and told my dad would be placed in the dementia rehab no further comments were made we found my dad in long term dementia rehab this is the part of scottsdale village square no one showed us when we were touring the therapists are wonderful dr nagel is very easy to work with the nurse was very pleasant the  accommodations at scottsdale village square long term dementia is not a place anyone would want to place a loved one they are very runned down no soap in the bathroom we were told they go into another room for their soap  it is completely understaffed many people calling out for help there were  people in one room many making incoherent requests to the too few people we saw helping when we wanted to see my dads room his pillows were on the floor dresser was broken his clothes had been there for  hours  were found on the floor my dad was in a secured room his bathroom was connected to another room  not secured i dont think one of the care providers at this location would place their loved one in this part of scottsdale village squaresaddened by the switch and bate deception used in this facilitythe kicker here my dad has never been diagnosed with dementia deb in scottsdale|whoa trader joes  just spent  plus in your store cashiers were downright hostile so rude  long drawn out conversation with

 merry christmas|decided to try something new tonight so we ordered takeout here the girl who took the order over the phone was very helpful and nice but unfortunately the food was so bland chicken teriyaki was pretty much grilled chicken tossed in the sauce vegetable chow mein was decent cheese puffs tasted like plain cream chz in a soft puff felt like it was over priced|i have tried going to this place repetedly and always feel like i am a criminal well the other day i was there killing some time prior to starting my shift at work  i bought a few items and i inadvertantly stuck a pair of sun glasses on my head and when i went to check out instead of the lady asking me about a two dollar pair of glass on my head she rang me up and i paid the  that my item cost only to find a man in my face telling me and every one else in the store what a piece of shit shop lifter i was he the grabed my purse from me and dumped it on the floor and when i went to pick it up he grabed me sooo hard he brought tears to my eyes it hurt real bad  now let me explaine to you i have a blood disorder and once i start bleeding it is hard to get it to stop i tried explaining this to the man only to ge insulted some more he was very unprofessional about the whole ordeal and i even offered to pay for not only the sun glasses but ant losses he may had encoured due to my neglagents i was in no way there to steal anything  i know what i did was wring and i feel i was being very cooperative when the police got there he told them i was out of control and the i was being very uncoopertive and that he wanted me arested he also stated the fact that i had taken some medication and did not show him my prescription i did not know that i was not allowed to take my meds when i need the i may of bleed out with out taking them cause they clot me blood when i start bleedeing i will be pursuing this matter in a court if law due to the fact i have a big bruise on my arm where he graped me and as i do landscaping for a living i can harly move me aem this morning thats how hard he grabed me|psimo servicio a parte nica ponen salsa de tomate en las rdenes para llevar y si fuera poco siempre se equivocan en los pedido  psimo es poco cochinero de servicio|their lady security guard is very rude she would not allow me to grab a shopping cart per her words she said  these are not for you|tsa was the problem again hundreds of people in the security line and only one lane for pre check and one lane for everyone else finally after about  minutes they opened a second lane you would think they would have opened all lanes considering the amount of people waiting they had dozens of staff members standing around chit chatting with each other|i am extremely dissatisfied and offended at the service i received at this hr fitness location i had been thinking of switching memberships to hr fitness and received an invite from a friend to come play basketball and test out the gym so i went online applied for a free day pass and received one upon arrival i presented my pass and was halted until mike the manager arrived mike then proceeded to ask me what i would be using the day pass for today and i replied play basketball with a few friends then workout mike then told me that the basketball court was only for members and that my options for playing would be to join right now or pay for a day pass i said i have a day pass right here and no where on it does it say it limits me to any section of the gym he then replies it says restrictions applies in the fine printwhich was a lie i say ok how much is the other day pass then and he says  at this point i am very upset and say no way am i paying that just to play basketball for one day he then goes on to say its because we dont want our members waiting in line to play behind non membersthere were literally only  people on the court and also there was a lot of fighting in the past and it was only people who were not members so thats why corporate made this rule i was a member of hr fitness in centennial hills previously and never did i hear any such rules i feel like mikes story was complete bs and that if i were of any other race i would have been able to test out the entire gym freely as my day pass granted me to do thats what he made me feel like through his tones and looks of contempt needless to say i will never go back to this gym and hour fitness can forget about me ever becoming a member here|larrys meats not owned by larry anymore and it shows ordered a prime rib  weeks early for christmas dinner paid the deposit and waited until wednesday  to pick it up they asked if i could come around  pm and i was happy to make it happen when i arrived the shop had  other people so not busy i gave them my name and waited when the guy behind the counter came back he said he couldnt find my meat i let him know i paid a deposit and they needed to provide me with the meat he left for about  minutes and came back with a package and said this was it the owner  eli  bagged it and said he was sorry for the confusion that was the last nice thing he said to me ill explain while diving home  now  minutes later  i received a call from eli and he informed me that i picked up the wrong meat and i need to come back  not that they gave me the wrong meat  i asked if the meat i was given was the same and he said no and offered a discount if i did so i went back when i arrived i gave them back the meat and they handed me a package with my name on it i asked what the discount was and eli said  i said  dollar for my time and gas he said yes then he said the other meat you received was the same and you didnt even need to come back i asked why then did they tell me to because the first one was  lb bigger  a pound i asked why i was only getting a  back and the lady that was ringing people up said oh ya  per pound so i asked for what the discount would be off my order nothing the owner then started to patronize me about me wanting a discount for their mistake and my wasted timeelis meats not larrys|try answering your mf phone i called multiple times and the phone rang and rang and then hung up on me i wanted to know if you had a specific toy in stock so i didnt have to drive from summerlin just to find out you didnt anyways i ended up purchasing the toy from amazon they have great customer serviceunlike you guys|worst nail salon ive ever been to they dont deserve even  star as i walked in the salon it was pretty busy so i asked one of the workers about the wait time he was very rude and

never set foot in top nails again|sighs bad poke this is the first  i am sure its an isolated incident have been donating blood for  years and this is the first|horrible experience do yourself a favor and avoid this location or avoid united blood totally i had donated there many times always having the same experience with poor management and a staff with bad attitudes  i recently had seperate appointments dates in where i had shown up for the time i had scheduled and was informed that they were running hours behind schedule  they acted like why would you attempt to donate during this time of the year well the answer is simple you idiots you call me every day on my phone asking me to give blood and when i make an appointment to donate my blood and time you treat me like i should not be therewell you win i will never donate again at any united blood location and i urge you to do the samei went to red cross and was treated like i should beshame on you united blood |no plain bagelshuh how is that possiblethey have one jobmake bagelsthe gourmet bagels were an upsellthey had plenty of thoseexperiences like this remind me what a cow town this really isim annoyed and going to lakes loungewhich is where i should have gone in the first place|please read i only signed up for yelp to review this place because of how horrible the manager was i didnt even get his name because he was so rude  i was so upset he was a morbidly obese man he mustve thought i looked like a poor college student who was looking for a discount when i told him i found a hair on my food he picked it up  left when this man came back he gave me the hair  told me everyone in the kitchen has black hair i couldnt believe he had the nerve a big fuck you would have been better thank you i kept my cool only because i work in the restaurant industry but i will never be back the food wasnt even good i hope this gets back to that nasty manager|when we arrived all the employees were standing around gossiping in a circle and werent helpful about  of them then once we actually talked with an employee they tried to guilt trip us numerous times to take home a puppy we also heard from a former employee that when one of the animals gets sick they just put them down so they do not get the other animals sick they are also insanely expensive when i asked how much one of there pomskys was she said  but she could give them to me for  just like that i dont know what kind of salesperson just drops that amount of money off without a hesitation they work for commission so they will do anything to get rid of the dogs although they have a great selection of different breeds the prices are ridiculous and the employees do not care about the animals just the sale i would not recommend this place to anyone if you love animals and are considering buying one this is not the place to go|saturday  reservations for  people rehearsal dinner made  days earlier and confirmed day of the reservation beyond epic fail sat down at pm while watching management allowing there friends and family members what a joke zero management skills owners should look into management on shift that night what a bunch of jokers doubt we will be back food has always been great and is why we choose this establishment what a shame please correct your management issues with not following protocol shame shame shame|if i could give this minus stars i would  what a rip off  my dh and i are from el paso tx where they have real mexican food   ate here tonight  where to begin  first off we ordered margaritas at  a pop  watered down drool  no flavor and where was the tequila  food was lukewarm  i had cold tacos  my dh had tasteless enchiladas  friends had cold flautas and chile rellenos it all tasted like s tv dinners  and it was expensive   for two tacos and a dollop of canned refried beans and rice  save your money and eat at taco bellits better|to the person who is reading this review i am giving you my take of what happened with the restaurant hostmanager and our reservation i have no idea how the food or the show is as fortunately we left the place to go have a great night at wynn we were looking forward to go to this place and made a reservation on dec nd for their monday show on dec th so basically  days in advance what we got instead was a boot behind the bar where we could only see peoples backs i have to say that was probably the worst seat in the housebeing very disappointed at our seat i went to the front desk and talked to a person who said he is the manager and i thinks his name was roman i told him we made a reservation  days in advance and at  to see the show which was starting at  pm according to their website and his very rude response was there was no note on the reservation and most people make calls oh well sorry for using technology if you dont want people to make reservation on line then mention that on your website or better yet just take your website down so people are only able to call your own website encourages reservation on line as it has a link to open table but there is no mention  about putting a note to indicate a place of seating again if that is what you are expecting then put a map seating chart of your restaurant and ask people to choose their preferred seating dont just surprise your guests on the spot with made up rules just because they are not locals the fact that bourdain visited your restaurant or the owner was the lieutenant governor of nevada does not mean you can be unfair to your customers was it because you realized we are not locals that you decided to treat us unfairly and regardless of the fact that we made our reservation  days in advance for a monday night you sat us behind the bar where we could only see peoples backs i could have a delicious meal and watch beautiful people at the  star hotel i was staying if that was what i wanted to do at  on a monday night it seems to me that they have no idea how to treat guests or yet more plausible they just dont care specially when it comes to out of towners so my fellow reader just be aware if you are not part of their club or the manager does not like your face you have to leave notes when you make reservations but i am afraid that might not be adequate either|horrible spent  dollars on a washer and dryer and paid for a delivery and installation the lady debbie who helped us was nice and told us that our delivery date was dec rd and gave us a  hour window between  she told us that they would call and confirm that we would be there the night before no phone call and wouldnt you know its  and no one has showed called back to home depot and sure enough debbie is there and decides she doesnt care that they arent there and she tells me that it isnt her fault and that she never told us a time frame horrible customer service i will never buy any product from home depot again lowes is my new spot|this place is usually great but the bartender heather is the rudest bartender i have ever seen i cut my finger pretty bad and asked for a bandage and she says no i ask for tape so i could tape a napkin on my finger she tells me no again i asked a question about a sandwich and she says i need to ask the server not herthen the server carol came over and was amazing not only did she answer all of our questions she got me a brandade carol gets  starsheather gets she was absolutely no he rudest person i have ever dealt with as the face of the bar heather where is your christmas spirt thanks for your help carol you need a raiseheather needs anger management and a customer service class|horrible service i tried to make an appointment over the phone and the lady who answered was extremely rude i was trying to figure out which time would work out best for me and she said to call her back when i wasnt wasting her time and then hung up on me not only that but during our phone call i would ask her questions and she would treat me like i was an idiot and answer sarcastically maybe if they had a change of staff they would have more customers|been here since  with  people ahead of me and were all still waiting for service theyre  tellers here  is actually helping a customer out and the rest is sitting and walking around i kinda regret applying and dealing with this bank if it wasnt for my work requiring me to sign up with this bank in order to receive direct deposit i wouldve never wasted my time to sign up here|i cant understand why this is listed high on searches waiters have attitude definitely pricey but food is very average and even disappointing very bland and no flavors or spices of mexican food they do not carry rice beans or chips overall disappointing visit because  our hopes were high btw nothing for vegetarians and staff seem to be very proud of it|bad service it took  hour for our food to arrive and we just ordered for  good thing we bought food from auntie annes that we can eat while waiting |i checked into the hotel this evening and found out wheni got into the room that there is no water in the hotel i was not told at checkin that there was an issue the manager didnt offer a different room or any other solution and barely apologized for the inconvenience i was told that they would bring a couple bottles of water and i am still waiting three hours later this is very unsanitary unfortunately i have no other place to stay tonight|okay so i know we tried to mix the family vacation with the kids in las vegas and to be honest it was for the most part amazing with heaps of activities for the holidays and the kids to enjoy what i found ridiculous was the lack of ability to deal with families traveling with children i have five rooms this stay and checking out tomorrow after a  night stay everyday since we arrived in some way or form we were addressed rudely by staff because we had kids even when just in strollers while trying to buy  tickets to ka at the mlife players club im not upset about the rules at all but the delivery of their message and attitude of majority of the staff we came across during our stay i have stayed at the aria vdara bellagio bluegreen and pallazo and they have all been amazing with us and our kids  and we will return to these places instead of returning here  we ran into three other families traveling with children and i was not surprised at all that they were having the same reaction to staying at the mgm as a gold mlife member i will not be bringing my family here again nor will i be returning on my own  oh and im not even going to go into details on how we couldnt shower for  hours due to a backed up shower tub ok now back to our vacation|i agree w milos reviewseven though im here on compnot worth it w the resort feesrun down elevators and roomsbroken wall socketsdents on doors sagging wall paper etccasinos great though|too old    rooms needs real improvementelevators toooo slow safe not working power failure in bathroom  nights out of     per night hidden resort extra feesnot a repeat |terrible the line to check in was long we were placed in the west wing but directed to the wrong elevators after wandering the hallways we went downstairs and couldnt find anybody to help us we went back up and did not find room numbers my companion went downstairs to wait in line for  minutes to ask where we should go meanwhile i used the phone in the hallway to call the desk i was on hold for ten minutes until a very rude bellman told me that i should go west or learn to read a map it is clear that the staff is dissatisfied and full of disdain for gueststhe next morning i discovered that my double locked bicycle had been stolen off my car in the lit garage the front desk upon check in had resassured me that if the bikes were locked they would be fine because there was  hour security and security cameras the security was rude did not understand why i was upset its just a bicycle mam then after going through the process of filling out paperwork i am told that they do not report the thefts to the police i spent the next few hours at the lvpd every april for the last  years i spend a week in vegas for nab i hope that the luxor makes some attempt to remedy the situation|first the good the staff are friendly and professional the blue man group show is awesome now the rest the bed in our room was old and soft in the middle and the pillows were hard like sand bags there was a strange stain above the headboard that made us think that maybe just maybe an adult movie was filmed there room service is only offered from  am to  pm the ice and vending machines were right outside our room and could be heard all night the rooms in the newer towers are nicer as we visited family who were there but they smelled like smoke my advise is to visit the hotel but stay at another|stayed at luxor for a few nights and let me start with the positives before the negatives the room service maids bell boys all the customer and guest service side was absolutely fantastic if my review was based only on service it would be a  star review now with the negatives we stayed in east tower th floor and let me tell you stay in a tower rather than a pyramid first off the view second not a lot of noise third you are right next to the walk way to the excalibur and strip the hotel needs to be badly remodeled for the amount i had paid if i would pay a bit more i could have went to mgm or paris the room furnishings are falling apart sofas dresser tables drawers bathroom shower and tub i have been staying at the luxor for about  years and its really beginning to age the room side of things brings their scored from a  to a  now lets get started with casino and dinning the casino is one of the best friendly people waitress was very nice and games are fun so no problem there the buffet at the luxor although is something else for the past  years it has been the same crap their selection sucks and the food is nothing but chicken and the desserts are awful  of the time the only good dessert which is the ice cream machine is down with how much each person is paying whether a day pass or one time charge it is definitely not worth what you pay this made our stay not as enjoyable my conclusion is the luxor in my opinion was one of the best the theme the hotel itself is a place to be with the body and titanic museum not to include the casino but the room and food is one of the worst now i dont think i will be coming back which is a surprise as i always choose the lux life although next year might be a time to sleep and dine somewhere that my money will be worth the spending with the strip and a majority of las vegas being more of an attraction to children and tourists the hotel should be a place for adult to sleep and enjoy their stay|late night munchieswings were cold a lil soggy fries good side salad good mozzarella sticks cold eh french dip good but basic customer service gooddiner food gonna give breakfast a try in the morning ok so pancakes this morning were good turkey bacon eh egg whites good again good service still expensive but convenience is a big part of that|terrible buffet not fresh all foods sushi roll taste bad poor quality all the food wasted money i just finished my dinner but im still hungryi made a big mistake that i choose monte carlo buffetill never comeback here|disappointing buffet from the greasy food smell once we entered to the food aspect optionality and food appearance all gave a poor impression on quality waiters are attentive but the food options were mostly breaded and or fried  we ended up leaving after trying some of the non fried dishes we came here while walking towards a show but would not recommend considering so many other options at the strip|if you like to have buffet while youre in las vegas we dont recommend going to bellagio their website says the price would be  but after waiting over half an hour in line they tell us the price is  others waiting in line had also expected to pay  after the meal we will never visit again  because the food and environment are not worth this price|you are lucky if you read my review before u decide to come here its the worst buffet ever we came here because we were told they had an upgrade but its a downgrade theres no king crab leg other food are just same or worse steve wynn wheres the upgrade i would give negative  stars if i could dont ever come here even if its free|had lunch there today waiter was excellentordered a gluten free meal and was glutenedstomach bloated and extreme fatigue has set inguess i cant eat there again| stars i came in knowing that it wasnt the best buffet but  seemed pretty cheap compared to other places on the stripim not a picky eater just look at my previous reviews lol i grew up poor so i know the struggle and i wasnt looking for fine dining at  this place still disappointed me thoughi was excited for the crab legs but couldnt even eat them they were too salty like a previous reviewer said its like they were soaked in salt water on the other hand the mussels were marinated but they were so bland im a seafood lover so this was upsetting for me that their seafood was not up to par eating in thailand a third world country was more delicious not saying that the food in thailand is supposed to be gross or anything but cmon the rest of selection was okay if a bit small the mac and cheese was creamy the spaghetti was very flavorful probably the most flavorful ive had the tortillas were a little hard not the hard shell ones but the ones that were supposed to be soft so it seemed like they were left there for awhile they only had chicken fajitas to fill them with also which disappointed me i love carne asada tacos hahathe desserts were average the ice cream was yummy and they had gelato as well the chocolate mouse and mint mousse in the cups were plain even according to my brother the chocolate ecstasy was very delicious though if youre a chocolate lover overall it wasnt anything special really i would give it  starsthe service like stated by previous reviewers is the reason why i gave the extra star they were attentive and very friendly though there was an elderly woman worker complaining about being tired within earshot i know it was close to closing time but you shouldnt act like that in front of customers this is coming from a past manager in retail presence and attitude is key to a happy experience on the guests behalf that was the only person who wasnt very good with service special thank you to the asian worker who was so funny and nice thoughi dont think ill be coming back sadly|poor food quality poor service food didnt look fresh almost looked like reheated microwave stuff |humiliated disgusted and amazed at the lack of professionalismi have stayed at this hotel many timesi have always enjoyed the atmosphere and hospitality that i have received in the past in the pasthyatt has definitely seen a change in its customer satisfactioni had an unfortunate incident and when i requested to speak with the general manager to resolve the issue of several specific charge disputes i was refused only after my own research was i able to leave a message for the general managers assistant i have yet to receive an explanation for charges an accurate charge or communication from anyone from this restaurant and hyatt hotel the incident was that there was  bottle of wine that was misrepresented to myself and guest who unintentionally ordered a bottle of wine for the amount of  now i can appreciate a good wine but i was not prepared for this purchase nor was i expecting this charge to my surprise when i received the bill for  i requested to speak to the manager i requested from manager to review the menu with me and to discuss an option for payment as i did not have the immediate means to on me at that moment and that i would gladly leave my card and drivers licence with home till morning when i would return with payment he inexcusably humiliated my guest and i in front of other guest staff and each other by making us sit there for an hour and a half before calling the police to have me arrested for theft i over and over again explained that i was able and willing to pay for the wine i just had to wait for bank to open or for credit card to release funds i showed the manager my checking account which had a balance of and that i would gladly pay for the wine that i disputed purchasing in the first place to avoid getting incarcerated by the local police departmentthe police were very kind and compassionate to the situation while they escorted us from the hotelthe next morning i reviewed my credit card charges only to find that the hotel had charged me  times in the amount of not one charge attempt for when i called and emailed the manager with bank statements and requested his review and to give me a explanation for the charges did he respond  noi travel very frequently as well as being a member and employee of aaa i would not recommend this establishment|i went for lunch yesterday with my little brother and was sorely disappointed in the service and food the waitress was slow with refilling our drinks and the food took over half an hour to come out which was odd since there was basically nobody there when it did come out the kobe cheese burger i ordered was extremely rare i ordered medium well and the fries were mediocre my brother had a bacon barbecue burger cooked medium and his burger came out well done when we notified the waitress of the mistakes she offered to bring the plates back to the kitchen but it would be a while before we would get it back rather than sit there any longer waiting we choose to pay and eat elsewhere|this review is mostly about their hyped oxtail soup i am asian and have been spoiled by the amounts of oxtail soup i have eaten in orange county california parking was free for me because the gate operator was gone i did see signs about validation requirements throughout the parkinglot the only plus is that they serve oxtail at afterclubbing hours the downside is that it is served at afterclubbing hours the oxtail is mediocre the broth is too salty and the oxtail itself was a bit dry if you are asian or familiar with oxtail soup then you will be disappointed about the oxtail soup here if there is a line to be seated then it isnt worth it i arrived at  pm on saturday and was lucky to be seated right away if you come after  you will probably have to wait in line i would recommend you to just find a pho vietnamese soup restaurant and order oxtail from there|worst garden experience ever there is little to appreciate plus the construction site nearby is not helpingstopped by when traveling to pheonix would never come back really disappointed me|not a place to bring a child they charged full price for a baby that was years old the cashiers was not friendly and couldnt hardly understand english my sister ask why are we paying full price and maybe not a discount price like any other businesses she told us that even if it was an arm baby coming in to their establishment they would be charged the full price i dont agree that is why i am posting this comment in order for parents who have several babies is not subject to such a ridiculous practice as far as me and my baby and our family will not be eating at the feast till she is able to grab freakin plate her self golden corral here we come|the worst dim sum  horrible service ever food was bland place is dirty dont bother coming if u dont speak chinese all the carts purposely skipped our table we waited forever  always got the last picks when it was cold  not fresh everything sucked|hello danieli appreciate your response to my indepth review i am amending my review from  star to  stars because it is the holiday season and i feel bad being your very first  star reviewhowever i want you to know that i counted all of the flavors in your two cases and you did not have  flavors at  pm on december st  you had exactly  flavors available  perhaps you need to ask your employee why there were only  flavorstell me why is frost able to make their delicious waffle cones twice a day without large gaping holes in the bottom of their cone and are also able to add a sanitary paper wrapper maybe you need to ask them how they do it  ive eaten gelato in rome paris and tokyo to name a few  and ive never seen a large hole in the bottom of any cone before you have a problem with quality control and yet you dont even seem to careas for the gummy worm found in my mud pie chocolate gelato why dont you rename it theres a worm in my pie as that seems more fitting lol|drove  minutes to get one of the vegan pasties   sat down ordered a beverage and asked what the vegan daily specials are  server told me they arent making any vegan pasties today and suggested i just get a vegetarian pasty instead  really  not the same thing   if youre going to put vegan options on the menu dont just decide not to  either make them or take them off the menu   major waste of my time|this was not a bad place considering its nice service i ordered the grilled salmon and it was nice and tender the sauce was a little oily however on the other hand my friends were not so lucky one ordered the chicken and couldnt tell any difference between that dish and the grilled chicken sold in the college cafeteria the other had the short rib and it was overcooked the most miserable guy had the onion soup which was too salty and the claim pasta in which the pasta was raw they were disappointed with the dinner that day and the price was kind of high especially regarding their dishes not recommended if you want to find a good place with budget but the location the service and some of the dishes were fine|had the worst lunch ever and will never be back  pork dish was nothing but fat and rice tasted two days old|food was delicious but i cant say much for the service weve sat unattended to for over mins the restaurant was not busy when my gf and i went we ended up going to the server for to go boxes and for the check|this was a little kiosk behind the escalator  it doesnt offer any seating which seemed odd to me  we got green tea but i think they gave us earl gray  we also purchased a buchon which is a brownie bitegood service reasonable prices for vegas but no need to go back|disappointed poor customer service decided to take our  and  yr old for a quick ride on the go carts there were no lines when we arrived and were quickly informed by the teenager working the ticket counter that the go carts were closed due to the rain we were a bit taken back as it was not raining and the tracks both appeared to be dry they could not tell us when they would be availableoh well we settled for minature golf which was available and the kids had fun but the course seemed really aged and worn we finished our round in about  minutes and as we were heading out saw others lining up for the go carts i mentioned to the teen at the counter that we were not allowed to buy tickets  mins earlier and they didnt offer any expalantion or apology just said theyre open now since we were there at lunch time we assumed their staff was on break and did not want to run the carts when we first arrived rain seemed like a poor excuse since the tracks were dry and they began running the carts shortly after a bit disappointed with the customer service and if they could have been more open with their cart closure at least provide a time estimate to when they might reopen after dropping  on mini golf for an adult and two kids and the poor experience with the ticket counter did not want to spend any more time or money there|this is super close to home so decided to check it out tonight i dont see us coming back spent  and left most of our food on the table because it was so awful the server never asked how the food was or offered a substitute when dish after dish was untouched after a bite or  when asked for something else was told that was not an option the only item comped were the shrimp shumai because they were still frozen in the center will stick to travelling a few miles rather than a quarter mile for a dinner that consisted of stringy and improperly prepared sashimi maguro the masago was an odd pale orange color with little flavor the sweet and spicy roll was more cream cheese than anything spicy or appetizing the cream crab korokkeresembled a deep fried phlegm ball no flavor and i imagine had comparable texture even the california rolls were underwhelming the only thing we enjoyed were the gyoza though we had to request a sauce to accompany the dish they were cold by the time the server returned with about a tablespoon of brown liquid in a bowl|this theatre is run by amateurs  i knew something was wrong when the theatre was not showing the usual amc promos but was assured that this was because it was the first show of the day  finally right when the movie was scheduled to start the alleged manager came in reporting the file was corrupted and it would take two hours to download  i guess checking a movie before it is run is outside the thinking capacity of this crowd  never again|i got married on december th at planet hollywood and in my package i got i got my hair and makeup in it on my wedding day i was so excited and i loved how she did my hair but my makeup was not anything how i wanted after my appointment i took off my makeup and lucky mac took me in and made me feel like a bride should on there special day to add her name is prissy she used her own personal makeup and had dirty brushes i wouldnt even add a star here but they make you very unsatisfied|literally the worst company i have ever dealt with in my entire life no exaggeration i have never dealt with especially so consistently rude heartless unintelligent people i think because they know customers dont have an option they think it is okay just so frustrating when nothing can be done to alleviate myself from ever having to deal with them i work in customer service i am quite sensitive to not taking my company concerns out on the representative but in most my scenarios the rep was actually the one who caused the aggravation in the first place|this is my first visit to this fedex store and my last  i walked in and was th in line  patti was helping another man pack a large box for christmas  we all waited for over  minutes for this one customer and patti was the only employee on   while i was waiting another customer walks in with a problem  patti eventually helped this customer before offering to help me  when this customer pointed out to patti that i was next patti told her that it doesnt matter and continued to help the customer behind me  at this point karen had come in and was helping customers  and i was still waitingover  minutes at this point  when the other customers were finished patti skipped over me to the next person in line  i spoke up at this point and told patti that i needed my package boxed  she told me after over  minutes of waiting that she could not package my item because there were too many other customers in line  this is after she spent quite a bit of time packaging an item for the customer before mei left and went to another shipping store in the same plaza where i got much better service  i tried to leave a review on the fedex site for this store and cannot find the write a review link  on the fedex site for this store there are no reviews that are less than  stars  funny how on yelp you get a completely different picturepatti was rude to me and one other customer and i for one will not ever enter that store again|ordered a large pizza  wings and a antipasta salad to go got home looked at the salad welted lettuce like literally brown see photo the wings were tiny little over cooked bones not enough sauce in the world could make them edible and the pizza was just meh anyways we drove back to rays to swap out the wilted salad for something a little more green and get wings with meat on them when we talked to the manager and the owner they were not apologetic for the repulsive food but instead chose to argue and insist that the food was fine really if the food was fine do you think we would have driven all the way back to swap them out wow|so mad how rude can an establishment be when they serve rotten lettuce and burnt dry wings with a soso pepperoni pizza  bucks wasted  after we took the food back to just ask for a quick replacement we were greeted with distain and disbelief even though the owner was staring at wilted yellow slimy lettuce and burnt dry wings with zero sauce i ordered extra sauce by the way we go here because its close to the house every time something is wrong but we dont complain and just eat but drew the line with the wretched salad and wings this trip and will  have to drive farther to eat good food next time lorenzos on scottsdale rd and pinnacle peak delish sorry but this rays pizza is horrendous and i will never spend another dollar here nor will friends and family|the workers must be trained to give you one pickle half a cucumber and a sprinkle of lettuce because we had to ask for more of each topping dont understand why the service has to be so chincy do not recommend this subway franchisesuch a waste of time and money|my experiences with dr donald cunningham and his staff were extremely disappointing to say the least  i was treated very condescending and rude as well as dismissive from dr donald cunningham and his hispanic female medical assistant as it stemmed from a recent visit of which i was  minutes late due to scottsdale traffic and the accusation was brought up that i was noncompliant as a patient when that is further from the truth  so i didnt appreciate being judged from them as a patient and a military veteran  so i have to add that theyre not veteran friendly and that from my observation they also displayed behavior that indicates that they protect there staff when there staff provides poor service to make the patient appear out of touch with their own complaints  dr leroy kareus was my initial doctor but sadly he passed away  in my own opinion he was the gentle soul of that practice  i will now locate a new family medical practice that appreciates their patients and americas veterans|i went with the family on a friday night   the wait was about  to  minutes   the service was good  we got wings and mozzarella sticks as starters  the wings were great  the mozzarella sticks are a little different theyre wrap in wong tong wraps  vs the traditional breading  i dont think ill order those again the family didnt like them we ordered chessebuger and onion rings and the kids ordered pizza and a salad   it felt like forever for the food to arrive and when it did it was vold theres nothing worse than cold food  the waitress told it back and when it was returned the hamburger was over cooked and the cheese was completely  melted off  the onion rings were burnt from being cooked again  will i go back    maybe for the drinks but not for the food|not very organized or very english speaking but the last point is expected so this place basically only serves tamales and at  per dozen it was the cheapest in the valley i called in an order and three days later when i arrive my order my name and anything else got lost in translation and there was no order what a waste but luckily since all they make is tamales you can just pick them up off the steam table and head off    corn  very yellow with real corn inside but blandgreen chile  this a hot version so beware with a carrot and onion inside also too spicypork  i dont like so did not trybeefchicken  they were outthe point of calling ahead is get what i wanted so they failed miserably in that respect and they also could use some better english speaking skills this place will close if trump gets elected sometimes the cheapest stuff is the place to avoid|extremely undercooked steak the last  times we were here  like frozen center raw plus they keep getting more stingy other locations i dont have to order double here i do just to similar amount|told me to go to walgreens when they didnt have my prescription staff was much too lazy to order it or refer me to another cvs  every other cvs in town has had my prescription|service is lacking during the day seems like they are short staffed  also the waitress is inattentive with an attitide have to get up and go order my food bc she never checks on us|i chose this facility because of the yelp reviews i am from out of town and my yr old son who has asd needed to see a dr for his cough runny nose and fever hes had his cough for over a month now and within the last  days his nose started to run this is not my st child i have a yr old and a yr old as well i know that its only a matter of time once their noses start to run that there is going to be a sinus infection and so i waited and sure enough here comes the fever and the deep dark green mucus i dont think the dr that we saw even read the part of his chart that mentioned he was autistic because he came in and was asking him questions like he was a normal child so he proceeds to exam my son by tapping on his sinus points what the heck was that not once did he look up inside his nose not once he based his diagnoses that there was nothing wrong off of tapping his sinuses all of my kids have really bad sinuses that is why i dont even bother taking them to the dr until i know when its necessary then the dr listens to his chest and says something about hearing a little restricted air flow in one of his lungs and sends over to another facility where i now have to pay more money out of pocket to see if he might have pneumonia what so off we go to sit in a waiting room for over an hour which my autistic son was not happy with about at all then the dr calls me to tell me results which were a big fat negative i could have told you that because i already now he has a sinus infection so the dr tells me to go get overthecounter antihistamine medicine to treat his symptoms what the heck do you think i have been doing thus whole time saline spray antihistamine humidifier and benadryl at night time so he can sleep now its  in the morning and he can not stop coughing thanks for nothing and not to mention now its  days away from christmas and we are not due to go home for another  days and my son is going to get worse i come to henderson nv quit often because we have family that lives here i thought i was happy to have found a facility in the area that my insurance would cover and after doing research on it i also thought my son would be in good hands boy was i wrong i paid money out of pocket for basically keep doing what you are doing looks like hes going to be miserable till we can go home and see his ent who will diagnose him with a sinus infection and give him antibiotics which he hasnt been on for over a year and a half which will actually work for him because i dont feed my child garbage food if in the future i should need a pediatrician for my children while visiting my family it definitely wont be anyone from this office|tried their chicken chipotle burrito and i remember rice taste only which was not soft  even looked undercooked|this the least expensive fuel in northwest las vegas  clean facility with good service in store|very disappointing and unsatisfied was only at my house for  minutes left and never called back i called to ask for the estimate a guy answered and said oh let me have someone call you now on day  i finally got a call for the price  for a crack in my double pane glass i asked if they can replace the pane as other companys said they can do it without a problem for  with home depot  the response i got back was ya we can but its just too much work i would rather just replace the whole window because we have to take it apart and its a mess i would never use this company over priced and bad customer service|the people inside the facility were pleasant and cordial  however if you will have to deal with their finance departmentthink it well before you patronize them  their finance department is rude forceful and will try to get you to pay more than you should for their services  they will try to strongarm and intimidate you into excessive payment if you let them  buyer beware|i just bought a condo two days ago  they refused to give me my parking space number because they say im not in the system yet  they want me to come in the office showing a recorded deed just to receive my parking space number  very rude over the phone really people|i want laser hair removal   i called to make an appointment but the girl couldnt even give me a range for pricing  i asked if i should expect to pay  or  and she told me id have to meet with the consultants  theyve been advertising  off on the radio    of  is still outside the price im willing to pay especially after these horrible reviews    im sorry but i cant walk into a place with the expectation that im going to get scammed|this buffet is the worst they were closed for  months for remodeling the room is nice but the food is horrible trays are always empty and food is cold been there  times and had to point out the empty trays to the workers each time i wont be back and would not recommend this place to anyone the old buffet was much better|i got food poisoning last month i called multiple times but since they do not answer the phone and their website email does not work this was unfortunately my only recourse my intention was to advise them of the problem so they could investigate the cause and work with their staff on keeping a clean environment to avoid cross contamination i was so sick i honestly thought i was going to die thank god for activated charcoal this saved me from s trip to the emergency room i loved sushi but this place has me really turns off i will definitely not go back im sorry for venting on yelp but when they do not answer their phone number google number or have a valid email this is the option|this location is just terrible if you ever need a training on how not to do customer service please stop by this location this is the second time i called in hours in advance to make sure i could take my car in and was told that i would not be seen until the next day when i first walked in there was a guy coming out cursing and yelling and thought ok maybe hes having a bad day then there was a women in the store who waited for  hours and the store put the wrong tires on her vehicle which were low quality store rep jeremy advised her to come back tomorrow and they will change the tires to the correct ones not once offering an apology or any type of compensation for the hassle or her time wasted i have been a customer for years and sad to say i will not be returning to this store anymore|i made my reservation  days in advance got two confirmations   hours before i was to pick up my truck i get this call from a tyree speaking very fast telling me that my truck will not be available but he has one  miles away  i was confused asking why and he said without any apology thats all we have you can take it or i can cancel your reservation i called customer service and after emily would not even try to help me find other locations easier for me to get to i asked for a supervisor  she said no and refused  then she finally said she would transfer me and hung up  this happened twice  thank goodness i could redial the number of the dispatch that called i  got to at least talk about an option but there was none   so a reservation  and confirmations with this company mean nothing  oh and they would not give me extra time to account for the extra time to get the truck  i would give them  stars if i could|the burgers here are the worst in las vegas the meat was dead  there were no fillings on the burgers we sent the meal back paid a tip and left barmaid was good to take one meal off the bill but her service was non caring she took a long time to do anything in the end  very poor experiencetoo many places in vegas rely on tourist not coming back eg no repeat business concerns so sub standard meals and sub standard service  tip still expected|i was there a while ago  minutes wait for the pizza and asked for chicago cut  they didnt know what the was i explain the was a square cuts they did not get it it was a kid about  to  years old explain to them how to do it go figures because we wait  minutes the pizza was hot|before this review is set into place i just want to say that i have previously loved hot n juicy so much that i rave about it to others yet im sitting here tonight to complain about their horrible customer service when i came here my name was written down and i was told that it would be half an hour wait even after the half an hour mark i insisted to my bf that sometimes servers are wrong on their wait time i gave them the benefit of the doubt the server started to seat people based on the amount of people in the party rather than giving priority to who came first you might ask how the heck i would know this and the answer to this question is that a party of  who very obviously put their name down after mine were seated first once we were seated  minutes later we waited another  for a server to even ask us what we would like dear hot n juicy executives we all get busy i get that but some employees of yours need to be disciplined on the meaning of customer service i might have not brought a large party but that doesnt mean i didnt bring a big appetite i hope the next time i come in this indecency will not be an issue|worst customer servicerefused to seat a part of two at an open table plus they told us to go to the other location if we wanted to get seated faster  so im supposed to drive  minutes out of my way to the other location  believe me your food isnt that good|i unfortunately have to update my review to one star i came in today with a coworker for lunch nothing was wrong with the food but there was an incident one of the waiters spilled broth all down my back the waiter knew what he did and said ohbut didnt bother to say a word to me i only noticed what he had done after i felt the broth soaking into my clothes i grabbed napkins and started to clean off my clothes and nothing was still said to me it was only when i went to ask for my check a guy by the name of andy simply said sorry about that i asked what i was supposed to do if my clothes ended up with oil stains he said it was only broth its not going to stain its not like it was red wine or anythingand it was really only a few drops so i told him no there is oilso it can stain and no it wasnt a few drops my entire back is wet again his responseoh well sorryim beyond furious and it blows my mind that if i hadnt said anything they wouldnt have even caredrest assured they will be getting the dry cleaning bill if these spots dont come out|cheap food from a box  nothing fresh or from scratch  racist trash frequent the bar  watching fox news while spewing political ignorance  social intolerance and racial epithets|i ordered my birthday cake from here and made the mistake of paying in full before i went to pick it up the cake was done wrong and they charged me extra for fondant lettering which they decided not to put on my cake on top of that the cake did not taste good at all very disappointed obviously they dont give refunds if you pay in full and are not satisfied so its a loss for me fortunately my husband surprised with a beautiful and delicious cake from freeds bakery which is where we will be purchasing cakes from now on go someplace where you will get what you ordered this is not the place|we always endeavor to support mom and pop operations so when my son and i wanted a nosh on a sunny december morning we popped by this place at first i wondered if it was open as there appeared to be few cars out front but walking in the door realized there were a few people having spent a fair amount of time in europe were accustomed to bistros and were delighted with menu selections we placed our order which was simply a butter croissant cappuccino slice make that sliver quiche lorraine and a small cake twenty bucks plus tip wasnt cheap but hey its a mom and pop were supporting long story short i waited  minutes for my cappuccino before i went to the counter to ask about it a terse were short staffed was all i got as i glanced to my right to see the three staffers checking their phones i sat down and a few minutes later a cold and i mean cold cup sans saucer sugar spoon or even a smiling waitress was sloshed in front of me l promptly returned it with my own terse remark its cold the reply wasnt met with an equally warm response and i got my warmernever hotsupposed to be cappuccino no line of demarcation of bold espresso and a foamy top nope this slop resembled latte at best and overcreamed coffee at worst awful for all  of it it appeared one of two things either my son and i in our casual wear were not the sort welcomed in this snooty wannabe cafe or patrons are simply nuisances either way we shall not return while the butter croissant was delightful it was not compelling enough to return especially when another fabulous french bakery exists just down the road oh and a remark to the owners if you fashion yourselves as a posher alternative to coffee bean grab a little window cleaner and tidy up those filthy entry doors|had been going to the store since  i normally ask if they could slice meat for sukiyaki which i know takes a while so i normally give them a  hour window and i place the order ahead of time today they refused and said they were too busy  i tried to explain that i could wait and pick up the order the next day but i was given a series of pathetic of excusesthe new manager is rude and when i asked to speak to the owner apparently hes the new owner too im never going back  they just lost some business and a loyal customer|the forgotten tablethe service ruined the experience to start off we were upsold by the server on the portion size of the appetizer it didnt bother me the fact he didnt listen to our request but it did bother me once we pointed it out neither the server or manager fix the mistake our food came out in the wrong order which i would of let go if it wasnt cold the server never returned to offer us a new cocktail and that wouldnt of been as much if we had recieved water after our fourth request we were compensated a comp on the food we didnt eat or order and offered  a  gift card in return there was no favor done here we paid for a discounted messed up appetizer a round of drinks and a salad and wasted our evening in return|definitely not what ive experienced at other mccormick and schmicks or ms grille nothing justified the price not service not surroundings and definitely not the food the menu was very limited the preparation was off and the service was lacksidaisical|we decided to take my mom and dad out for a nice evening in scottsdale where they snowbird my mom has recently gotten into wine so we chose this place and we ended up regretting it we had poor service terrible wine and an issue with the check that was never resolved this place appears to be completely mismanaged and we wont be going back live and learn|nothing was made right here with our order not even margarita we just moved in this neighborhood and looking for a local bar to hang out but this bar is not the place to be|we got there at  and they didnt want to cook anything because they were almost closed obnoxious i ordered smoothie and they didnt have enough people  event though there were five people there they didnt want to wash their machine again rude dont go here|this place was fine when i came last yearbut this yearnopethe attitude of the waiters were rude and the unfair pricing of the tipsthey charge  for everyone even kids under  nothing good to eat the only thing that i liked was pastasnothing else|a really bad buffet for the value went in on a tuesday night in december   their heating elements to keep things warm on the buffet table dont seem to work as well as any other buffet everything was lukewarm they charge  for a dinner buffet they dont even have crab legs or shrimp cocktail   also they dont even have the roast beefprime rib carving station all the meats are precut sitting there waiting to get cold  there is a lack of variety and a lack of options compared to other las vegas buffets  its just not a good deal  even most  budget dinner buffets have better food and a greater variety compared to themdesserts are the only saving grace of this place  they have dryers scoop ice cream  scoop ice cream is hard to find in most buffets  outside of their desserts this is a onestar buffet that is not worth the  price  save  go to a budget dinner buffet like the gold coast hotel or circus circus and youll have a much better experience|horrible staff front desk ladies force you to take a picture even if you dont want one old usher dude has an ego larger than these casinos i get it old dude youre  and suck at everything in life taking people to their chairs is the only thing youre qualified to do still though no reason to shake my hand and drag me back to your usher podium just because you werent there when i walked in and thought it was a self serve deal hope the show is better than the staff|went for brunch and ordered a burrito with red sauce and rice the rice was hard and tasteless and the burrito was bland my son who is  ordered a breakfast burrito and the lady taking our order asked if he wanted one or two he replied with two when we picked up our food the breakfast burritos were each the size of his head with a serving of chips and refried beans when i asked about why she would offer something like that to a family of two i was told it was already made and no refunds never expected to get scamed at a hotel resturant|trust me ok we thought we were going to see beautiful christmas lights and amazing glass  that is not what you get  the lights are just white on trees and stupid bags with candles  the glass is few but can be cool  i did love all the music very talented  but for the  this is a total bust  dont do it unless your on a date and happy to just drink wine and listen to music|made an appointment during the phone call the man i was speaking to was very rude came there right on time waited  minutes before i decided to leave not sure why i even made an appointment if they were going to completely ignore it|went inside to order  chicken tacos on taco night big mistake  people before me and  people after me got their orders and the entire drive thru line was cleared up when i asked about my order they still managed to get it wrong their only saving grace is they are lucky im so cheap i guess you get way you pay for|i love starbucks but this location is the reason why i go to dutch bros everyone who works here especially the girls are extremely rude i waited  minutes for a green tea|i just had a really bad experience over there actually the sales are good and then i bought two watches this august and then they invited me to attend the event on  and told me i could invite my friends also i have checked so many times with them and they told me they could give me four tickets just right now the manager told me only two tickets they can give to me so where are other tickets going and where is your promise i have talked to him about i do not have a plan b and i have already booked the hotel then the manager said i could cancel it are you  really kidding me  this is disgusting|seriously  we were last there about  years ago when we had a fantastic experience  went last night and our first clue should have been that it was pretty empty even given that it was pm  the caesar for  was ridiculously overpriced  per person minimum  people  they made it rather screwed it up table side  so much so much oil it gave me immediate heartburn  the chicken dish was overcooked by about x it was like rubber or rather a hockey puck  when i headed to the restroom they intercepted me and told me that the restrooms were not working so i had to use the one in the lobby  waitress was a little overly friendly and familiar not professional quality  my question is when are they closing this place  it turned into a dump so disappointed with our experience  even smelled musty  could not wait to leave|dont bother came here at  for  opening the restaurant was completely empty and they turned us away because the whole place was reserved with reservations for the entire night there was no mention online or if you called only a sign on the desk when you come in and we drove  mins to get there it was also a wednesday not a weekend terrible business model and they were even rude when they turned us away no apologies no explanation just no walk ins next just go somewhere else|i love einstein bagels but this location really struggles if you show up at am they are usually out of most bagels i have to wonder if this store would double its sales if they could keep up with the demand i dont know where the problem is maybe poor planning small oven no bagel storage i have no idea but it needs fixing there are some nice people that work there but they alls looked stressed i hope they can find a way to improve the operation here as my patience is wearing with this location|the only reason that this chilis gets more than one star is because the server was courteous and helpful had it not been for her this location would be all but useless my party arrived at about pm after standing unattended for about five minutes a host came and addressed us they set up a table for my party  adults  preschooler  newborn and we were seated eventually a server came and took our drink orders the drinks took about  minutes to arrive once the drinks arrived we ordered so at this point it was about  we finally received our food at around pm one member of our party ordered a steak with shrimp broccoli and mashed potatoes the plate was warm but the meal was room temperature at best another member ordered pasta and received cold pasta and bread that was hard as a hockey puck i had ordered mini cheeseburgers for my daughter the preschooler and they arrived with no cheese finally i had ordered the loaded baked potato soup and they informed me that the soup was frozen and they could not make me that soup thats fine but they didnt tell me this until five minutes before everyone elses food came out i have never had such a horrid experience at a restaurant i dont intend to return to that location the entire detestable experience didnt conclude until close to pm after we finally got togo boxes for our coldserved food hopefully a microwave will resurrect the abominations that were delivered but sadly it will not return to me the time i wasted this evening|went by tonight because i was craving a burgerarrived at pmmind you they are still supposed to be open at this very moment according to the time as the door clearly stated pm  i even checked online to see what time they closed to be sure and the red open sign was still on which is why i went inside however when i walked in there was a gentleman at the grill wiping it lights were dimmed and chairs put up i asked if they are already closed and he replied almosti then asked if i could order something since it was only  after  and they are not due to close till pm instead of responding he turns and goes to the backso i waited mainly just to see if he was going to come back or wait hoping i would leave he then comes back out about  minutes later and i ask the same questionthen i ask to speak to a manager he points to the a wall and says you can call  i said what is the managers and is there a number or cardhe replies noi again ask for the managers name and he replied eduardo  i said i saw another employee in the back when i walked in can i speak to him the nd employee comes out and tells me he was cleaning the bathrooms and he was the acting manager  he nonchalantly apologized for the other reps behavior and asked if he could help mesir you have turned off the lights picked up all the chairs turned off all the grills and have bathroom handswhat exactly is it that you think you can do for me at this point  i am in complete shock at the lack of anything that this place of business had to offer me which was nothing  i then ask him for the managers name and info he says i am the manager i then said the other gentleman just said it was eduardo he then said eduardo is the gm i am acting manager  i said can i please have the gms info please he again stated in his nonchalant manner he will be in tomorrow  i know its the holiday season and everyone is trying to get home to their families but if your sign says open and your doors are not locked and i walk in dont ignore me just hoping i will go away that is just horrible never again fatburger|first off the food is decent this is not what the review is about it actually goes to the heart of the service went with my wife and two small children for the first time before we even received a greeting the blowhard behind the counter was yelling at my kids to not touch his precious glass case because in his words he has to clean it  times per day boo hoo kids touch stuff then we tried to order he yelled again because my kids went to find us a table and they had the audacity to play with the little number stand on the table and yes he yelled at them a third time for touching the little glass vase set on the table get the feeling we were being watched this was before we even placed an order should have left at this point but we decided to order once we were out of blowhards crosshairs we had to watch him berate his employees couldnt get out of there fast enough should post a pic of myself cause thats the only way they will ever see me again|we made the mistake of going to the in store restaurant that was absolutely the worst dining experience i have ever had first off our kids were playing while we waited for our table to be readied my daughter slipped on your floor right into a gift card stand she has a giant goose egg and bruise on her forehead from that then after being seated it took nearly  min to get our drinks i guess our server mariah according to our receipt had dropped her first tray of drinks still not sure how it took so long even with dropping a tray we didnt get any straws and had to go hunt them down ourselves then she took her notepad out to take our order a bus person told her another table needed her so instead of taking our order she went and spent  minutes closing that table out then she took our order it took a long time for our food to come out we could see two of the plates sitting on the counter warmer for quite some time after delivering the food our server disappeared into the kitchen my order wasnt correct so i tracked down the manager he acted like i was inconveniencing him while he was chatting and drinking at the bar with his friend after getting my fries which were clearly old and nasty by the way i finally got to sit and eat my dry overcooked mahi mahi over a bed of semi crunchy undercooked rice we gave up waiting for boxes and found our own our server didnt check on us until we asked for the bill then came the wait for the bill we packed up the kids and headed for the front in hopes of speeding things along we left no tip for our server this is the first time i have ever not left a tip it was also the worst experience id ever had i asked for corporate contact info instead she gave us her managers card with his email remember the one drinking and chatting instead of managing this fiasco as my family and our friends headed for the exit our server had the audacity to yell across the restaurant tips are how we make a living you know maybe she doesnt realize that tips are earned and to tell that at customers as they leave with their children now you may be wonder how busy the restaurant was while we were there we were one of four tables there were two servers so to answer your question not that busy attached is a photo of my daughters goose egg from slipping she is two and says it hurts this experience today was absolutely horrible|we have eaten here several times and the food has always been very good but tonight we left before our food arrived  we couldnt believe that a family owned business would have treated us the way were were treated by our waitress  no christmas spirit existed for us tonight in this place  our waitress was one of the rudest waitresses my family has experienced in a long time  my daughters were in amazement  our menues were practically thrown on our table  we asked about some menu options and she acted perturbed that we were even asking and never answered us she didnt say hi to us once just wanted to know what we wanted to drink and eat i was the first to order and her response was did we want anything else there were four of us  i guess she thought we were all going to share a meal this lady never once cracked a smile  she threw our plates on the table stacked  they were dirty and we set them on the empty table next to us and she brought them back to us and when we pointed out that a couple were dirty she gave us a dirty look and snatched them up and walked off  we were done and decided to walk out  we will never go back to this place  zero stars for customer service|the hubs and i went there on a friday evening for dinner and this place is truly unremarkable the menu was just okay food was okay and drinks were just okaythe only thing remarkable about the place was the value or lack of value for the price that was paid service was okay i thought that it should have been better since we were one of  couples in the place not so i wont drive to bfe for that restaurant ever again|update  weeks laterour lease was through nov th and we still had a few small things in our apartment on the th i went on the th in the morning to pickup our vacuum and some boxes when i arrived there were people in our apartment painting also painting the patio which they told us a year ago they would do and cleaning some stuff up they had thrown away our vacuum that means that they went into our place of living which we legally occupied until midnight that night without asking and took our belongings i went to the front desk to inquire about who was going to retrieve our vacuum management told me that maintenance would get it out  when i brought up the fact that the lease was not over until the end of the day she said we never heard from you with a smirk someone called me asking me about a final walk through and yes i never called back how that has anything to do with them breaking and entering into my rightfully rented space i am not sure no one ever called and said they would be painting or entering or ending my contract early i could and should press charges and they are probably counting on my not pressing charges because i am a nice guyso i took my vacuum and left i then received a bill in the mail a week later for items that they replaced non of which where new or even in good condition when we moved in i took pictures the day we moved in of everything to prove the condition it was not my first time rentingi have spoken with families that live there that are now moving after i told them about the mess and they have their own issues with management i will never let another person i know rent from these people again|was put on hold for over an hour called back a few times and the same person answered she would not direct me to anyone but was left on hold with no answer again no customer service whatsoever|service

use their copy centre for business needs if you require a receipt most of the machines were jammed or not warmed up the machine i used stopped working after printing about  copies and then wouldnt give me my receipt needed in order to be reimbursed the manager couldnt get it to print either and told me they cant retrieve it from their systems for several hours but would email me my receipt its been well over a week and i never got an email and therefore had to pay for my works copiessadly the copy centre used to be better staffed and has obviously been gutted beyond use|i would give this place more stars if they had adequate staffing its pretty common to come in here and see what i see  people waiting to order drinks or buy bottles at the bar and  people who work here running around bussing tables or serving food while the people wanting a drink at the bar have that look in their eyes|i want to come in recite my order once pay and get out however the design of the queue is infuriating for a quick experience especially when ordering for a family of  want a  sandwich and soup meal for dad mac n cheese for the kiddos and a salad and soup meal for mom  well give your sandwich order at the first counter for dad the salad order for mom at the salad counter the soup orders for both mom and dad at the soup and pasta counter and then be told that the mac and cheese order a pasta dish if i am correct should have been ordered at the sandwich counter not the soup and pasta counter there is no guidance on what is ordered where and frankly when ordering for  i cant keep track of which component is ordered at whatever respective counter and maintain my sanity at the same time and what is this business of not including a cookie with the soup and salad meal  apparently you only get a cookie with a sandwich order or kids meal they cost the same so what gives  if nothing else make it clear for me to know that i need to order a cookie for a salad meal its disappointing to get home and realize it isnt included in short the process is far from intuitive the queue is not designed for a family meal   i will not return for an easy take home meal for my family at the end of a busy day|there are  people at the bar spending money and its pmlast call was called  i took the last sip out of my beer and put the empty glass in the rail the bartender never came back to ask if i wanted another beer he called last call and didnt give the option of having another beer it was last call and heres your tab not to mention as a previous bar owner and bartender for  years he started counting tips while everyone was still at the bar customer service is crap at best from the bartender i came in with  other people and we havent been here  hours and we are getting routed out youve got paying customers keep the joint open just saying thanks jared and have a merry christmas|i wish there was less than  start to give to this place  very rude management that pretty much summarizes the experience you should expect there|the blush is off this rose  pity   the place once an icon of kitch is now a tiki ashtray   clearly so rundown that they have you sitting in the dark literally  so you cant see how much a pit its become  youve got to run your smart phone flashlight to see the menu   all of our clothes needed tossed into the laundry too get the stench out and my hair washed twice gag  they are now milking the past history to draw you in tourist trap  avoid|been going here for years getting the exact same style of acrylics for  dollars for a new set one day went in and they told me it was  but they will do  for me after telling them ive been doing the same price for ever they accused me of lying not going back|i must tell you about my stay at this property i have not been to las vegas in many years and excited to come may actually move there my family booked  rooms for the stay first night stay everything great on my second and third day i left the room at  am returned at  pm and the room was not made up had to call and request that they comerd night there was in room when had power outage contacted front desk and was told to stay in room this deprived me of going out to a late dinner and catching some live music along with possible gamingi do stay at many hilton properties and they strive for a higher standard and guest satisfaction your property fell below my and i am sure hiltons standard of excellence|dr keller spent very little time listening to my daughters concerns on her very first solo visit to a gynecologist she dismissed concerns she had about being tested for a certain condition even though her primary care physician and dermatologist both said she should be tested and said it was just probably hereditary she spent most of the time talking about a birth control pill only available in mexico and asked if my daughter knew anyone there that could send it to her and that would be the best prescription for her  my daughter had to stop her from leaving the room to say she still hadnt asked all the questions she wanted to dr keller prescribed a medication and said she would call it in but didnt they charged us twice as much for the initial visit but did no special tests and was dismissive and rude before considering this doctor be sure and read all the reviews on yelp you will see very very few glowing reportswish i had done my yelp research before i put my daughter through this humiliating and frustrating firsttime experience at a gynecologist|this is for a visit from october  a big group of us were in town for an event and made reservations at pier  for a group dinner the service was not good at all we were  people separated into multiple tables it took a while for the waiter to come and take our orders and to bring us our drinks then things got worse when it started to rain obviously the restaurant cannot control that but what they can control is them helping us and they didnt we had to move the tables ourselves underneath the limited area that was covered and at one point the waiter was just standing there watching us scramble and move the tables and didnt even do anything when the food came it was cold and dry and when we asked for our check the waiter offered separate bills for each table which we gladly accepted since she offered and then later when we expressed concern about how long the bill took the owner came out and said it took so long because we asked for separate checks hmm lets rewind there the waiter offered so we gladly accepted otherwise we all had cash to pay for the bill my last comment is that i honestly think this restaurant shouldnt have taken our reservation because they were not equipped to serve such a big party|vs is a pretty good barber shop i get my hair cut here frequently and they do a great job with that said i am often frustrated at their initial customer service when you walk in i am never greeted and if there is a queue of people they do not take your name down or give you an indication of how long the wait is this is particularly problematic when there are a number of scheduled appointments a great haircut is only half of the experience you have to make the customer feel valued from the time they arrive until they leave if the guy that is doing the cleanup would pay attention to incoming customers instead of talking to the barbers that would be a start|i was very disappointed in my visit today from looking at others reviews it seems like archis takeout service is horrible i can definitely agree when i called this afternoon no one picked up the phone i called again and placed my order at  the lady said she will see me in  minutes we got there at  the food should have been ready by then right we waiting until almost  to get our food i placed my order almost an hour ago my boyfriend had to wave down a server  times i ordered spicy level  and  on my dishes and they were not spicy at all portions were lacking for paying over  dollars for  pad thai dish ive dined in here before and it actually replaced thai style noodle house for a while dont think i will be coming back though|went for a nice family dinner seemed like a good place from familyfriends as soon as we walked in we were ignored by the waitresses  we waited got seated and everyone around us including people who got there after us were being helped except us didnt try the food because we left overall customer service was awful|for the kids its great especially since they have one free kids meal on tuesdays but the chef was not able to get my order right i asked for a well done steak and he sent it out medium rare  sent it back to cook some more and it was still pink and the outside was charred no bueno|im a dutch brothers fan this location disappointed me though walked up to order my drink waited in a line and wasnt unhappy to do so what i wasnt cool with was when i watched three of the employees shotgun energy drinks from aluminum cans inside they all three had blue rebel cans they poked holes in the side placed to their mouth popped that soda tab open and chugged two of them even threw their cans to the ground in typical frat boy fashion it was incredible to watch to be honest like the defiant hold onto your youth part of me wanted to cheer but the adult in me was like i would hate if i was the manager of this shop knowing my employees were acting that way and so i reviewed i get db has a funny environment but i dont think this is what they had in mind|i was new to az and didnt have a primary doctor yet i went into urgent care  times a week apart the first time they said it was acid reflex i went in a week later with my knees down to my feet so swollen and red spots all over them i was in so much pain could hardly walk my feet were turning purple i have never experienced anything like this they told me i was having an allergic reaction in reality i have valley fever seriously they are there for a quick fix but i had no idea what valley fever was or what was going on go to the emergency room over this place  they dont know what they are doing|take my advice and save your trip to mt everest the food was horrible we were a party of  and each one including our two kids did not like the food the chicken dishes felt like it was from last night the only thing i can say about the yelp reviews are that it can be bought oh btw chicken drumsticks with food coloring is not tandoori chickenthe only thing positive was the price and their service|so disappointed in vegas last few days wanted to do one nice buffet without breaking the bank i did a lot of research on multiple sites i was with  companions who are gluten free so wanted to make sure that they had enough choices many yelp and other reviews mentioned this buffet as one that had a lot of gf options general consensus was that the food was good neither was true  first of all if youre going within the next couple of weeks beware  the price is not whats listed on the website dinner monthurs   yes theres an asterisk that says that prices may vary during holiday weeks  maybe it was there last week and i just missed it but i sure missed it so it was quite a shock to hear that  buffets with the unlimited pour alcohol came to about  of course we could have left but it was after  at night we were very hungry and my elderly relative just could not walk any more you have to walk through what feels like a mile of aria to get to the buffet  so okay it will be our big splurge mealwow what a mistake  there were a few items that were good one or two that were okay and quite a few that were not good at all nothing outstandingthe service was good our server was attentive and friendly but it didnt come close to making up for the food beef steamship and shrimp were good clams tiny manila clams were fine mussels were not so good crab legs were well buffet crab legs salad bar wasnt huge but was fine premade salads looked great but were mostly pretty bad vegetables  tasteless salmon and baked chicken  dry and tasteless leg of lamb  grey and hard not a great flavor mashed potatoes  how do you mess up mashed potatoes by putting in way too much salt and we are a group that likes salt they also looked dried out like theyd been sitting there all night crawfish  horrible inedible i spit it out  desserts meh nothing particularly great creme brulee was okay gelato was okay but its not self serve so you cant take tiny amounts of several to see what you like gluten free options my mistake perhaps but when i hear that a place has gluten free options i dont think that means they have rice and salad of course those are gluten free duh but i expected more there is gluten free pizza if you ask for it the pizza guy seemed quite taken aback by the request but made one for us it was fine woo hoo gluten free desserts were gelato some flavors others had pretzels or cookies or whatever creme brulee and i think a chocolate mousse thats it we asked the lady serving gelato if any desserts were gluten free she was clearly trying to help us but clearly english was not her first second or any number language her response was spoons on table oh well  it was a fun trip anyway|i try thai restaurants in every city i visit this was by far one of the worst i have come across i mean the thai restaurants in strip malls just outside vegas serve way better food than this place penang curry was bland for some reason the chicken was very chewy on both our entrees and my friend did not feel good afterwards jasmine rice is not served with any entrees even though they cost about  go to this place only if no other restaurant is open after midnight save your money and make some time to visit lotus of siam instead|went to buy a charger for my ipad i was asked if i needed help said yes associate looked at the ipad on display said he had never seen it and walked away when i saw him again he said he had called someone to help me nobody ever showed while he decided to go talk to his buddy their slogan should not include the words expert service but should include the words help yourself because nobody here will|they close at pm not  and wont talk to you after  horrible service they dont care about making the sale with ready and willing buyers because they clock out right at pm and yelp needs to fix the hours of operation so people dont waste their time|of course we had to try ha long due to the massive amount of highly rated reviews on yelp  we didnt realize how long the wait would be on a friday night either but we toughed it out and waited an hour for our table  too bad this wait was not worth it  once we looked at the menu we noticed that the cuisine is not strictly vietnamese or thai but rather a combination of items from south east asia  we were totally ok with this itll be nice to have choices  we decided to stick with viet items and had the crispy fried seafood noodles and a bowl of pho  the wait for food also took a long time and sadly was a disappointmentboth the noodle choices were unimpressive in presentation and less so in taste  the crispy noodles were plentiful but not crispy  the sauce was plain and the toppings overcooked  weve definitely had better crispy noodles elsewhere  then we tried the pho and was just saddened by it  broth was lazy and ingredients lacking especially for a special  maybe we shouldve had thai or laos food from this place but we doubt wed be coming back  the food was just not to our liking|i wanted so bad for this to be amazing it was about  minutes before closing and we were taking our stuff to go despite this they were still annoyed we were there the ice cream was beyond old and freezer burned it wasnt even edible and the boys ended up trashing it the cupcake had hard frosting that had to be old as well the cake part of it was fine but the frosting was not it was very expensive for us to not even want to eat it and we probably will not be back|by far the dirtiest store i have ever seenalso the bathrooms looked liked they havent been cleaned in years  actual poop on the walls nasty sticky floors so nasty  never again will i go to that location   gross|food is absolutely terrible ate three bites and gave up staff was ok until i clearly wasnt liking the food then got ignored wanted to give them a higher rating due to service alone but that fell short at the end over priced and bad service too bad they cant do better good location|slow ass drive through seriously l poor service  poor management have the car park in the parking to get their food the place is empty and it takes  min just to get service|other workers in the nail place seemed very nice but the lady i had vivian was very rude did not talk and she didnt give me what i asked for and got attitude when i told her i did not want gel nail she rushed thru the whole thing |poor showing by the membership services and management as an active duty service member i went home for  days to las vegas to visit my family before a deployment i have a super sport membership but my gf only has a sport we requested to use this gym for her but were told no then we were told only if we paid  extra for each use no well if you pay the difference for this month or a reasonable price per visit or hey were sorry its against our policy but there are sport locations here and here it was the rudest staff ive ever had the pleasure of meeting at a  hour sorely disappointed|the store is looking very bare lots of empty racks also messy huge piles of clothing everywhere the first  registers i went to had signs to go to childrens for a register standing in line i was wondering why my internet didnt work i saw i was on macys free wifi i turned it off and used my data the free wifi is basically no wifi dont bother ill stick with dillards|my daughters chicken fingers were better than our meal the hulas in ca is far superior underwhelmed by the pork sandwich|very disappointing there are so many better things to spend your time and money on while in vegas no reservation is needed my boyfriend and i walked in and started right away the tour is not guided you walk through different stations beginning with the crime scene and moving onto the labs however the labs are not real labs most of the labs are at computer screens where basically you just press next next next finish to get the answer you need or move around other interactive pieces im sure its intended to be dummie proof but some thinking would have been nice the experience was just cheesy then at the end you get your diploma and take graduation pics but you have to pay more none of that was included in the original charge the reviews for this were decent so we decided to try it out overall this was not worth the time or money spent and i would advise others to spend theirs elsewhere|empty on a cold afternoon first bad sign more expensive than most other locations on the strip second bad sign there were literally no customers in the store when i went in and the two employees present did not greet me or even look remotely interested when i went to order i ordered a caramel brulee latte and a peppermint mocha latte both were almost tasteless and lukewarm i also asked if they did the holiday sticker card and the cashier gave me a nasty look and said no|outside service was slow the bill wasnt added right and they were out of bananas for my pancakes probably wont be back but it may have just been a bad time|food is fine and service inside is fine too but it is the worse drive thru i have ever been in  there was only  cars in front of me and it took over a half hour to get through it  even when i got to the box to place by order no one even talked to me for  minutes most places acknowledge you and if they are too busy they tell you they will be with you soon avoid the drive thru unless you have tons of time and gas to waste|horrible company  how do you run a limo service that does not even have their limo in service  completely ruined a very special christmas suprise for my girlfriend who has never had a limo rides before  thanks for nothing|i scheduled the christmas lights tour for  to go to mcadenville the day before the trip i became ill but a neighbor took my place only one of the passengers who sat in the front seat could see the lights the windows were darkly tinted so the passengers in the second seats had to roll down the window to see and it was a cold night the three passengers in the back saw nothing because of the side panel on the van and the head rest in the front i called twice and sent two emails and finally spoke to a woman who said she was the manager but no one really cared it was an expensive trip and i felt responsible since i arranged it i would not recommend them for any event they clearly have no concern for their customers|ordered chicken with garlic sauce  theres no reason why the chicken was red  we also ordered the wonton egg drop soup which was bland and had yellow food coloring  note to selfwill not be a repeat customer|read a lot of good reviews before i went unfortunately i cant say the same wont be backsee carolyns review|ughhh probably the worst smoothie ever id give this place  stars if i could the people who work here obviously think jobs are easy to come by  certainly their attitudes reflected that with sassy mouthed sideways glancing actions if i owned this franchise and saw their behavior  let alone saw them constantly on their cell phonesi would have a nice coming to jesus chat and some retraining of the attitude or id be bootscootin boogying their hineys right outta the place|i guess you learn the most about a business when things are at their busiestmost challenging i realize i went on a day right before the holidays and if i had i been a walkin i would absolutely have no right to complain but i wasnt i called earlier in the day and made an appointment i asked for an earlier time but the technician said to come in at four after no one said anything to me with my feet soaking for  minutes i left none of the nail

i must have come on a good day because i do not remember waiting too long  i was asked to be on the medical trial for a new psoriasis medication that required injections every  weeks  i was to be paid  tax free a visit  it took almost  months to receive my first check and then received a notification from dr bettencourt that i had to claim it on my taxes  also after  months of minimal results i expressed my concern to the doctor  she curtly replied that i was getting paid for this and being given free topicals  said topicals were trial size and lasted a few days only  during one of the biweekly visits i asked dr bettencourt to look at this mole on my leg  she said i would have to make a regular appointment for her to look at it even though she was already in the room with me and my pants were off to check the psoriasis  at the end of the trial after being seen by the doctor i asked for a prescription for a topical for my psoriasis  i was told i would have to make an appointment to be seen by the doctor  i pointed out that i had just come out of the office after being seen and was advised that that appointment was for the trial not for my psoriasis  bottom line dr bettencourt is rude and cheap  and my psoriasis is worse now than before|i went in last tuesday at  and asked for a gel mani there were  other customers in the lobby and  nail techs working after my request the

the next time i came in i just wanted to get out of there so i left her a check i was really angry after i left because i just should have walked away and not left her anything and i should have asked

to be someone to fix broken mailboxes asap so there is not this much inconvenience|i rarely find myself at the post office so when the time comes that im forced to visit its hard to give them positive feedback when it also happens to be one of the busiest days of the year i received a notice that something i ordered for the holiday arrived and required a signature for me to obtain it i couldnt think what it might be but i trekked out to the post office only to drive in circles around the parking lot for  minutes looking for a spot and then when i finally enter the building see a line wrapped around the entire interior of people waiting in the exact line i needed the line moved slowly and i overheard employees with somewhat bad attitudes escalate interactions that could have gone much better with a slightly more cheerful  tone of voice on their end its frustrating to hear since i know what a bad rap the postal service gets and i cant help but feel frustrated to see these stereotypes lived out in real life one lady at the window helping the enormous line while the other shorter line was manned by several different employees all i could do was watch inefficiency all around finally someone thought to help out and take some folks from the longer line to help expedite but it definitely took longer than it should have|ordered the toro sashimi and it was the worst

take  hours to resolve meanwhile the christmas gifts i ordered are in a locked box in front of my home and i cant get them how is it possible the post office cant open a bin that they locked no wonder the post office is in trouble a private company providing this kind of service would be out of business by now|so the food had gone down since i was there last but i thought that maybe it was just an off day so i went back monday  and waited in line for  mins when i got to order i was told they were out of brisket pork and ribs so all they had was chicken and hot links i left with nothing i tried again tonight waited in line again and was told when i ordered ribs they were out same story as monday some surprise order came in i walked out and wont be back as someone who is in customer service

her nailsagain ive had very good scalp massage  so i told her to move on to my arms and do the reflexology that i thought i would be getting  it was apparent to me that she didnt what she was doingand

scottsdale hospital told us to go see the criticalist at this hospital  the staff was pleasant but  of the doctors there had terrible bedside manors  so at this hospital they treated one of the illnesses and neglected the most important one a tumor  after almost  weeks of care in the hospital and keeping her doped up on pain meds which we found out later she wasnt in pain with no improvement and over  later we wanted to know what was going on  they basically gave us  choices we can leave her there to be treated further and maybe shell get better or we can take her home and put her to sleep  they were more than happy to keep milking us for more money but we opted to take her out of there and seek other medical attention  days later we found another dr who has won many prestigious awards through a friend which examined her and agreed she wasnt in pain but that she did have a tumor that could be treated with the proper meds at first and further treatment later  unfortunately on the way home from his office she suffered a seizure in the car and aspirated on her vomit and had trouble breathing so we couldnt see her suffer any moreour little girl was an unbelievable fighter she had amazed many doctors in the past how she overcome any illness in the past with the proper care from the right drs us and her willingness to live for usshe is deeply missed by us and all of those who had the opportunity to know hertheres nothing that can be done now so to what purpose does it serve for me to contact your office manager they slipped up in her care and people should be made

just a madison thing but ive had several interactions with some pretty pompous employees at this location  on one occasion we were pretty much harassed by two folks that didnt seem to want our business at all  not really sure why as weve been regular members for about  years now  maybe its the aloof nature the area has been developing lately but its enough for me to refrain from doing any

had spaghetti and meatballs  its was the worst meal weve had at olive garden  the only reason we sat and ate everything is because we were starving|very disappointed id rather go other one my family

if i could the security staff at this club is horribly rude and power hungry the bouncers here are complete pricks came here on a saturday  and i got my group on the guest list before pm and when we were at the front after  minutes of waiting the bouncer grabs our slip and says okay  girls  guys he doesnt even count and lets some random girl slip through screwing up the ratio for our group after seeing that our group numbers were off he prevented  members of our group from entering and starts cussing and yelling at my friends and kicks them out of line after a hour fiasco of frantically trying all the other possibilities of getting the rest of our group in before guest list ended at  my friends were running around cosmo getting different instructions from another bouncer who lied to them about getting  free comps for being a hotel guest just to shoo them away and finally went from speaking to the front desk receptionists the resort manager and finally the hotel manager who escorted them to the front and finally got them in around am the  flights of stairs up to this club are completely unaccommodating as well stairs stairs stairs and more damn stairs everywhere my night was  stairs walking up to marquee was like taking a trek to egypt after running up and down the stairs frantically trying to get the rest of my group up i started getting a little belligerent in my  inch heels the idea of being intoxicated in  inch heels and climbing and going down stairs isnt exactly an enticing one the stairs arent fancy club stairs eitherits like the ones you use during a fire escape whats worse than walking up a gajillion flights of stairs is finally getting into a venue that completely sucks this club is jam packed with sweaty people lost half our group again cause they cut people off from the pit not a very enjoyable club and i have nightmares of coming backthey shouldve known they were fckin with the yelp elite when they gave us problems at the door |i remember years ago when this location opened and how excited i was  our family has been getting our subs here since  ive been a fan since eating at the original nj shore location decades ago  after tonight ill be hard pressed to return  the giant turkey and provolone sub my wife purchased was about  in of lettuce with a few slices of meat cheese and tomato added  to put this in perspective subways been known for single layer meat and cheesethis was that bad or worse  you could only really taste the lettucesadthis wasnt just a poor sub in jersey mikes terms it was simply one of the worst sandwiches ive ever hadsimply a disappointment|its not so secret when you have long lines and wait times of  minutes   hour  what does seem like a secret is the menu  the menu board is not in a prominent place so you really dont know what is available until you get to the counter  you can add toppings but everything is hidden so you have to ask for specific things to be added to your plain slicethe pizza is inexpensive tasty and pizzanothing super special or out of the ordinary  if i was staying at the hotel i would probably order a whole pizza and eat it in the room no seating but until then i wont be returning|we ordered a refrigerator from this store and we will never ever use sears again their store representative did not know what she was going and instead of directing us online she called customer service in our behalf but wouldnt let us place the order through them because she wanted the commission so we ended up paying  more which she said they would refund and they havent i have tried to click through in my order receipt to get updates and more information but all of their links are broken and website is terrible i have been on a call with the sears customer service line for almost  minutes over  of which are on hold and yet sears sends me not one but two satisfaction surveys both of which i completed and i have received no further follow up|horrible horrible food it was gross service was great but the food was disgusting not what u expected or asked for the service was good though reeked of alcohol not for families|i waited forever to try this place me and a gf went one evening it was quite busy i got some kind of croissant sandwich there menu wasnt huge it matched the limited seating in the small restaurant usually that means prepare for something special i expected more i guess the food was ok to me they did have some craft beer available the staff wasnt very welcoming though one girl literally just stared at us as we entered the restaurant and waited for us to order not the greatest position to be in when its busy and you have a line behind you especially when its youre first time here one guy seemed very optimistic working though anyhow i wasnt overall amazed if i find myself in the areai will try this place again and update this review perhaps its the breakfast alcohol or mimosas that they are known for|i worked basically with a secretary for  months and never talked with the actual attorney she told me to go off and do a bunch of stuff and get additional medical information done which all came back and supported the claim then after all this time the attorney looked at the case and declined it based on stuff i told her originally that has nothing to do with all the information and testing gathered wasted a bunch of my time and money and didnt make any sense never did talk with the attorney  i think there just wasnt enough money in it for him and they made stuff up which i got from the secretary as well|a den of used car salesmen and liars do not ever shop here i received two emails directly from verizon informing me of a great deal that my specific account was now eligible for as an upgrade along with a tradein  we went to this store because its corporate and the salesman assigned to us was not only a douche he flat out lied to us actually told me that the promo was not available and that the email and the mailer i received were false so verizon sends me bullshit promos yes  you dont understand how this works ok so it works like this  you send me a promo to get me to come to the store just so you can sell me something full price with no discount  he shrugged and wagged his head with a yes wtf  i was so mad at wasting my time waiting there that i didnt even care to get the manager and call this guy out on his sales scam technique yeah ok you offer me  off but ill just ignore that and give you  for a phone anyways because i am as dumb as you think i am or hope i am since when did selling cell phones literally become a usedcar racket the balls of this guy to stand there in the store run by the corporation and flat out lie to the customers well i went home and called the  on the email and connected with sales and the guy on the phone immediately hooked me up with a brand new phone off as the promo promised wow they kept their word i told him about the experience at the store and he said thats not uncommon at that location  they make more sales off the phone than at the actual location because they hire scumbag salesmen who refuse to honor verizons corporate offers so they can make a bigger commission i will never go this or any verizon store again doing this over the phone with corporate directly was supremely more convenient efficient and affordable gave me the deal i wanted and i got the phone sent to me free overnight salesman on the phone a salesman at this store location favoid these scumbag scam artists at all costs they will lie to your face rant over|went there last night for an engagement the place has great ambiance and the staff were nice we ordered most of the menu to share so there was opportunity to try most of their dishes unfortunately the portions were small the food was average and it was really really expensive for what you get the fried chicken was excellent  in a class of its own the rest of the food was disappointing looked great but the flavours were bland and were missing salt andor spices the tartare smelled fishy  this was a huge let down this is a miss if you are looking for the great food that our city is known for it is not here|too much wait and not worth it at all the arrangement and cleaning is not sufficient at all and the reception girl is so rude the sushi we ordered at the very beginning came when we almost finished everything the raw seafood is not so fresh worst japanese restaurant experience ever|no donuts left at am not happy service was good but no donuts and smoothies too sweet|marie and her crew started off with satisfactory service  they charge  to clean a  bedroom  bathroom apartment in tempe which is about  sq ft  we try to leave the girls a little extra most times to express our gratitude  however that will no longer be happening after the job that was done today  this company made  in less than an hour for service that was far from mediocre  the floors were not cleaned counters were unwashed and a hair was left in the microwave  this is the type of service nobody should have to tolerate and we will no longer be using this company for any cleaning service  you will likely have some good results to start but unless you stay at home to make sure the job is done each visit the results will not last  given on how poorly this company did today and the amount of money we paid for a service that was not even close to being fulfilled i do not recommend this company at all|the salon was cute my hair looked horrific like i was stuck in a windstorm while standing still wont ever go back or recommend this place to a damn soul gonna have to go and fix it myself before my holidays pictures thanks a lot|i took my family here in a desperate attempt for better health at the time we had  young children and all of us were getting cold after cold and we couldnt figure out what the reason was at the end of our rope and on a high recommendation from a friend we decided to try them out thinking just maybe it was allergies we were tested using their techniques and they informed us we were all allergic to multiple things  dogs cats horses trees food etc where i started to doubt their system is when it just so happened that the combination of allergies we each had couldnt be treated together and we had to have multiple visits we spent close to  for the  of us after it was all said and done we experienced no relief from our allergies they retested us and we were supposedly cured of all our initial allergies yet we felt the exact same red flags popped up during our friends testimony of their services she told us her son was tested and was allergic to water she said they never noticed any side effect from water  but paid for treatment and this chiropractors test showed he was cured and they were ecstatic i should have known then but we were desperate i believe this place has no data to back up their claims i wanted two different chiros to test me to see if they both came up with the same allergies but they would not because that would expose their scam my recommendation dont but into their pseudo science and if you are seeking allergy relief go somewhere else that is proven by more than anecdotal evidence that could have saved my family lots of money heartaches and waster time|this place is terrible we had them clean our condo while we were away the place wasnt dirty  we just wanted it professionally cleaned they left dirty dishes in the sink didnt scrub the tub and didnt wipe out the refrigerator like we requested we will never use them again ive updated this review and have given them another star the owner contacted me and tried to make things right they offered to reclean our place but since were not in town often we opted for a refund i really appreciate that they did try to fix things|dont trust the commercial video its not like that the place needs to be cleaned and revamped food was not good too sorry|we frequent the location on gilbert and germann and have always been happy with our experience last night we were in the area of alma school and queen creek so decided to eat at this location we walked in and my first impression was that the dining room looked dingy and dirty no one greeted us at the door we stood waiting for approximately five minutes i could see one waiter kneeling on a booth bench deep in conversation with some diners he never looked over at the door i walked over to the bar only saw one person working and no one acknowledged us i went back over the dining room approached the waiter who was kneeling on the bench and asked him if we should seat ourselves since there were now two parties waiting to be seated he was polite and seated us and the other party right away everyone that we encountered was polite but the service was slow the food was cold and the floor appeared to be dirty i feel that management needs to get a grip on what is happening at this location i wont visit this location again|first let me begin by saying that this place is not worth the hypei came for a holiday dinner with a group of  it was evident that the server failed to put my order in as it came out  minutes later than everyone else the noodles in my dish were not fully cooked and the pasta dish was nothing to even rant about if the courses are on the more expensive end i would expect the quality of service and food to match the price tag unfortunately this place does notif you are looking for a dinner spot downtown there are plenty other options with much better food and less expensive|the ladies that work at this location are nothing but disrespectful and rude i always go to the one at metro and i love that place because of the people who work there the ladies at this location have always given my problems every time ive come in i put my name down on the list and asked how long it would be and she told me  min so i went and got a couple things around the mall came back and my name was passed up so she told me after this customer we can take you then the other lady refused and said the customers will get mad well what the f am i to you am i not a customer is that what your trying to say you dont want to get them mad but im the one getting mad here causing a scene telling my mother that she doesnt even wanna talk to her because she reminds her of her mother excuse me im a manager in customer service and that by far is the worst customer service experience ive had in a long time i am never going back those girls are pathetic  trust me thats not the only bad experience ive had there|can i give them zero stars i came in to cash one of their money orders and were rudely told they had to check first if it was any good okay i know people can forger anything it took them  minutes to verify if it was good this was done by the supervisor because one of the others postal workers notified us that that they didnt have to cadh it especially anything over  what its a post office money orderthe supervisor finally comes back and says its good but we cant cash it we dont have any money we asked if she had check to which she replied i dont have to but im sure we dont have any money people only pay with debit nowadays okay but do you know for a fact no but no im not checkingso we asked for her name yo which she replied all you need to know is that im the supervisor here i dont have to give you my name we asked for a badge number or anything to identify her and she said she didnt have to give us any information except that she was the supervisor and worked for the united states post office a government job and the rest was not our businessthen she said she was done with us was not going to answer any more questions and to leaveto find some other place that would and could cash the money order all we wanted was a valid answer when we asked again for someone higher than her she said we were bring obnoxious with our  question that she didnt have to help us and didnt want to help us and to leave its horrible to think that shes proud to say that she works for the united states post office  a government job while saying screw you i dont care nor want to help you get the fuck out of my post office|lobster me more like lobster no me we used to love this place pricey but well worth it not anymore small lobster roll  tiny pieces of dried out fish an

suggest you save your time and go eat elsewhere they also cant seem to ever get orders right either its no wonder why there have been a few locations that have closed down permanently ill just stick

expecting to be cleaned were ignored  we were charged  and the house was just as dirty after they left very disappointing look elsewhere for a real cleaning service this company cleaned less than what i can do on a daily basis by myself|un endroit qui fait pauvre dans la deco mais les oeufs benedictines sont delicieux il me semble que cela demandrait un petit effort de decoration et de mobilier et

with im a single mother with two kids and my support system consists of only my parents here in the valley from the moment i walked through the door the cretin that calls herself barbara was insanely rude and damn near condescending instead of saying unfortunately the kids cant be present and explaining their policy nicely she starts by glaring at me and looking at my children and saying we cant give you your drug test today and seeing that i was thrown back and confused thinking maybe they werent doing that today said why she said my kids couldnt go with me by law uh yeah terrible parents ruin it for all but its ok it takes all of a minute to pee in a cup so i say its ok i wont take them to the restroom with me she again gets snarky and say we wont watch them im not asking for that but i explained further that right now theres no place for them to be because my only support system my mom was in an accident sunday and the girls would sit still she continued to be rude until i handed my keys to my oldest and had her take the little one to the car the cretin then responds with her higher than mighty tone well if thats what youre going to do its a good thing they make you wait forever to pee in a cup because at least it let me have time to forewarn people labcorp always sucks but go to a different one just so you dont have to deal with the one they call barbara|i had a crosscountry move using uboxes and uhaul associated move helpers on both ends of the movehere is what moveaholics my uhaul associated phoenix az move helper did wrong  they allowed an employee who did not have his dl on his person to go to uhaul to pick up my ubox their office staff swear that the man has a valid license and had lost it without notifying them clearly some valid license was presented for this person because he later arrived at my location with a ubox in tow the only other suggestion i would make for the moving helpers would be to make the time frame for the work clearer i thought it was am when it was a range of aahere is what moveaholics did right  they kept in touch with me answered my questions and concerns quickly were courteous and friendly and answered the phone they worked very hard to satisfy my stated needs and desires and in the end their manager delivered my furniture on his day off in order to make sure i did not have to wait one minute longer than necessaryhere is what moveaholics is not responsible for but for which they are apparently being blamed by the gm at the uhaul location th  bell once the license issue was resolved they were given empty uboxes by the uhaul location to deliver and then were blamed when they didnt notify uhaul of the mistake the boxes sat in the parking lot of my apartment complex because i had to go to work  since the mornings screw ups lasted passed the planned delivery window  and none of us knew they were empty until i got there after work between  and pm this despite the gm knowing i had  loaded boxes at his location my actual uboxes were not able to be delivered on my promised scheduled and confirmed date because the uhaul location had not unloaded them from whatever they were on traveling to az my boxes tracked be delivered to the bell  th location on the  days before my delivery was scheduled because the uhaul location had not unloaded my boxes they could not meet my delivery day mr gm did not answer his phone calls to the location required i leave a message with a woman who could not answer any questions and then wait for mr gm to call me back  i think the rest of the shenanigans were so they could cover their lack of performance frankly the gm lied to me more than once and also told me i should cancel the moveaholics and schedule a different move helper i think he did this so he could conceal the fact that my load was not ready on the promised day he cost me a day of work hours all told and cost moveaholics the hours spent in vain on my delivery on friday the man should be fired he filed a claim on my behalf without my permission and apparently attempted to require the move helper to pay for the paltry  uhaul sent me my total uhaul bill was just under  and he is wrong do not trust this uhaul location in general pertaining to the uboxes i would wait before trying this option uhaul in general is disorganized around who can adjust schedules answer questions and respond to calls related to ubox activities and the site needs a little better interactivity to accomplish the various options presented lastly the boxes do not hold nearly what the staff will tell you they doi will not do a move this way again thats for sure and i would never use the bell  th location for anything never|this is the worst post office in the usa i travel for

went to the post office and filled out the yellow paper twicethe second timei went to the post office and the lady behind the brown door told me ill go look for your shit if i spoke to my clients like

decided that having a meal at gordon ramsay steak was a must do  we were all staying right next door at ballys so why not  so we contacted our host at paris who was fantastic by the way and he was able to get us a reservation for six people on halloween night which was also a saturday night we were all very excited  we were seated upstairs in the private room  all good  although we would have preferred downstairs in the main dining area  felt there was more ambiance downstairs  we are all fairly young and wanted to take in the entirety of the restaurant not shuffled away like we needed to be away from people  our waiter oliver was pleasant enough knowledgeable and attentive at first  however his first mistake was not getting my husband his drink right away  big mistake  the waiters response to my husbands inquiry he was waiting for the rest of the drink orders from the table what my husband ordered a beer  he was furious which was obvious to all except for the waiter  he still didnt bring the beer right away  we all ordered our respective meals without difficulty my husband and another guest were both fixated on having the short rib dish  i prefer fish so i ordered the sea bass  after the meals came my girlfriend asked that i taste her short rib dish because she thought it had a funny taste  so i tried it and then i tried by husbands  two dishes two different flavors  hers tasted burnt  it was awful  my husbands dish was definitely better  flavorful but surprisingly the short ribs were very fatty  my girlfriend did not enjoy her meal at all  as for my sea bass  disappointing i can describe this dish in two words overcooked and dry  the best part of the meal was the side dishes  we ordered the brussels sprouts and maccheese to share and overall everyone enjoyed them  my husband and i have plans to visit las vegas in may  not sure if we would even dare to return to gordon ramsay  even for a drink|if you like choppy tv slowerthandialup internet and

my taste even if i was able to return this meat it should never made it to my plate like that that plate is a signature dish and should never be prepared and served like this in my opinion great atmospheric and comfortable environment wish there was a manager on duty that asked me how the food was just a bunch of kids last saturday at pm if i could i would have given this  stars as my sandwich and coleslaw and water was over  and was near inedible lots of bbq choices one right next door you guys need to get your quality control in order and make sure your manager is more proactive

however is definitely not representative of good german food or food in general    pretty certain the schnitzel is from frozen and sides like sauerkraut leave a lot to be desired|do not purchase a yelp deal for fuego i purchased my first one a few weeks back along with a few other coworkers  each deal had our name on it  out of  of us went to get the orders that were each placed separately it was a taller gentleman who tried to tell us that he would not accept our deals because not all  of us were there  he ended up taking our deals but was quite rude about it  a coworker and myself both each got another yelp deal today another coworker placed an order with no deal  we get there and the dark haired shorter gentleman was rude off the bat  he said you can not use a yelp deal on to go orders  i explained we had not had this issue before  he refused to accept our deals  i paid for the non yelp deal order  no where on the deal does it specify that you have to dine in i could not believe how absolutely rude he was beyond rude|brides please beware dont let this happen to you save your breath and moneyi went in for a scheduled consult for bridal flowers i came in with my mother

florist look up flowers by richard|i am writing this review in regards to centurylink and not a specific store i live in the phoenix az metro area and i will say this if you have other options explore them i have had payments not applied taken from my bank account electronically mind you i have had representatives hang up on me and i have had the usual misinformed or notverywelltrained customer service agents constantly as recently as november centurylink processed a payment from my bank account then sent me a notice stating they could not locate my account wait what yes you read that correctly next ive been working for  weeks to have them apply the payment they took yet they continually lose the information i send them next ive had multiple and i mean multiple customer service agents hang up on me or send me back to the generic call queue because they did not know how to fix my problem i promise it is not due to rudeness on my part i actually have a record of speaking to  representatives in an hour and a half trying to get me to the right departmentneedless to say i never spoke to the correct person no customer service agent in their customerservice area seems to know what theyre doing i understand many companies have scripts etc that they utilize but when i say this i mean they are contradictory and literally typically have no clue you really need to dot your is and cross your ts when dealing with customer service i recommend using the online chat version and having every chat emailed to you for your records youll need them when you cancel service this department and area is in the negative stars on a  scale as for the techs and the tech support group theyre great every single tech ive had sent to my house for issues has astounded me with their knowledge of any issue ive had at one point i had a tech at my home for  hours bonding a circuit and rewiring somethingin the middle of july im in az remember he actually called in and spoke to managers due to the mess that was created with my internet service and complete disarray of equipment and wiring etc  i wrote to his manager as well as called the company to comment on this guy seriously he was great these guys are like a  star ratingtech support hard to understand but if you go stepbystep with them they typically can help with troubleshooting and basic equipment issues id give them a  star rating|dont believe the hype good variety but expensive and the food is average can get better food in vegas eating somewhere else for |vegasbuffet|i would add an extra star and come

and delivering orders is so difficult maybe youre in the wrong business my husband put in the order for food on grubhub at pm and we were told that it was accepted and being made at  they said that the latest we would get our food which is ridiculous but what can you do was  keep in mind that we tipped  in advance without waiting to see what the service was going to be like apparently a mistake at  im kind of wondering where the food is because seriously weve ordered from other asian places that are way farther away and gotten really good food within  minutes needing over an hour is pretty ludicrous we tried calling the number three times on each of our phones and it seemed to be shut off not very professional finally get through at  and someone very bluntly asked me what my address was and then the only detail i got was its already out for delivery you will have it in minutes at  we get a call from the delivery driver asking for directions my husband gave him simple directions to follow but he simply couldnt comprehend them so my husband ended up having to go out to the street to meet the delivery driver to get our food it took from  to  to get the food and they couldnt even get it to our door at least the food is amazingly still hot i dont recommend this place unless you want to pay a delivery person money when you have to deliver your own food to yourself i will say though that the food was pretty good the stars are for the process and delivery|so yeah we were walking through montreal really hungry and we knew that this will be just another tourist trap  and it

also left in the middle of our conversation without a word the rd girl was ok but im glad i verified my items before paying they gave me the wrong cocktail shaker and the wrong jigger i wish the service was better i would have definitely gone back but im going to try other stores the service is really not up to the price tag|totally average  i think they may have been understaffed the night

comes to the downtown grand hotel and casino they tell you that parking is validated for free if you gamble with  bucks then once you accomplish this and ask for the validated parking they not only deny you but laugh in your face for believing such a gullible tall tale in a town where service and overall experience is king you would think that common courtesy and a sense of customer service would be a given but again not at the downtown grand hotel and casino we had actually been warned from friends to stay away but we didnt head their warnings this mistake will not be made again the only good thing i can say is that the cocktail waitresses were nice but again i must stress please please stay away|seriously this place has become a joke i have lived here going on three years and the past  months have been horrible here new management takes over paints the apartments unmatching ridiculous colors to start recently they sent out an email about a situation that occurred the beginning of december to clarify that the incident  a stabbing  did not originally occur on property come to find out was a total lie and that the two females who actually stabbed the man did live on property and were running a prostitution ring out of their apartment question is why i send out an email to your residents if its all a lie come to find out now theres a guy driving around the apartment complex asking for sexual favors residents of the apartment complex going around asking people for money and constantly fighting in the parking lot police here every night and a security guard that they do not even allow to be armed on property the office staff just tells everyone what they want to hear i dont know how they expect people to even feel safe here i cannot wait till my lease is up  this place is the definition of a joke and i will clarify this now im not a mad resident writing this review just want to save people that are going to potentially move in here save yourself spend a little bit more money on your rent trust me its worth it|so ive been to five guys a couple times and ive enjoyed it no problems the five guys at the chandler mall was a good experience but this location left a bad taste in my mouth  literally i wish i could give this  starsthe guy at the register actually looked like a kid must have been a new guy he was slow he repeatedly asked me to repeat my order and he got my change wrong which i just ignored since it was like  cents i guess it doesnt take much to hire here he even had his hat on backwardsmy burger came out half raw and my fries came out undercooked and it wasnt even busy in fact there was like  people there i was really disappointed this wasnt like the five guys i had gone to before it was also fairly messy around the dining area  it was pretty bad even for a fast food restaurant im not coming back to this location hopefully i can still go to other five guys locations when im really hungry just with really low expectations|went there for ayce dinner last night our server seemed a bit grumpy and irritated after asking about some items on the menu but nevertheless we stayed and ordered we remembered our first experience being good and the sushi flavor and portions were great after i got home i started experiencing some stomach pains my stomach got very upset and i started vomiting this went on all night to the point i had to call in sick to work im guessing it was the ikura nigiri i had ordered since my bf did not eat it and he was fine i did not eat or drink anything other than water after we dined there so it was definitely the ikura gone bad sad to say we thought we found a decent ayce sushi place but we will not be returning back to umiya it is|thought i would stop in

happens to be one of my favorites but today it was lack luster served barely warm and looked like it had been waiting on the service line for awhile  then to top it off why would you used a iceberg

suspected my dessert was going to be much longer than  minutes  the waitress apologized and stated that the desserts are made from scratch  we knew that thats why we went a  minute wait to be seated   minutes for the first desserts another  and another  minutes to be served or not is totally unacceptable  our total time there was   hours on a work night  no one else appeared to be waiting more than

as i am if youre looking for authentic pho look elsewhere they use a tepid thin flavorless vegetarian broth for the base of their pho their fried chicken app was lower quality than fast food service was poor as well even after we reminded them that we didnt get our soup and salad before the main entree they still brought it out with the main dish the waitress seemed put off by my questions about the food before i ordered not knowledgable and proud of what they make the assistant food runners slammed dishes down in front of us hastily and practically ran away which was odd because they werent particularly busy and is it just me or does the name of this place sound racist|no stars is more like it run people run if they treat adults the way they do i can only imagine how they treat your kids

restaurant stay open much longer  i dont think i need to write any further  please scroll down and take the time to read patricias responses to the reviews left by the people unfortunate enough to

figured id call just in case a woman answers the phone who is actually the owner i recognized her voice from my prior visits and i proceeded to ask if we would be able to use both of our vouchers i advised her that we could come in  separate parties of  if that would make it easier to redeem she began to argue with me and proceeded to ask me if i can read the reason i was calling was because of the fact that i can read very well and wanted to confirm the details of their exclusions if this is how a business treats a potential customer that might be bringing in a party of  to their restaurant

my regular starbucks  argh  i just dont like getting ripped off so  stars|horrible and slow service who cant keep your order straight  food wasnt terrible but wasnt good enough to have me come back

menu even but im not that excited this is pretty basic as far as chinese restaurants go around here either get a combination plate thats like  noodles or enjoy the worthwhile entrees a la carte with relatively pricey sides i also believe they choose to make their sauces as safe and bland as possible hot mustard that isnt hot sauces that would normally use garlic chili onions etc are rather plain

of the worst dining experiences party of  sat down ordered drinks first than appetizers the table side gucomole came and was made the other apps came drinks still sitting at the end of bar had to ask

was charged extra for those as wellwill never be back  appetizers  drinks  without tipboofar better places in vegas than eldorado |the food here was decent however the service was the absolute worst service i have had in ever being in vegas they have more employees than clients and took min to bring out diet coke also the  bartenders made our drinks and they sat on their counter for  min until we had to ask the manager would anyone mind bringing us our drinks that have been melting no exaggeration they have more employees than customers  bartenders made our  drinks and not one could walk the drinks ft to our table what a terrible experienceas for the bill if you get a margarita cadillac style they charge you for a margarita and then they add  for cadillac stlye  thats a definite first overall very over priced food is decent but for the lack of service and the prices this place is kind of a joke it explains why theres more servers that dont really serve than there was

place one star because their billingfinancial practices are horrible when i signed up i was promised they wouldnt retain my card number i had used debit and that i could pay monthly then a month later they pulled money out of my account this led to a three month fiasco where i was trying to get a refund while they were still pulling money out at one point i was told they couldnt pay me back because they didnt have the money were talking about less than  the business doesnt have checks and i had been attending classes so i wasnt entitled to a refund which was completely untrue to make matters worse their turnover of managers is very high with each one sht talking the last like they were the most incompetent person on earth the gym is nice although they have no speed bag because the owner says its too loud  if you can find a way to give them cash you might be okay but i wouldnt recommend giving them access to your financial information|ive eaten here twice the first time the sushi was

grab some from here yesterday got them home and opened it up and what should have been a grainy powder was a rock hard mound i took it back and their answer was they could blend it for me and thats it they admitted that all of the product on the shelf was like that because of the cold weather come on guys its not that cold they should have been willing to take the product back knowing there is a ongoing issue and returned it to their distributor poor customer service on their part and zero empathy ill keep buying my supplements online after that experience|whenever i go to a new walmart new

takes  mins to install and they wanted  to do it and minus the rotation tires because i had done it a few days prior with my tire reps scott really tried pushing a brake flush on me which was over  at first i agreed and got a quote for  plus tax when i got there i told him i just wanted to take the brake flush off and do the other k services minus the two already mentioned from what i can tell they only did the oil change and replaced the engine air filter  how did it go for  plus tax to  with tax i pick up my car and find that they did not top off any of my fluids low on several of them which is part of the k and i see the receipt only says the  things recommending brake flush and tire rotation i wouldnt have minded paying a little more if they actually did the work i asked them todo not

a childfrom there it just got more blunt and cold she asked when the last time i had my eyebrows waxed i told her i honestly didnt recall but that i never go longer than a week  she said she absolutely needed to know i told her again i didnt know but i estimated  or  days  she said this wasnt good enough  she was scolding mei mean i am sorry but i do work i dont always remember silly little waxings meanwhile she kept reiterating that she needes to know because anything under a week was important to know i told her that if i wrote once a week for ten years than no matter what the exact time line it was less than a week so why was she giving me such a hard timei told her she was making me uncomfortable from the get go and if we could please start over  that i really wanted the

told a  minute wait for a nearly empty restaurant hmmm that should have been our first clue okwe are slow learners the hostess said most of the servers were a no show probably because they were not making any money anyway we waited and ate food was ok but would have been better if the food wasnt sitting under a barely working heat lamp forever because the service is awful and i mean awful i did give it an extra star because kids eat free and i love free i do like the atmosphere so i hope another restaurant moves in when this one closes|the service was very bad we waited about ten minute until a waiter finally came to our table we came here for dim sum but the choice was very limited they only have  carts steamed and fried what makes it worse is that the waiter serving the cart wandered around inattentively and chatted with each other we literally had to walk to them to get our food however the food itself is okay i actually like their shrimp shumai also their hong kong style ice tea was authentic if youve never had one definitely try it  ive been to hong kong for more than  times|the guy that runs this place is a real jerk  im visiting my mom here  im from california  my mom is critically ill and in the hospital i ordered some christmas gifts off of amazon prime now and he wont give them to me  he said he needs a power of attorney from my mom  wtf  shes in the hospital and cant even walk  when i protested he kicked me out and called the cops  he said he was going to have me arrested for trespassing  before this happened a resident in the parking lot told me he rips people off and he just raised everyones water rates again  she was so mad and obviously had extreme dislike for him  if i were you and i was thinking about leasing here id think twice  better yet dont waste your thought energy on this place  use it to find a better place youve been warned  lol i dont usually take the time to write these reviews but this guy deserves this one|i was a resident here for three years when i first moved in the staff was great although i did see some get less than favorable treatment the staff seemed to like me from the get go all was great for about a year or so after that the management started to turn over quickly i believe the property owners changed and things went down hill some of the office staff was still friendly but a few of them seemed to get an attitude fast forward to right before i moved out this year the current staff there is mostly apathetic or very short with you when you come in i wouldnt bother unless you need to pick up a package lets talk about the complex itself the area isnt that great the price was okay for where it was but youll constantly see people digging through dumpsters the apartment staff will drive right by someone doing it and not even say anything also forget walking somewhere at night the one time i did that i was lucky i was in a group we ran into some people that looked like they wanted to start something but our numbers were larger so they left us alonethe parking situation is horrible if you have people come and visit you tell them they will be walking barely enough uncovered spots due to people with multiple cars on top of that if you have a space near the mailbox prepare to deal with people parking in it weekly there wasnt a week that went by where i didnt have someone in my space unless theyve been there  hours the office wont do anything for you do not forget to lock your car i had my stuff stolen at least once as well as mail and packages when my mailbox wouldnt close properlythe apartment itself the appliances are old i constantly dealt with the garbage disposal having food come up while i ran the dishwasher maintenance claimed this was because the wires were connected but refused to fix that or replace it maintenance is generally slow as well when i first moved in they left a note after entering and doing work now they dont tell you when theyve come in to fix things neighbors were hit or miss some were really cool others were quite rude before i moved out i noticed people were getting louder and louder throughout the complex more parties were starting to happen and people with motorcycles seemed to race through with friendsat least a few times a year the water andor electricity cuts off in the complex this can be down anywhere from several hours to a whole day its very inconvenient and there is no warning for when it will happen when it does though youll see your neighbors outside complaining on their cell phones or looking around lost i ended up paying for damages because the apartment was not flexible with walkthrough times and dates unless you are willing to take work off during the week to be there with them they refuse to schedule them on weekends honestly im happy to have paid and moved on i liked how close i was to the freeway and neighboring towns tempe and phoenix was a quick drive away i was also near major restaurants as well as cool spots like bookmans or zia records i wish management had stayed the same throughout my time there i feel the current staff is just there to collect a paycheckif you are the kind of person that really doesnt need much in the way of maintenance or service this place is fine for the location and things to do in the area its not bad it would not be my first choice but you may get lucky with your experience there|this hotel is trendy and hip unfortunately nothing was clean and a nice spider was waiting for me on the pillow the evening manager stephanie nicely upgraded us to another room on the th floor  it was yet another dirty room there were several dust bunnies and a cigarette plastic wrapper on the floor its a shame that the location is great but the rooms are not clean id like to give this place another chance  will update this review if i visit again|well i cant rank this place very high since after all this is a small coffee stop place and not a real cafe but for a university coffee cafeteria they have a nice coffee and nice but extremely overpriced cakes if you need a coffee and you ate there go for it if you want to have a relaxing coffee go someplace else|this was by far ny most frustrating experience  at a red robbin i check the reviews of this location versus the other two and there is a reason people dont like this location totally bad experience last nightfirst off when we were seated our waiter screwed up our drink order then took almost  minutes to make the simple change we requested in the first place our burgers were pretty good as always but our french fries were ice cold and ever refill we got was ice cold as well the fries were disgusting all night longour waiter seemed more interested in standing around in our plain sight socializing with coworkers  than seeing if we were ok we were there for almost an hour we seen him  times and once aas to talk our initial order if i was the manager of this red robbin id really try to see why more people prefer the other locations as opposed to theirs and take a serious look at what theyre doing wrong|i havent put a bite of food in my mouth yet but i rated this restaurant one star just because the cashier he took our order literally rolled her eyes the entire time my kids and i gave her our order first and last time i eat here|prices are very high at this starbucks it

called and all i get is voicemail first and last time ill be eating from this establishment|my wife ordered the smoky pepper jack turkey and i got the black angus club to go after a long day of shopping we were really looking forward to trying this newly discovered deli when i turned around after placing our order there was a sign on the wall proclaiming their huge portions cool black angus club there was hardly any meat on my angus club a single bread slice was thicker than the angus serving and there was maybe one slice of bacon shared between the x cut sandwich considering the slice size of the bread directly comparible to frys brand wheat and cost there should have been much more meat the cheese slices were also very thin however there was just the right amount of sauce tomatoes onions and lettuce for the price paid i could order a gargantuan from jimmy johns and have  meals smoky pepper jack turkey my wife took  bites of her sandwich and said she couldnt eat any more of it again not much meat and the taste of the bread was very bland she eventually picked the meat out and left the bread aloneneither one of us ate the mac and cheese side the cheese looked curdled hanging in clumps from the noodles and it just was not appetizing to look at perhaps it is good and thats the way it usually looks i dont think well be giving them another chance but i am kicking myself for not trying their sweet tea after reading these reviews we usually go to jasons across the street or jjs if we dont want to deal with the traffic on bell rd  stars for the place being clean and well designed|they are no longer open i loved this its sad to see they closed down there food was good and not badly priced|no no no do not waste your time or money on this place terrible service for an empty establishment and even worse drinks i ordered patron and got bar tequila like i wouldnt be able to tell the difference  go next door to kona grill|we dont mind sending  for dinner and wine but this with pricey menu salad  soup  over cooked eggplant parmigiana  lamb special sold out and all other lamb dishes  more wine  a glass and long wait for our check we wont be back  |the staff  of them was friendly when i told them i was looking for a bath bomb and some conditioner but when i said i wasnt looking to spend  on a bubble bath one of them told me that thats how much things cost and that i needed to go shop somewhere else and went to talk to some other customers  dont talk to your customers like that  thats a lie because there were  bath bombs right next to us when she was showing us  items|the worst restaurant experience ever everyone was busy with some party in hall items after order were not available suddenly we ordered chicken pizza for kid and only received cheese pizza the kid took a couple of bites when we told this to our waiter who as ever seemed confused then took the pizza he was eating and put some chicken pieces on top and returned the same pizza rather than replacing the pizza we ordered bombay platter for apps and tandoori mushroom on it was uncooked no chutney was served with anything chicken kathi roll was inedible not even once were our water glass were refilled nobody just gave a damn place is way over priced they completely spoilt our evening|ive only been to this location once so maybe my review is not the most accurate but i will briefly mention how i felt when i did go i think michele ks review below really hits the nail on the head i drink plain black coffee so really its kind of hard to screw that up the coffee was okay but the service is what made me say meh the employees dont really seem to want anyone there i dont even think i was greeted when i walked in and i remember standing there with my fiance for a while before someone reluctantly came to the counter for me its very difficult to hand over my money to someone who is less than thrilled to take my order honestly i would much rather go to the starbucks on alma school and elliot and know that the service will be good along with the coffee|warning sunday  pm the restaurant was understaffed there were two waiters and one maybe two cooks i say cooks because the people in the kitchen are not chefs the tom kha was too sour and salty the deep fried catfish was not crispy ample seating room however the wait for the food to arrive took very long they also did not give us a menu while some parties that arrived after us were given menus there were people complaining about the long wait for food to arrive this girl i saw had to walk around the restaurant to get the sauce tray we ordered water when we were seated but the water did not come until i asked for it for the third time and half way through my meal the soups do not come with rice unless it is their lunch specialexcludes weekend if you are from california just wait until you go back to california for some better thai food probably the worst thai restaurant in california is better than this place one star because i feel bad for the inefficient waiters who havent been properly trained and also because i cannot give less stars in conclusion this place should pay its customers to eat here because time is money and you will be spending a lot of time waiting for your foodyou are welcome hope this review saves you time|i got a living social coupon the guy showed and said it would be  dollars because my floor was so soiledit isnt he would even given us the steam clean he then asked for  cash when i said no he said what can you do i said you can pack up your stuff and he out shister in my opinion|i live  minutes away from this place and i waited  hours for a delivery of orange chicken and shrimp chow mein never received my food and was hung up on the second they found out i cancelled my order from grubhub|dont waste your money this place is ridiculously over priced for what you actually get there were three of us two got a drink and it was   we ordered a reuben sandwich there were only three small slices of corned beef on the entire sandwich a reuben is supposed to feature mainly the beef luckily it tasted pretty good but you cant recover from a  sandwich with no drink and stale potato chips that has no meat they also put onions on their reuben which feels like a sin thats just not a reuben which is i guess why its with the paninis but still the french dip had the exact same problem absolutely no meat except it was worse because it had no flavor either i love au jus more than anything ive actually never met an au jus i didnt like but this one lacked any sort of flavor then the chips im not sure if they were house chips or what i cant describe them adequately because they were a mixture of soggy but stale it was weird tldr over priced not enough meat soggystale house chips okay taste|two stars for food but service was great if you look at my pictures im a badass foodtographer so my photos do the food way more justice than it deserves  trust me it looks way better than it actually tastes truffle fries didnt look that great but the truffle smell permeated in the air so i still had high hopesworse truffle fries ive ever had not that it was disgusting just not very good at all definitely wouldnt recommend although im not going to lie everybody thought it ended up being the best part of the meal the dillinger takes  minutes to cook so be sure to order as soon as you know you want it ours actually took longer than  minutes but okay i honestly do not understand what the hype is about i love deep dish pizza but this was like eating a dense piece of bread with all the toppings my friends compared it to eating a week old baguette or wheat thins except thick it was just really dry dense and hard to eat i literally only took two bites out of my pizza and my boyfriend forced himself to finish one whole slice we were all super hungry but i just couldnt i usually never try to get food taken off the bill no matter how bad it is but my boyfriend doesnt like to pay for food that he has to try and force himself to eat the manager came by and asked us what was wrong with it and it was so bad that we were at a loss for words to even try to explain i felt super awkward because i didnt  want to seem like an asshole but it was really bad the manager did take the dillinger off for us though so thats a plus we also ordered the st anthonys but substituted the sausage for chicken and added an egg for an uncharge the chicken was so dry it was legit dehydrated chicken my friends said that it was just like the chicken they buy for their cats the californian was okay to me my friend who ordered it thought that it was super greasy i thought it was definitely better than the other two which still isnt saying a lotmy friend ordered the spumoni  which i thought was okay she said this was the first time she has not enjoyed spumoni because it tasted weird i think spumoni always tastes kind of weird though so i wouldnt know the mud pies were okay to me as well everybody else said it tasted frost bitten but i only took a small bite so again i wouldnt know definitely not worth  a slice thoughlong story short we wouldnt ever return here for their food although our server and the manager was great we all would have rather had some pizza hut or tostinos|went to lunch here last weekend i saw the high reviews and was expecting great food and service the food was okay not bad we sat at the bar ordered  cocktails and the bartender didnt know how to make them we saw her reading the menu to see what was in them we were kinda disappointed|i went with my fiancs family on a tuesday night  the atmosphere was great and our waitress was wonderful  she checked back on us several times throughout the time and when our party showed up in waves she was on top of getting us new drink orders and making sure that we had enough water  props to the bar staff  the employee clearing away our glasses was also great  we actually had an accident where a member of our party dropped a glass of beer and the staff cleaned it up immediately and without even asking handed him a new glass  drinks are tasty and reasonably priced  the bar staff get  stars and generous tipsthe reason why im giving two stars total is to express my disappointment in the performers  i sent up three requests along with tips in increments of  none of which were fulfilled  i feel very gouged in terms of tipping and i wonder if there could be an improvement in the tipping system  i was originally very excited about this place and had requests lined up in my head  the concept of low key is great  the performers are talented and have great humor but as they pulled up my requests on stage they scoffed and refused to play them  if i had not tipped i would completely understand their inclination to not fulfill my request but i feel like  is worth three minutes of music  i am of the belief that the concept of tipping should be based on services provided and my satisfaction of the services  this is not how low key manages its tipping system  id be a much happier customer if tips werent expected per request and there was a tip jar that i could take advantage of before i leave the bar  that way i could tip accordingly based on my experience and satisfaction| am we ordered two ceiling fans and a remote on amazon thinking we would take advantage of their new amazon home services group our experience was horrible outside of amazons normal amazing delivery speed the day of the installation we received a window of between am and pm kyle from im gonna fix it called and said they were wrapping up with another client and would be there around pm a gentleman named chris showed up at pm and started to work on installing our fans he pulls me aside before he is done and says we can bill your second fan through amazon or if you can pay cash we will do it for  instead amazon charges us a  service fee so we can offer a cash discountwe are so far behind schedule my wife has time to stop and grab the money on the way home from work right before he leaves he comes back and says hey i dont have a screwdriver to put the batteries in the remote he then leaves without testing it so we had no idea if it would work needless to say the remote wont sync with the system he installed so i call them up and ask them to fix it or remove the unit so we can send it backchris comes out again this time he doesnt have a ladder even though he needed one the first time so we let him use ours what kind of a service comes without a screwdriver or a ladder tests the unit then tells me because the unit is defective we have to bill you  for the hour i was here but not to worry amazon will most likely cover the error because the unit was defective so now they want amazon to pay us back for their mistakehis office calls to bill us and i ask them why are we paying you to remove something that you didnt test on installation if the tech actually tested the unit and didnt just leave then we wouldnt be having a second service call she says ok ill call the owner and ask what we can doless than five minutes later chris shows back up at my house asking me whats the problem and that it was ok to bill us because we let him leave without testing it its not only extremely unprofessional to send a service tech back to your front door not to mention the same one that didnt test the unit to try and argue on behalf of the company it borders on intimidation i wouldnt agree that it was our fault that he didnt test the product he installed and i asked him to leave the then promptly charged us the  for the hour  i will never be using amazons home services again ill stick with hiring my rosie on the house certified contractorspm i added this in response to the owners commenti can tell you for us the service was nothing like  satisfied it doesnt do me any good to yell at a technician coming to my house for being  hours late it does let me know that maybe the company i am working with isnt  reliable it doesnt do me any good when i tell the tech that i have a screwdriver available to put that batteries in and he says its fine and goes home it wouldnt have done me any good this morning to send the man away because he showed up without a ladder when i had one he could use it definitely didnt do any good to ask your company to make the service call right because then i had a tech show back up at my house to blame me for his inability to put in batteries and properly test something he installedthe good news is there are companies out there that go above and beyond to make things right amazon refunded us your service fee of  and for the remote within the hour when we emailed them personally i was shocked that they would cover a fee that should have never been charged it wasnt amazons fault we picked the wrong company off of the list to have come to our home none of that mattered to amazon they made it right and did it quickly securing our continued business with them for a very long timeas for offering to put in the new remote for free well i think you can see how we might not think of that as a plus the last one cost us part of the initial  fan installation and an additional  due to reasons listed abovei appreciate the quick response to my review but fixing the issue when i called and spoke to your company would have been better instead i talked to someone on the phone that said she would talk with the owner had a technician show back up at my house to argue the point which is not great service or professional and then got a call three minutes later to pay because you felt it was due regardlessagain i cant say enough good things about amazon for erasing most of what turned out to be a horrible experiencepm finally made it back in my bedroom tried to turn on the fan to take a nap and it doesnt even turn on manually now after a little investigation it seems the tech wired the fan to a different wall switch for the light and the fan which he didnt do before we are hiring another company to check the work|giving one star for the simple fact i cant give zero both times i went to check my bag i received the worst customer service of my life they charge you for absolutely everything they claim to have the cheapest prices but after they charge for checked bags carry ons and your boarding passes youve spent just as much as you would with a better airline if not more i will never ever fly with spirit again|wow  just terrible  i was here with my family and it was beyond bad  first of all the owners arent mexican and the total lack of authenticity can be tasted in the food  the salsa is thick and goopy  the main course literally taste like what i would prepare at home by going to the mexican section of bashas and throwing foods together  im a white guy who cant cook  i so love mexican food and this was a big disappointment  we have recently been going to mucha lucha taco shop with unbelievable food  the owners and everyone who works there are mexican and half the clientele are mexican  now that is good mexican food  this is not that  i will never be back  ill stick with mucha lucha carolinas and los dos molinos|placed an order online because it said it was open when i got there the place is closed i tried calling before hand as well|it was freezing in this restaurant on a cold day i guess theyre overpriced and too cheap to turn on their heater i ordered the red velvet pancakes it came with  i couldnt finish them and i split them with my bf i wish it came with some egg whites and turkey bacon on the side but basically u get  no matter what and bacon and eggs are  more pricey my bf ordered the corn beef with eggs and for  it was a tiny portion this could of been better due to how the menu and portions are set up it must be ran by some greedy people who dont care much for return customers|mooyah is trying to be five guys but fails miserably  its not even hardees at besti ordered the same type of burger i normally get at five guys and then i sat down to wait and wait and wait the place was crowded but it still took them a good ten minutes and change to get me a burger and friesthe burgertobun ratio was weak  the meat was gray and lifeless tasteless  the condiments were skimpy  a single leaf of lettuce a few pieces of thinly shaved onion a ricepaper thin slice of cheese  it did not a burger makethe fries were even worse  they were crusty and hard  they tasted okay but they were clearly overcooked and then left under a warmer far too longfor the  and change the meal cost me i expected a helluva lot more  culvers hardees five guys and a dozen other places all do a better burgerhow this place opened two locations is beyond me|will not return employees were lazy and praised poor sanitation and hygiene practices this place is empty for a reason|maybe its the holidays but service was sooooo slow horrible id understand if it was packed but they were just understaffed plenty of open tables they would have been better off closing than providing a bad experience|food was good but the service was soso and the music was so loud we couldnt hear ourselves think let alone talk to each other  we asked them to turn the music down a little but they refused|i dont normally even make commentsbut this place needs work i went there today because i got a gift card and figured id enjoy some chipotle for lunch as i often do i noticed this one was really close to my apartment less than a mile i asked for a chicken burrito to go and when i got home which only takes about  minutes my burrito was cold normally the chickenbeans and rice are hot and the only thing cold is the cheese and sour cream the chicken tasted burnt and as if it had been sitting out all day also the young lady who made my burrito although very nice ripped it on both ends and said be careful its ripped on both sides without offering to rewrap it or make a new one i got home and put it in a bowl because it just fell apart i might give this place one more chance because its so close to my apartment but i sure hope this was a one time deal|this the third time ive been here and theyve run out of coffee      i qould come more often if i could bring a starbucks or something with methe swrver was very good however the food comes out for each oerson at different times   im done before my granddaughter gets her food  and we all know never feed a kid first  that way they can complain and be unhappytried this place  times  never again|i walked in at  and sat down waited to be served for  minutes and still wasnt being served i got up and left disappointed i guess id stick with other places with good service|this was my worst experience ever with a nail salon this has been my second time coming here and im very unhappy first off the prices are way too high i purchased a fill at  which is originally  at other nail salons my nails are unsymmetrical uneven and not smooth at all also i was cut twice and bled this place is by far the worst experience i have ever had and i will not be coming back|love the store but check out is confusing there are no lights to indicate which cashiers are open after waiting in line to be told to go to another line is not pleasant this has happened to me several times please put up some lights i will obey|the sushi is mostly very good we enjoyed the yellowtail amigo roll monkey brains cucumber salad spicy edamame and teriyaki skip the az roll it is not that interesting or tasty the short ribs were fatty not tender aka gross  the hostess stand and seating is a messdisorganized and not experienced enough to handle the customers  this i my second time here and once again there was a problem with being seated my husband called ahead and made a reservation when we arrived they said they didnt take reservations  the waitress was sweet but in the weeds i like the waitress and i like this place im just not sure it will make it unless it gets organized fast|i honestly dont know what they are trying to do here it appears that they are trying to make the transition from turf and make it into an upscale bar and im not sure it works its basically a nice bar with bar food fare|i really wanted to like this place seeing all the  stars i was sure i was going to enjoy this eatery alas it was not to be i ordered the arepa veggie empanada elote loco burrito yuca fries and drinks of course the arepa was stuffed with chicken cheese and some ketchup tasting like sauce the smell of the chicken just bothered me idk might be the cheesesauce combo did not eat the veggie empanada was well i would not order again the shell was tasty but the same weird cheese saturated in cheese and bits of veggies too greasy for my taste now the burrito was okish too salty low quality in my opinion  of all of us there prefer chipotle now comes the elote loco ugh corn tasted old dressed up with tons of mayo cheese chile to mask it i feel the yuca fries were nice pretty yummy the drinks and yuca fries where why they got two stars if not  thats the way meow sees it|my run tips was extremely salty i could not even eat it i loved seasoned food but this tastes like someone accidentally poured the whole bottle my husband ordered fried catfish and it was pretty good all tho i dont eat seafood|this was the worst meal of the year for me every time i visit kabuto i spend at least  and i leave satisfied and i cant wait to go back to have more of that delicious fish totally different story here we went there tonight me and two friends and we are completely dissatisfied with the food we will never go back the fish wasnt very good some of it even tasted not the freshest everything was painfully very bland and scarce the dessert they brought was some chestnut and red bean cookies cut in half my friend told me that she was positive that they were store bought because they tasted exactly the same as the one she buys at the korean market for few bucks for a big bag i called the waitress and she confirmed very apologetic that they were in fact bought at greenland down the street what a disgrace part of a  a piece dinner very disappointing and crazy expensive do yourself a favor skip it and go to kabuto instead|there were no employees in this store there were no customers either i felt like i was in a bad dream like my world had turned upside down and hit me from all sides i cant imagine living herewho can this place is a special kind of dismal the kind that ensnares you and keeps you there while you cant help but to scream and flail your body but i didnt do either of those things because the order and stability of this dimension was too perfect too pristine i felt overwhelmed yet in a dark miasma of pecans and skull candles and queen beds and fake alcohol the whole place was fake i felt fake the books did not have words i did not have words i was empty a husk strolling through a wasteland of furnitureas i tried to leave i felt myself being pulled back a white noise overcame me as i walked further and further away from the doors and i couldnt hear myself think my head was clouded and spinning what was arhaus and what did it meanneedless to say i will not be coming back here|i am very disappointed in the follow through and nonexistent sense of urgency as it relates to my experience with united kitchen i toured the kitchen in october  and ultimately leased a small commissary space which i believed was needed for a new business i was starting i quickly learned learned from maricopa county that under the permit i was operating with a commissary space was not yet necessary long story short united kitchen debited my account for over  dollars for the month of november  for space that was not used and after multiple attempts to collect a refund here i sit on  without any of that money the kitchen coordinator randi has maintained only spotty communication at best and has ultimately failed to cooperate in returning the money buyer beware they will automatically debit your account for any monthly agreement you enter into and getting the money back should you not use the space is next to impossible small claims courthere we come|we made a reservation by phone for a table for  people at  pm  upon arrival the host stated that they had no record of it  we had to wait for about  minutes while staff rearranged tables to seat our party  when our drink order was taken everyone received their drinks except me  i had ordered coffee and it didnt arrive for more than  minutes  later i ordered a refill after dinner and it didnt arrive for another  minutes and this time it was cold  apparently they order each cup from aok coffee at least  feet away from the restaurant  while the food is excellent the coffee system is beyond rediculous  i wont be back|dont order the queso fundido its straight up cream cheese and if your lucky a crumb of artichoke atmosphere is cool live music was worth the bill|very slow service for a fast food place inadequate food supply bibingka was done before  and they wont cook anymore barbecue grill was too charred and they are not cleaning as often to have the barbecue cook properly needs better kitchen management|horrible experience st time for the grooming services  made an appointment last week for a dog grooming right before christmas  got there and the groomer would not accept without rabies papers  the girl that made the appointment did not mention this and the groomer would not make any exceptions  its the day before christmas eve  groomer said she is trying to get the people setting the appointment to mention the requirement  will not be back for the grooming services or to the store ever again  so disappointed|poor management planning i go in for gift cards for my coworkers and they are sold out|horrible service  wont let you play but sells you a beer to stand around and do nothing while all ganges are of before closing|dumb dumb dumb as rocks here ordered a combo and it ended up in  different bags separate with another meal wasnt spicy like ordered either then tried to order a single item off the kids menu which i know they can do but they insisted that item didnt exist as a meal or item and im staring right at it ordered a side didnt get that in my bag either also ordered a drink and they neglected to tell me they removed it from the order but we still ended up with a kids meal bag i have no idea we even said wed wait and we did wait a few minutes im fine with that but dont tell me you dont have items i can see  convince me to get something else and then not even give it to me properly|this place changed from paradise bakery to a panera bread company i didnt frequent paradise often but had been enough times to know it was solid in the things i ordered my wife and i both felt incredibly underwhelmed with the food we got for lunch the mediterranean vegetable sandwich consisted of tomatoes lettuce cucumbers with a couple of crumbles of feta the tomato soup is not close to what paradise had and isnt a worthy substitute the garden vegetable soup was not tasty and neither was the fontega chicken panini skip this place not worth the trip|i will not be back unless someone tells me that they have worked out the growing pains and improve how to make their food  i was completely lost when i walked in the door we had to stop and figure out where the line started there were too many tables and they were too close together we saw a woman with three young children and she was trying to get a high chair she had to maneuver through the chars and i felt so bad that i had to help her the flow of the room is terrible plus on the table it said as a courtesy to our patrons please order your food before reserving a seat didnt see it until we were leaving because we were stressed out the moment we walked in  most of the staff was not helpful or nice we each were asked by two people at the end of the line what kind of sandwich did we order i said turkey and she said they had several kinds of turkey  but not nicely my motherinlaw wanted to take her sandwich i asked the woman sweeping where i can get a to go box she stopped and stared at me for a few seconds like how dare i bother her she said how many then walked away on her way back she dropped the box picked it up and gave it back to me we didnt take the left over sandwich  dont get me started about the food i will keep it short two of us ordered the ca turkey and the bread was cold and soggy the turkey was also ice cold the soup was cold  the beverage and plastic wear area was a mess some of the beverage containers were empty there were ice mounds in the fountain drink area there were hardly and forks cup lids and lemons all in all it was very disappointing i hope they read their bad reviews i dont think i would have come if i read the reviews|i know i raved about this place before but that was when i lived in an apartment building with a crackhead and we shared the same vents long story short this guy is more supreme court justice antonin scalia than michelangelo or davinci the first haircut that got me yelping was good butremember i was king of all bad haircuts at the time so i really had no sense of style back then month after month it all went downhill as the cuts got shorter and shorter blander  boringer at first i thought he didnt like me but then i saw another young dude get another quick tooshortoutthedoor cut like mine so i realized its just how he sees young mens hair the dude just got old  complacent  needs to retire or just cut hair in a mortuary this place represents the old world  ignorance corruption favoritism etc do yourself a favor  go a stones throw away in lower lawrenceville to mister grooming  goods to get treated like a king  get an awesome cut for just a few dollars more than this doa placetrust me youll be glad you did|the customer service and pharmacy are terrible at this location  i was not helped at all and was basically ushered out of the store  will be keeping my money at aldis from now on|my significant other and i went last year for our anniversary and it was amazing truly service food everything as it is a couple of days before christmas eve and we have found ourselves with no plans i thought we would dine out somewhere nice we both have worked in the service industry so we are aware that not a lot of places are open anyways girasole came to mind because it had left such a good impression on us i called just to simply see if they were open on christmas eve a man answered the phone and when i asked if they would be open his response was no we are a very very holy family holy holy family then hangs up on me needless to say we will never dine at girasole again so extremely rude cannot justify giving money to someone who runs their business in that manner|greyhound is ripping its customers off with their gift ticket fee why should anyone have to pay extra when paying for a relatives ticket|very bad service spoiled the entire evening i will definitely not visit this place ever again|uncle role weird claire not on point not the best performance but a holiday tradition acceptable|this chuck e cheese had the rudest manager i have ever encountered i completely understand in forcing rules but he got super rude and escalated the concern of us wanting to bring in decent adult food while the kids played|i do not give bad reviews often but this one is one of them unforutnately  my husband is from the west coast and he is picky about his chinese food  he thought he found a good place once on his lunch break and wanted me to try it for dinner so we went  it was aweful  how can you mess up wonton soup and vegetable spring rolls  the sesame chicken was terrible  the shrimp with garlic sauce just ok  and the waiter was mia after we got our foodwe wanted to get some extra white rice at least and then our check at the end took forever it was bad  we also returned that wonton soup back to the kitchen since it was so bad  lastly i did not think a tip was deserved so i made that knownand the owner was pissed off and made sure to tell my husband about it but honestly i do not care  you need to do better chinese food in charlotte officially has a bad name|very disappointed to bring my children to the new facility in south end and find it not kid friendly at all  there we no prerigged walls like the monroe rd location and the staff did not care one bit or try to accommodatebut they sure took our  for  kids to boulder for less than an hour as much as we enjoy the original location if you are a beginner or have kids do not go to the new location unless you want to be talked down to by a very pretentious staff|their hanger steak was served to me nearly cold shepherds pie isnt real they use ground beef making it a cottage pietheir desserts are expensive for the size you get and quality the brunches are a bit better which merits two stars they have a large selection of omelettes which are rather surprisingly generously filled|the laundry room is always in deplorable conditions no one cleans up after themselves even though theres a garbage can  feet away|this costco at th and thomas rd is par for the course a good value for certain quality items or bulk purchases  no criticism herethe pharmacy earns the poor review  the staff is professional and receptive and they save the review from a one star to two stars  the pharmacists earn a onestarreview  on two different occasions and by two different pharmacists i have confronted censorious and disapproving comments on medications prescribed to me by my doctor    on one incident one of the pharmacist  had the audacity to tell me that i should not be on my medication  their approach is haughty and condescending  costcos pricing and quality are very competitive even for some pharmaceutical items but that should not entitle costcos pharmacists being specific to this store to be principled bordering on moralistic|really bad experience today i ordered this chocolate coated strawberries  count and i end up getting this  tiny strawberries and  bigger strawberries costing me   each they never displayed the strawberries upon delivery and i feel cheated and frustrated|i was threatened by the delivery driver after he messed up my delivery address this is after i talked to him i got no where which the corporate office also|this bar has changed a lot in many ways as much as they try to remodel and paint the place still smells like a drain i used to go there all the time to see all my friends but as one night as i entered and was trying to put some money in the jukebox but the bill was too worn i was asked to leave not even  min my witnesses can say i was sober i just arrived i was a loyal patron for years for all that i care that place can burn down to hell and i will not miss it a bit maybe my friends will gather in ina place other than that shit hole its a dive bar and not in a good way|the worst front office ever  after surgery i bought glasses from them the glasses i got were not what i ordered they offered to take them back for a full refund but i have been waiting  weeks  they said a week or two but maybe as long as  weeks  because they are such a  large company now after  weeks they said maybe they could credit my credit card because a check will take some time they just want to keep my money   weeks and no refund|after spending over  to get my lawn mowers

could redeem themselves and the actual vet didnt seem to want to hear it they refused to give me a refund on the blood test not great business practices and they didnt even seem to care about

be working at a used car lot in the boondocks  run for the hills  i honestly believe we were racially profiled and gender profiled  they dont respect customers who just want the bottom line  they want to play patty cake and pretend it is negotiations  it is plastered all over their wall literally painted that they respect their customers  i guess if you see and read something everyday you actually believe you are demonstrating those values  sooo not true  find another dealership where they respect the intelligence of women and othersoh yeah  they tried to keep us at the dealership by pretending that we had taken the keys to the test drive vehiclehilarious  only thing i can say is that ruben in service is very committed to customer service  he has gone above and beyond to help my daughter  maybe he can teach the guys in the front about ethics|since the move and new staff a couple years ago service and atmosphere has been greatwell it looks like were back to the same old song and dance with service last two times in there the staff have been rude and unsympathetic or unwilling to even smile another example of people who hate their jobs and probably their lives and we need to count on them to service our cars pathetic bree perhaps a job that doesnt deal with customers would suit you better|horrible place dirty and the male techs look like they could care less about nails dont they realize they work for tips  ive seen them dilute nail polish with polish remover and that makes the finish very dull instead of shiny i kept hoping they would improve since i work nearby and its

was given a temporary disabled placard the walking boot cast she has to wear  makes it incredibly difficult for her to walk or stand for long periods of time i made sure to call a week prior to buying my tickets to ask the ticket agent if it would be possible to sit down on a bench until they started letting people into the theater also that if once they started letting people in if we would be able to go in as quickly as possible since my girlfriend wouldnt be able to stand for a long without being in a tremendous amount of pain the agent was very pleasant and informed me that doing so wouldnt be an issue  so after talking to the agent i went and purchased our tickets almost two weeks prior to the actual showing the night of the showing we got to the theater at pm for a  pm movie we went straight to the theater and i asked to speak to a manager to explain the situation  when he came out and i let him know that my girlfriends foot was broken and showed him the disabled placard he looked at her foot for awhile with a smirk on his face deciding whether or not her disability was good enough for him  now just because someone is not in a wheelchair does not mean they are not disabled  this was complete discrimination and i hope that in the future anyone who is disabled and does not look it does not ask for assistance from this manager  after about a minute pause he said yeah thats fine i guess and walked away without saying anything else   we had no idea what we were supposed to do and just stood there for a good couple of minutes until he started flagging us down from the eating area by the concession stands  we walked over to him where he was standing by a table with with a family of  who were all sitting down enjoying theyre food  he then proceeded to say excuse me but this lady cannot stand because of her broken foot pointing down to my girlfriends foot they said it wasnt a problem and the father stood up and gave us his seat  he then said to us out loud dont forget to thank these people for giving up one of their seats  this put us in a horrible and incredibly awkward situation  we did not ask the manager for a chair  let alone taking one from a family who was in the middle of their meal we then are sitting there while while the father of that family is standing their having to eat his dinner making us feel like jerks for taking his chair when we didnt ask for it in the first place  i go to gvr maybe  times a week and see movies at this theater at least once a month  i will never be back to this theater unless   they are lucky my girlfriend didnt sue for discrimination|it was hard even giving this place one star all i can say is if you ever step foot into this bank stay away from mildred delozier she is the nastiest banker i

definitely closing this account and making sure nobody i know ever steps foot into a wells fargo branch again my first issue was an expected wire transfer showing up in my account and disappearing the next day then my temporary card not working at the atm after they didnt send my permanent card i had to stay up all night and go into the bank when they opened just to start a new account and get a new temporary card to use which took about  hours mildred from this branch said no sorry that is not true to every single problem i listed to her today i said so are you calling me a liar and she said yes  then when i was waiting in the lobby after asking her to talk to someone else because of how rude she was there was only one male employee in his booth arguing with a female customer saying its the holidays theres nothing i can do to help you so i walked out also if you ever do have the misfortune of walking into the bank be careful on your way out the second sliding door almost closed right on my face today thank god i jumped back visit from hell|never coming here again wasted my time i am going elsewhere so professionals can fix these peoples mess|worse place  i ordered a crispy chicken

two of the specific motorcycles we wanted to experience the drive indian scout lighter weight and lower for shorter women too  now they said they dont have them but will substitute for harleys which we do not want or like they wont refund us and said we have to accept the substitute based on terms and conditions bad bad customer service if this as a good company they would be refunding since they lured us online by stating they did have the indian scouts in stock to rent for that date but then they did a switch a roo deceiving we are two women and wanted a lighter and lower bike that we have not driven before we were repeat customers and now we are notdylan is forcing us to take whats available in comparison in harleyso we are stuck or we will lose  not happy customers shame on you

be very careful of this company there was no problem paying it as soon as i found outthen when you call they are very rude i was told they do not have the staff to contact people who owe on accounts based upon this service and the wait times in their clinics they are very understaffed it is interesting they would rather pay a collection company  of a bill than hire their own staff  hmo for you no care no servicethis is an hmo if you can swing a ppo do it much better care|at my last visit to this place i had the  two fish tacos with fries and a drink and chili cheese nachosthe nachos were decent they were hot cheesy and had a good chili flavor to them not a bad deal for only  the left over chilicheese sauce went well with my fries nothing special but it worked the fries i had been given were pretty delicious they were salted crispy and hotthe fish tacos come warm wrapped in foil upon opening the foil there is a single slice of lime before full uncovering the taco which i thought was pretty neat however all thoughts of ingenuity vanished when i learned that the limes i had been given were dry and incapable of producing any significant amount of lime juice what so ever upon opening the rest of the foil wrapper what i was greeted with was a decent sized fish taco on a flour tortilla unfortunately the fish taco was void of any tacolike flavor no flavor of fish cabbage nor salsa was present however any condiment i added on the taco whether it was the few drops of lime juice i was able to produce or hot sauce would become the flavor of the tacoa typical del taco experience fast service low quality food i have enjoyed the other items on the menu but i have learned not to expect much from a fast food joint this was one of my less enjoyable visits|i have been going to this dentist for about  years i love the few people that they have had since almost the beginning of me going there theres constantly new doctors i see thats not that big of a deal because they have all been fairly nice but they dont always seem to know much about my mouth which kind of sucks today was the first time that i have seen the only male doctor there dr alemi he surprised me with a few things that i was unaware of going on inside of my mouth instead of trying to talk to me softly about it he instead says what are you going to do about it in a very rude tone i couldnt understand why he was so rude to me from the beginning while i was having my teeth cleaned i could hear him not being so nice to others also he seemed like he didnt want to be there nor do his job he wasnt really listening to anyone it seemed he also interrupted me multiple times still with his rude tone its unfortunate after  years of going here that i wont ever go back again because of him its right by my house and the women at the front desk that have been there for years have always been nothing but sweet to me the world needs less people like him he thinks so highly of himself and thinks that hes doing people a favor just by looking at our teethit sucks that he is this way and i hope for his sake that he changes i wouldnt want another person to feel the way that i did and rushing out to your car just to cry because of him|awesome  am on a weekday and someone decided to reset the fuel pump computers  maybe have night shift do this  cars sitting here and stacking up|the service at this pizza hut is horrible  i live two blocks away spelled the name of my street several times and they said i was out of their delivery area and she didnt even know where i lived the manager has no comprehension of customer service their online ordering has more glitches than a new windows launch  eighteen dollars it wasnt worth eighteen cents  the pizza dough was old so it was soggy and when i asked zach the manager of it was old he said yes two days old i thought pan dough was fresh made every day  well so if you like pizza dont get it from here|i always get bad vibes about this place each time i go in must be about my skin color because its certainly not about my character because no one knows me|dont go its a trapone of my molar had a little chipping on the edge which didnt cause any pain or discomfort but the dentist recommended me to have a filling however what he did was not filling the chipped area but drilling a big hole through the middle of the chewing surface and filling that hole with what he suggested good material since the drilling is so deep part of the nerve is damaged which gives me a constant pain that i cant eat with my damaged tooth i revisited the office twice after the filling was performed and reported the ache the dentist thought it is the contour of the filling causing the pain and therefore adjusted the contour during these two visits however the ache became even worse after his adjustments during my last visit i asked him why you drilled a hole in the area where there is no chipping at all his answer was i dont know and when i asked him why i have this ache he said you are a special patient his answers are so arrogant and reckless that i started to feel i have been played the people there only want money they would treat you just like cows to milk and nothing else its hard to imagine how many patients have been treated like me and the only reason they dont know they are also victims is because they are not special|we used to love to come to this restaurant and came often but recently had a terrible experience with the owner anita after a long back and forth with a number of customer service gaffes anita told us that her motto is the customer is always wrong im not sure she knows which industry shes in and we will not be returning|i went here with my mom a few days ago we came in i ordered some ribs with mac and cheese and corn on cob the fork i received wasnt clean so me and mom had to ask for plastic forks and the waitress i had want too good she assisted my mom with finding something on the menu and while she was holding it up she was kinda smacking my face with it i even looked her to kind of give her the look like ummm im right here but she looked at me and continued to like have the menu in my face she didnt even apologize for it i thought that was kind of rude the ribs were amazing they were the only thing that was good the cornbread was cold  mac and cheese tasted like kraft mac n cheese i can cook in microwave by myself in mins  i would come back here only for the ribs definitely not for the service i got and especially not for the cold cornbread tasted like frozen cornbread that wasnt reheated all the way  i received|bleh girl totally ignored my request not to file and basically filed the gel off of my nails with the manager watching this technique does anyone know where kathy went|so my first visit was awesome and i thought id try it out again terrible the girl who did my fill nicked me on  yes three fingers while filing to shape my nailsthats  bloody cuticles that i now hope wont get infected not to mention my manicure now looks horrible the gel is very uneven and im super disappointed wont be back for another try |ordered takeout no big deal except that they added over  worth of charges to my card for absolutely no reason couldnt give an explanation and gave me the runaround before finally settling never again mediocre sorta chinese food isnt worth   and terrible customer service unless tiny shriveled chicken and dry tastless rice is your thing  go elsewhere|good doctors but horrible answering service and staff  answering service gave us two choices of times and we chose the one that gave us an md not a np  we verified the doctors name and still was entered into the other time  so we arrived late on time for the appointment that we accepted early actually and were told we couldnt be seen  after i pitched a fit one doctor squeezed us in a slot two hours from the original time  we have been with these doctors for over  years  that is what loyalty gets you nothing  get a new service|the female vet is hateful and rude doesnt care at all about your pet she only cares about your money i will not tolerate a rude non caring vet taking care of my dogs shes got a clan of snooty  old women up front too horrible first impression snobs i wish i could give this place  stars|two weeks ago i was here and had the worst food ive ever had at a bar it was so burnt i couldnt even taste the chicken on my chicken wings and my waffle fries were burnt chips now im here looking forward to friend pickles literally came here only for fried pickles and they dont have them instead mini corn dogs the mini corn dogs we bit into them and frozen not even kidding i dont care if were drunk or sober i want my food cooked appropriately this is ridiculous i like food too much for this shit one star for having heat on a cold winter wisconsin day and an outlet for kate to charge her phonethenthe we took the corn dogs back to the bar to get cooked and when we got them a second time they were burnt molly almost broke her tooth so with that said dont get food here even if its free and the bartenders should take some cooking classes|i came to this ups store to drop off two boxes with prepaid shipping labels since the boxes were big and heavy i went into the store and asked if they had a trolley i could use they said no since the boxes were prepaid and not a sale for the store i could not use any of their resources i asked if that included having one of their employees give me a hand with the boxes they couldnt give me a hand nor could they loan me a trolley i brought the boxes in myself literally scooting and rolling them into the store it strikes me as rather rigid and unfriendly to refuse to help a  foot tall woman manage two heavy boxes on her own particularly when there were two employees present and the store was empty i will not be bringing any business to this store in the future|i dont get the reviews short line this am quickly seated promptly served cold decaf in thermos pot wife ordered benny with hard eggs emphasized hard several times as soft turns her stomach arrived soft  no one bothered to check they offer a remake of course so now we get to enjoy going out to watch each other eat  together my steak and eggs ordered medrare comes out blue rare and tough egg yolk is broken potatoes are cooked to death and hard toast and coffee was fine waitress comes back with remade benny wife tells her my steak is rare she asks if i want it remade i put it on the side plate and tell her she can take it to the kitchen to toss it out she seems offended by my attitude cant include my inside voice thoughts hereshe returns a couple of minutes later and tells us the manager comps the bill never saw or heard from the manager never saw her againin my experience theres a lack of standards here or this many mistakes wouldnt have happened in a single visit its an egg place youd think theyd have that part figured outthe manager never bothered to make an appearance perhaps of the view that your best course of action is to buy off the unhappy customers and hope they dont come back you win the lesson here is that if you dine here and your food doesnt live up to the menu complain a bit and youll get to eat sort of for free probably not as bad as this experience but theres lots of at least as good options in the area|this place is horrible i got there and was told  ppl were ahead of me so i sat down and waited a lot of other people arrived and they were taking in people that arrived after me so i asked them whats going on and the guy jerry ibarra said they were all ahead of me so i explained that i was there way before them and was waiting for a straight hour with  kids and my wife and all he said was o well honestly i am not a rude person and everytime i go wether they cut my hair good or bad i leave  tip sorry to say that people like that are trash|went to this place about  weeks ago and the service was friendly and the food was great now i grew up on indian food and i love spicy food i usually eat my food with a lot of spices and have a tolerance to it so the burrito i got was a bit spicy and it was really good okay so yesterday i went back the service was rude and upset that i came in  minutes before close which i apologized aboit as i had not realozed their closing time and i tipped them so i asked for a chicken burrito with salsa like last time  this burrito was so spicy i could not finish it in fact i had to get ranch to calm down my mouth that burrito burned all the way down i ate ghost chili peppers and it did not hurt this bad just sayin|i expected to get flavored ice cream coffee but may have been thinking about somewhere else my daughters liked their blizzards i probably wont visit again the vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup i settled for was okay i would save the calories next time|i am a huge breakfast fan when i see lots of positive reviews for breakfast i have to try them i dont know if we ordered wrong or what but we were not impressed at all my husbands burger was flat out disgusting it was some preformed frozen beeflike product the biscuits were bland and very floury the chicken fried steak was average service was good but nothing outstanding ill be honest it wasnt good enough that we would even bother trying it again|we got there at  pm we were charged  per game pm  pm but the listed price for our time open  pm was  per game when i asked the cashier about this she said i dont know why i just work here this is not excellent customer service and something more|dealt with one sales rep via phoneemail but was handed off to another sales rep upon arrival sales rep knew nothing about the vehicle besides the very obvious test drive started with a straight drive to the gas station because the car was empty sat down to talk details on the deal and made very clear i had my own financing arranged already so only wanted to talk price they take down my info and without my knowledge and certainly without my permission ran a credit checkthey tried to charge  for window tint which clearly had been on the car well before it was traded in it was starting to fade i called the sales rep out on this and he straight up lied claiming they installed itthey also tried to charge a refurbishing fee of  when i asked what that was about he stated it is the cost for the dealership to get the car ready for sale truly ridiculousi will not buy a car from this dealership evermy experience there was just a huge waste of time|welli did love this place  theyve made a poor decision and this onestar rating isnt going to shake their business and me not going there anymore isnt going to hurt their pocketbooks but a craft brewery letting abinbev who insulted craft brewers during last years super bowl buy you out shows a lack of commitment to other craft brewerstheir interview on mouthbysouthwestcom only showed how much more arrogant they are dismissing the feelings of those who dont agree with them by calling it irrationalwell i might as well get more irrational  four peaks can suck the piss out of my dick now  and by piss i mean bud light  and by bud light i mean kiltlifter lime tangerita|used to pick up food for lunch all the time up to a year ago and it was greatordered delivery just a few days ago  sunday afternoon  and it was awful bbq pork slices in a container half full of soggy greasy cabbage and since when does a business refuse to leave a receipt wont be ordering again|i was debating between giving two or three stars with this review i really really really really dislike going to places that are cash only it is  i am normally not carrying cash on me it truly fathoms me that any restaurants are still cash only in this day and age petes is a chain so one would think that they could figure out a pricing model that allows them to start accepting plastic i settled on the two star review because i feel like the employees want you to have the most inconvenient experience as possible if you are going with someone and want to pay separate they will not let you do so its really not that hard to do separate checks i can see not letting customers get crazy with several different orders but two separate orders should be totally doable as for the food it really is very good i always get the chicken tenders and fries the red sauce is amazing i just wish the service was on the same level so it would be more convenient to visit this restaurant|the old lady who works here is a racist bigot my sister went in to look for a specific color and style wig and the lady working replied to all of her questions with why would you want that she then went on to say you do know these wigs start at  and go up from there right i dont know where she got the idea that we can not afford their prices skin color maybe i wouldnt recommend taking your business to wigs amor they only seem to cater to white women as another reviewer stated no wonder wigs amor has low ratings at all of their previous locations as well as this one|maybe it was just an off day for me  i will however try it again|im giving this hospital  star only because you cant give it  while visiting friends in henderson my old dog went downhill he was  years old and had an infection last summer that caused him to lose a lot of weight it was a struggle to keep weight on him and he always looked very thin when he stopped eating i knew it was time to let him go i made an appointment with the closest hospital and whoever answered my call seemed nice the red head at the desk when i got there was entirely different here i am standing at the front desk crying my eyes out while she types in my information answers calls and basically ignores me i asked if we could be put in a room to wait and she said she needed to fill out the form on her computer and charge my credit card first so i stood there for what seemed like an eternity with tears streaming down my face while she dutifully filled out her form eventually she opened a room and left us no blankets or anything so my old dog was forced to lay on the cold hard floor for another  minutes eventually a tech came in another red head and said she would have to take my dog to the back i wasnt about to let my dog go with someone i didnt know in a hospital id never been to before so they could do something to him without me being able to help him i said whatever needed to be done could be done right there in the exam room she left and when she came back she said that would be okay but i would have to leave the room i told her i was a vet tech and have assisted with surgeries and necropsies so there wasnt anything id faint over but no the hospital rules are that i couldnt be present while they worked on my dog i was just about to take my dog and leave but decided for his sake to compromise and step outside but the door would remain open they agreed while outside the door the song that was playing was queens bohemian rhapsody with the lyrics  mama ooh i dont wanna die again i felt i needed to leave and walked in the room just as they finished placing a catheter i hugged my dog and asked him if he wanted to stay so they could help him leave his old body luckily the vet walked in and she was the only nice person i met there i believe her name was dr aybar she immediately noticed there was no blanket for my dog and went to get one she was the only one who seemed to genuinely care about my dog and meits hard enough when you lose a beloved pet but to be surrounded by such uncaring people with that one exception at a time like this is just unthinkable if you care about your pet i urge you to skip this hospital until they can hire better support staff|no accessible computer bars near most gates  very expensive concessionssitrepthese days an airport is more than just an airport ie a hub for arriving  departing flights  they are small selfcontained cities that  ideally  provide all the necessities and amenities for the traveler forced to spend considerable downtime at the airport in between connected flightsits gotten to the point where mccarran is more about itself and what money it can pump into its own coffers rather than considering the comfort and business needs of those travelersthe setupfirst off let me say right here i am not a fan of the slot machines  not because i think they are a waste of time and a waste of money but primarily because every time i come back through mccarran the acreage of slot machines seems to be taking over the airports floor space growing like illkept weeds  it seems the terminal space is diminishing more dense crowds youre having to walk through because those dam slot machines are encroaching over into every spaceaskew priorities  too few amenities for business travelerswhats really disappointing about this turn of events is the fact that the priority is not placed on the business traveler at all too few phone charging stations too few computer stations too few outlets periodthe reality is some of us dont have a choice on how long we are forced to wait at an airport  so we see value in those airports that understand the metrics of those of us who need to keep business connectedratingid love to downgrade this rating to one  star but i am forced to concede that this airport has free wifi at least  so they get another star for thatthe lowdown so it would seem with respect to us  a rather large segment traveling patrons who are the bread  butter of airports like atlanta phoenix and this one  mccarran is one of those airports that has its priorities askew|been ordering there for years but recently disappointed ordered a dozen   of tamales and  were raw after calling x and being on hold the girl tells me come in  bring the tamales  ill exchange them not even a sorry or anything  ive been giving you my business for over yrs and thats what i get poor customer service|casino actually nicer than i thought it would be definately dont feel safe here security standing around having personal conversations with each other and cursing|not a real philly cheesesteakwent there with high expectations because any place that claims to have philly cheesesteak better know how to make a philly cheesesteak  not here  being a native pennsylvanian and growing up on real philly cheesesteaks this was a big disappointment  meat was not cooked to order on the grill instead probably cooked the night before or worse  put in a big pot and then simply reheated on the grill when orders placed  this process allows meat to sit in its own juice making the bread extra soggy  so soggy that you cant pick up the sandwich with your hands  he gives you a fork to eat it  what  the meat had absolutely no flavor very bland and chewy  there is a reason that people stand in line in philly to get a real sandwich and they dont mind the long wait because they know it will be the real deal  pulling meat out of a pot is not acceptable to call yourself a philly cheesesteak  for all those leaving good reviews well i guess if you havent had a real one you just dont know any better|popyou probably need to get on the same page with the guy you had behind the grill on friday afternoon  because my wife asked him if the meat was grilled to order and he said no i noticed him pulling our order out of a pot next to the grill and reheated it on the grill that my friend isnt the real deali stand by all of my reviews in fact i take reviews very seriously and i have the experience needed to leave such reviews on this forum as a former chef and restaurant owner when i say that your meat was tasteless and boiled i meant it i think i have had enough cheesesteaks in my life to know what the real deal is and yours unfortunately wasnt|second trip to this location in  months and they have a horrible staff of rude and unintentive people first visit was almost two hours of waiting for  minutes of interaction before they told me they couldnt help metodays visit another prescheduled appointment at the genius bar has led to waiting for an hour after signing in to only find out the rep actually canceled my appt rather than sign me in  another  min pass and i finally get attention to tell me that the battery replacement program is not active anymore and they need to fix the website where it says it is active until next month no sorry for the mistake or sorry for the wait rather another cold shoulder with no fix to my iphone issues head to another store and save yourself the time|my son had a simple surgery here and the actual treatment was fine it was the billing that is earning this review i was quoted  for sunrises portion of the bill and was told if i paid in full up front i would get a  discount i scraped together the cash and paid up front only to receive a bill for  more i spoke to several people and they all told me that the first quote was just an estimate i told the billing people that wasnt explained to me i was given a quote then baited in to paying in full  i dont understand how the actual price can be almost double the amount of the estimate there was nothing abnormal about the hospital stay and the procedure went exactly as planned in and out in  hours after speaking to a lot of people and being told that i had no recourse but to pay the bill i explained that i didnt have the money on the insurance hsa card just yet but that my employer contribution was coming in a month and could i pay then she told me to pay a few hundred now and when it comes in to pay the rest or as much as i could later one month later i receive a letter from a collection agency stating the account is with them and they will file a judgment against me i have the money on the hsa card but the problem is the card only works to pay for medical expenses and not for collection agencies now i have to come out of pocket the k or else i get a judgment this bait and switch billing scam they have should be illegal and investigated its not right to give someone a pay in full discount only to come back and ask for almost twice as much more money they should have a really good idea how much a  hour stay is going to be based on the procedure being done i understand if complications occur then the bill could go up but that did not happen in this case the estimate should be very close to the actual total and if they offer a pay in full discount it should be considered paid in full they scammed me into paying way more money up front and now are sending me to collections for the rest despite saying i could pay the rest later if you have the unfortunate need to have to take your child here make sure you ask a lot of questions to the billing people and dont pay anything upfront until you are provided a detailed quote that assuming there is no complications will be very close to what the final bill will be dont believe their pay in full discount scam|never go to this hospital i went to desert springs to be monitored while i got through a stomach flu because i was  weeks pregnant and i wanted to make sure my baby was ok they transferred me to sunrise first off they asked me if i had been feeling depressed even though i was there for a stomach flu and then tried to give me antidepressants that cause birth defects they went behind my back and called my doctor saying i needed to be on antidepressants because i had been feeling a tiny bit sad even though i was  weeks pregnant they completely ignored the reason i was there brushing it off as morning sickness i repeat  weeks with a stomach flu and stuck me in a room with seriously ill patients drug addicts and cops also nobody pays attention to you here i sat there for  hours with a half full bottle of saline because nobody noticed my iv wasnt working and i was told i was being transferred here to see an ob who i never saw i repeat never go to this hospital|very

homemade potato chips instead of fries like the menu says out comes with then argued that we were wrong and that is what we ordered strike oneordered the cheese quesadilla which is just an appetizer and a dinner salad the dinner salad is listed at  and they served me a tiny bowl with a half a handful of lettuce two slices of tomato and a slice of cucumber for  bucks it normally is a nice sized plate full salad as ive ordered it many times before again the waitress argued and didnt even know what i ordered of the menu not would she look it up strike twono apology just a waitress that didnt deserve to be in front of people and a cook who didnt care strike threesorry but will never return to this place even after being a long time customer for  years recent price increases along with a rude ill informed waitress was the last straw|i wish i could give it negative nonstarsrun as far away from here as possible and do not put your money hereabout a year ago they started closing atms so there is only  locations in the valley where you can make a depositthe employee turnover is hugethey hire people who have zero skills so all your interactions with them are arduous and aggravatingi have brought to their attention the atm at the maryland parkway location the drive through one it says it can take up to  bills but its often broken and cant even take   i seem to be the only one letting them know there is a problem but they never fix iti had to ride my bike  miles there each way so in the summer i prefer to make my deposits in the mornings for safety as well but the atms would never work  since i didnt have a car having to come back after  am after i was dressed and get sweaty was a huge inconveniencethey simply dont care at all about their customersthe final straw was that the week of december th  i finally have a car now  i drove to the maryland parkway atm at  am of course it was out of order as usualso i sat in the car waiting to make a deposit inside when they open at  amthirty minutes sitting in the carwithout being able to make this deposit i cant turn on my online advertisingthey came out at  am and woo hoo everything is out of servicei mean its how do you not have a handle on your systemsso i put in google maps to find another location which ended up being a corporate office  i walked in and i had my dog with me and the lady behind the glass is gushing over my dog as if i am not attached to the dog in this high squeaky little girl voice which has made me nauseous inside  i dont acknowledge what she said which i know pissed her off by her body language i wasnt rude its not like she asked em a question i ignored i simply didnt participate in her rapture over my dog because it was beyond unprofessionali asked this lady if they take deposits i was neither friendly nor rude  no they dont take deposits but there is an atm next to the office and she is pointing to the rightsurrounding the building is a blue iron fence and nowhere in sight is an atm  there is a sign that says drive up atm with an arrow that points towards the back of the buildingi thought maybe the gates open when a car comes up so i tried that but the gates dont openso i had to reverse park again and walk back in and i asked the lady to please show me where the atm is  she says and i quote oh im not allowed to leave  my thoughts were allowed  you cant step outside and show me where the atm is  this location doesnt even keep money on siteso i ask her again to please explain where the atm is i told her i only see blue iron gates surrounding the building  so woo hoo she breaks her rules and tells another woman she is going to go outside to show meshe steps two feet out of the building and is just pointing in the direction towards absolutely nothing so i tell her i dont understand what she is referring to and ask her to please show me i mean its nuts by this point shes pointing to the airi raised my voice in frustration in doing so and this freak feeble woman claimed to be scared of me so she backed up and said she was not going to help methe problem with this woman is that she has no ability to communicate  in my frustration i called her a name and spat at the ground telling her how useless she iswhen i got in my car and left the driveway of the premises it was then that i saw the atm is on the other side of the giant blue iron fence  if this woman had just said its on the other side of the giant blue fence that would be a sentence that communicates a concrete thoughtfirst of all the atm sign points to the back of the buildingsecond why would any reasonable person think that the atm is on a different property than the banks own propertythird why doesnt this woman just say its on the other side of the fencei wish i could include pictures of their complete incompetencethe atm is in a brick wall with zero signage around it and doesnt look like any other drive through atmbecause of my behavior the bank shut off my card and closed my account and i am so grateful that i was forced to go to a real bank that hires intelligent and professional human beings who know how to be at work and communicate with customersi

that looked and tasted like it had been sitting there all day was amazed they even served it to me i have had better microwavable pizza|tried this place again after a year or so truly one of the worst fast food places in town there is no pride in this place employees look slovenly and unkept it is apparent that employees have no interest in providing any sort of customer service it looked like i was interrupting an employee discussion when i approached the counter after about  seconds one of the employees walked up to the counter and said whats up what can i get for you i can understand being informal with customers but this casual nonprofessional attention doesnt work for meto top it all off the food took a long time to be served and in the long run i learned a lesson this place will never be worth my time again|me and a friend were looking for a place that was nice and not to busy so we seen this bar and decided to stop in well that was a mistake we entered and there was no one in the front so we didnt know if we needed to be seated or if we just go sit down after about ten to fifteen minutes of standing there mind you the workers inside seen us just never acknowledged us we decided to seat ourselves after a while we noticed we were being ignored when servers walked by we would raise our hands and try to get there attention and we would get no response a couple more people then walked in and they were helped this place was rude and ill make sure to never recommend any one to this place really sad the place seemed to have a nice setting|the rudest staff i have ever experienced and not even the manager seems to give a damn the room was disgusting wallpaper ripping off the walks the tile cracked in bathroom and the toilet paper holder hanging off wall i actually asked the manager if we should even be allowed to stay in this room as it seems to be in need of serious work our keys stopped working  times and they couldnt give a damn do not stay here whats sad is almost every review on here is negative and they dont try to change|i had made reservations to stay at the venetian hotel las vegas for the nights of dec   dec    when i got to the hotel to check in sometime after  pm the staff at the venetian said there was no room for me there and they sent me over to the palazzo  the walk over to the palazzo was very hard on me since i am a cancer patient  no one offered any help for me to get to the palazzo  reasonable accommodation should have been made due to this unexpected change  the next day i was so tired from this experience that i stayed in my room until noon  i wish to never go through such an experience again  getting help to go from the venetian to the palazzo would have been great but no such thing was offered  i plan on not staying at the venetian or palazzo again  i passed this information to my sister and brother who frequent the venetian  my brother called the venetian and asked what happened to my  reservation  he was surprised how i was treated  i told my sister because of this experience and that i will never stay at either hotel in the future pws|pathetic got a lap dance and dont walked out without seeing

woke up so sick the next morning messed up my vegas trip i was sick all next day and stuck in this damn hotel for another night waist of a trip money and time no one was helpful never staying here again even the rivera was better to bad its no longer there |used to stay here all the time its been a few years and probably wont stay here again very run down the employees were all friendly except

time around at all checked in around pm no line at all but its a monday so we didnt expect it to be packed for late checkins we are given a room on the th floor that seems to be older and not updated like the last room we stayed in on the th floor we leave to eat and wander and return to our room late and knock out i wake up around am after a few hours of sleep and it is freezing in the room i walk over to the thermostat to find that it is completely blankbrokennot working i cover my kids up with every blanket we brought and it is still very cold its  outside we wake up this morning and my kids are coughing and sneezing just great i need sick kids on christmas which means i will be quarantined from my family because my father is elderly and ill i call for engineering and it takes them over one hour to replace the whole motor and tinker with the unit until he can get it to work very inconvenient then we go to change our clothes to leave and either a nail or a staple in the carpet sticking up cuts my foot under my big toe my son says he stepped on the same sharp thing in the carpet last night and it also went straight into his foot i decide to stop by the front desk to complain this is just unacceptable i speak to jerome or jamal or someone whose name begins with a j that is supposedly a supervisor he was an african american man that was completely useless i told him everything i just wrote about and he very slowly and methodically asks me ok what would you like me to do about it omgyoure asking me you are supposedly a supervisor you tell me i tell him i dont have an answer for that and he apologizes says he will send an email about the carpet and walks off wowunbelievable horrible awful customer service not what i expect at the mb next time well stay elsewhere clearly they dont care about their guests or need our business bad just bad|such a disappointment took a large group  while on a visit to vegas and specifically picked the restaurant based on past positive experiences at french laundry unfortunately the food at bouchon didnt even remotely match up multiple members of our party ordered the steak frites and a few were improperly prepared undercooked by a large margin after sending them back a couple still came back wrong one still undercooked the other turned to a briquette the rest of our meals were mediocre at best the only saving grace of the night was a couple of fantastic bottles of reserve wine with a price tag to match the service was good as was the private room they were able to accommodate us in but unfortunately even the best servers cant make up for poor food|my friend and i stopped by natt spil before the nutcracker on a friday evening it was my first time and my friends second time dining there  when we arrived around  the place was pretty empty save a couple of folks at the bar and another table of people  when we sat down the waitress came over immediately to ask for our drink order my friend ordered her drink but i wasnt quite ready and asked for a minute to check it out we did not a get a minute we did not get two minutes we got fifteen minutes until our waitress came back to check on us  my friend tried to get our servers attention at least four times and each time it was almost as she made a conscious effort to ignore us when she finally came back we were ready to order drinks our appetizer and our food  i ordered my food and my drink and when my friend ordered her food she mentioned her drink again the waitress replied you already ordered that my friend kindly pointed out that she hadnt received it yet to which the waitress barked back that the bartender was busy because there were a lot of people coming in  okay then  when i was finally brought my drink a cider it came in a can which i was unaware of i would have liked a glass to drink it in but our server literally did not come back until after our dinner had arrived and my drink was mostly gone i was really hoping that the food would completely make up for the poor service we had received but sadly i was not impressed we ordered the spicy cheese wontons which were basically giant fried wontons with a teeny tiny bit of not spicy cheese in them and some kind of maybe sriracha sauce i didnt like them at all it came with three and my friend and i both only ate one  very quickly after the appetizer had arrived our food came the table was super cramped i appreciate that the food came quickly but it drives me crazy when the dinner comes within like five minute of the appetizer i choose the brie and apple pizza for my meal this was the best part of the entire experience but it still wasnt that great  the pizza itself was cooked perfectly the crust was excellent  the toppings however were a bit lackluster i was expecting more flavor from a pizza with brie apple shallots and sage it definitely wasnt bad it just needed a little moresomething i would have tossed a bit of salt andor pepper onto it but there werent any shakers at the table  when we left the restaurant was still not full which surprised me because i have always heard nat spill described as one of those tiny places that you have to get to early to get a seat this was definitely not the case and it seemed like they had trouble serving the patrons they did have this restaurant is listed on madisoncoms list of  plates that define madison but honestly it was a pretty big disappointment  i can overlook bad service for really good food i can overlook just okay food if theres really awesome service this place had neither bummer|im sorry that i even considered this place for breakfast total dissapointment discusting greasy and cheap junk food|for years and years i have been going to jade palace we were very regular customers  also it was my to go place with guests from out of town the food was great but it has gone completely downhill this past year or so it had gotten so bad that we would ask what chef was on that day hoping things would be better  the egg rolls that used to be great are old and over fried the insides are dark old and cold the main dish of steak and scallops was a joke  it contained   scallops cut into four pieces that were not even recognizable as scallops when i asked about no scallops being present they sent out the assistant manager  supposedly  a young kid about   when i expressed my disappointment he went back and told the chef and returned and said the chef said he put in  scallops and he would nothing about it  this kid was rude arrogant and obnoxious and should never have been sent to the table in the first place when i said i was going to write a negative review he said go ahead and dont forget to mention my name  finally the chef came out and said he would replace the dish  he brought out a new dish which was worse than the first for flavor and content in a rush to get the meal out it was undercooked and not edible|the good nice staff great location on fremont street lots of games  tablesthe bad low ceilings very bad smell inside very worn casino|was there for the first time today and the last time i will be there the food was not very good and the meal was overpriced for what we got i had the fajitas and my wife had the quesadilla with vegetables tasteless and just not very good at all|this place is the worst service is terrible we sat at the bar for  minutes with no service they were busy and the bartender was slammed however the manager walked the bar  times and didnt even ask if we needed drinks or wanted to order nothing its a joke this chips are always stale and the service always stinksgreat location great job on the upfitting of the building but not ever stepping foot in this place every time i give them another shot im disappointed big let down wish they were back on east when eric worked the bar and patrick was the manager i went there like  times a week and always had excellent service regardless of how busy they were|i booked the renaissance hotel through bookingcom and cancelled the booking days before but somehow the hotel still charged me after talking to the renaissance they said i had to talk to bookingcom even though they have the cash so i spoke with phillip regarding this situation which he said he would be more than happy to handle the situation just call his direct line  minutes after talking to him and calling back with bookingcom on the line he had mysteriously disappeared then they claimed he was gone for the day then he was in a meeting this hotel has horrible customer service and i wouldnt recommend them to anyone its been  days and still no remedy just going around in circles on giving me my money back ive called bookingcom  times and the hotel equally as much and each time it is a  minute hold to talk to someone|went for all you can eat prime rib on monday nights should have read the reviews online first the prime rib was mediocre at best and the six green beans that came with it were cold and undercooked we sat at the bar and our service was good but the food was far less than desirable i would have gladly paid  less for a burger and fries someplace else|so damn salty holy cowfriends wanted to try this for lunch when we were in the area and i had high hopes for this place wait for a little over  people was a long wait as this place is super busy once we got seated we noticed the place was packed and our service ended up being horrible i guess they utilize these egg signs on the tables to indicate if we need help or not and look we were the unhappy eggs of the place sat down and ran out of menus we waited for over  minutes then got menus after we all decided what we wanted to order it took another  minutes to get someone to help take our order the guy who took our order kept hitting my friends chair as he took his order over  times after we ordered our food took an okay amount of time to come out once it came out no one could eat because they ran out of utensils and he had to ask wishing a  minute period three different waiters to get us utensils how long could this possibly take then we ate our food everything was so saltyi had the burger and fries i know who gets a burger here but its what i wanted and when you have such a large selection it truly suffered my burger came without onions i was confused had to ask the waiter if they give onions and he was like they should patty was cooked with no seasoning at all bland tomatoes were frozen nothing special on it like damn i know its a plain burger but its so bad never get the burger fries were the most salty thing ive ever tasted in my life like wow im a person who licks my plate clean and i didnt finish this plate at all biggest waste of my money i tried my other friends dishes and we all agreed all the dishes were salty not acceptabledont recommend unless you want salty ass food for daysone star is just for the free yummy banana muffin for checking in|the egg and i on sahara sucks if you are black do not go there the hostess will probably have you sitting for an hour and still dont give you a seat i went there today cause i wanted some breakfast for the morning i got there and it was busy and people was waiting so i asked how long is the wait she said for how many and i said just me she told me that she would sit me when this one table was finish im in the biz so i know how it can get so i said ok it was a little after  am so i kept my self busy on my phone to pass the time i waited and waited for a while i saw plenty of tables finished and a lot of people that came after me got seated while i was there still waiting finally the table she promised me got done and i was ready as soon they would clean the table  minutes went by and i didnt get any acknowledgement by anyone and nobody even bothered to clean the table and it just so happen that i was the only black person there to eat i just wanted to eat some breakfast instead i waited about  minutes just to walk out without eating any food it was about  when i decided to leave the hostess still didnt even acknowledge that i was leaving passing right in front of her so i went to hash house a gogo where there took care of me right away and they where just as busy it pretty much bombed me out cause she could of sit at one of the  tops that became available instead of sitting people that came after me|booooo i lost my jacket and wallet maybe lost but i now no longer have my wallet or my jacket after visiting this establishment sucks too cause that was my favorite leather jacket  i can get the credit cards and id back fairly easily but that jacket has all the right scuffs in all the perfect places ugghh  management totally has their heads up their ass unless your vip blah blah blah  i never have these problems at sapphire or rhino|this review is solely for nancy the supervisor for this restaurant we came in at am on a weekday and they ran out of oxtail soup we asked politely howd they run out so fast which they usually dont and she started flipping out and called security on us this was seriously the most unprofessional demeanor a supervisor has ever bestowed she started talking amongst herself and getting crazy anyway if you ever bump into this lady beware the security was even mentioning to us that she always calls security on any little incident they too were mentioning that she was crazy and a waste of time when security is calledother than that the oxtail soup is normally delicious but because we received improper service and rude attitude from nancy we will not return again|roach on the table service is great food is excellent this leaves me turned off at the moment but i cant help hoping it was an accident for lack of a better word|dont get tempted to find a cute lion cub cubs stay cubs for a very short while you might find some caged animals not worth sending your money here vegas is not short of entertainment|i was walking with the family by glendale glitters and noticed haus was right down the street my sister loved the pretzels there so we wentthe staff didnt look to busy for a sunday evening and they took a good  minutes to even greet us which bugged me a bit after they finally greeted us the female hostess got mad at us for seating ourselves but we just listened to the guy up front and he told to seat ourselves  which we explained to the female now to the food i dont know if it is cause im mexican but the food was very bland and tasteless the pretzel was only okay at best the other thing we ordered was the stuffed mushrooms and you can only taste the mushroom itself wheres the sausage and other flavorssafe to say i wont be returning to this place|totally unhappy with our dinner here first of all we spoke to the lady at the front counter who referred us to the machines where you can self purchase your dinner tickets and pay she said to select the number of people eating and beverage service she didnt specify anything else so on to the selfservice atmstyle machine we went we purchased two adults one child and one drink the drink option didnt specify soft drinks or what there was some mention somewhere we saw about alcohol but we dont drink i thought  for soda seemed absolutely absurd when you are already buying a  buffet so thats why we only purchase one we are asked to walk all the way to the far back of the dining area to meet our waiter and be seated but there was a lot of confusion about where we were supposed to go and who was supposed to help us that took about  minutes and was very annoying you would think they would know how to seat people by now we sit down order waters and me with the wrist band asks for a root beer we go to get our food and immediately notice many entrees and side dishes arent fresh or replenished i make a salad wait a good  minutes and return to the slice meet and butterdrenched veggies just to see those are still not filled up i am not paying  for three pieces of dried up dark meet that look like they have been sitting there for the last hour very disappointing i inquire and i am told they are backed up about  minutes if i want to order meet ummmits pm and the place is less than  filled and nothing is being prepared fresh but i still have to wait  more minutes to get a darn piece of meet terrible service and very inefficient i settle for some other selections all of which were mediocre at best fruit wasnt ripe at all i realize its seasonal but then dont include it on the buffet if its just that bad at that point towards the end of our meal i notice the only couple seated within eye shot of us is drinking oj and they are not wearing wrist bands hmmmi call the little asian waitress over and tell her about the drink debacle and she just giggles and offers to get my husband and son a soft drink what about a manager to refund me for this stupid wrist band i purchased unknowingly when i dont drink poor service once again i decide dessert may the only redeeming factor left so we head to the dessert bar with high hopes we get there and to our dismay nothing is fresh just like the stinkin food everything looked like it had been sitting there for hours counters were messy cookies were as hard as a rock i took one of each just to see and we literally sat at the table slamming them against the tabletop without so much as a crumb cracking off bread pudding was completely empty and no one was working the counter we wait a good  minutes enjoying our  root beer and my husband pays the dessert bar a visit just to find everything the same as it was when i went so no dessert so lets recap no alcohol no soft drinks until the end of our meal when we have to ask the waitress about them being included in the expensive price tag no meet no veggies no fresh fruit and no fresh dessertsand  plus tip can you imagine most expensive meal we have never eatenbecause we left there hungry and disgusted ps on the way out i tried to stop by the front and talk to a manager but everything was closed off so that explains why nothing was being prepared fresh they were closing total epic fail and very unhappy with mb|maybe i am spoiled from going to fogo de chao and chimas but this place was not very good food was mediocre at best service of the meats was very slow also very minimal selection of sides i would not attend here again not recommend it|this review is in regards to christmas at the princess the grounds and light displays were beautiful  that being said the  parking fee was tolerable based on everything that was offered at no extra charge however the train ride was so fast that we couldnt even snap any good photos while on it and it wasnt as spectacular as i had expected based on the amazing light show you see at the enchanted plaza my almost  year old was bored and disappointed with the tunnel which really didnt meet my expectations either luckily we had the express wrist band for santa because knowing what i know now we would have never waited in line for  for an emailed copy of a barely santa photo is absurd no full shot none of the minimal decorations and a napoleon dynamite looking santa left me speechless when i opened the attachment in my opinion its pretty pathetic that a mall in the chicago suburbs woodfield mall can produce a much more spectacular display for santa the smores pits were over crowded and tables were not cleaned restrooms are minimal and friendly staff are nonexistent most were rude and were crowding the heat lamps all i can say is its most likely something that i never want to visit again|this review is strictly on quality of food  this place is not authentic mexican restaurant i bought a torta del pastor and was not close being a regular torta|was here for dim sum and lunch food was okay not that great serving cup and ice glass were very dirty be careful when they marked on your dim sum card  the restaurant owner lady have gut to ask my brother in law for tip but we already left tips on the table even though they didnt deserve it will not come back  tip is only courtesy if they deserved it |the location at the indian school location has really slid again unfortunately it only takes one  i brought my friend there for breakfastgreeted by michelle after ordering my friend said she really needs to find another job  she wont look at you while ordering stares off to side and looks up at ceiling while rolling her eyes when you ask her a question order came out wrong even after confirming it with her  even if in the area will make the drive to the scottsdale location which is awesome and great customer service|i used to come by casino once or twice a week most cocktail servers are great and are fun to talk to as they bring you a drink i came back today to wish everyone a happy holidays i hope the new year is better for both of us so can once again enjoy the casino|the first impression is always the best impression saturday night reservation for pm st the hostess he was rude we had a reservation for  people when you come in you have to knock on the door while my husband boss was still talking to him hostess thru the little window he closed it on him oookay and when he finally opened the door we followed him to the back of the restaurant instead of him walking us to the table  he pointed to where our seats were and he walked back to the front now the place was beautiful and the entertainment was greeeaattt i think we sat there for a while waiting on a server to pick our table up we didnt even have a server assigned to us  anyway we received our drinks super late i was served a dirty glass of coke i told the busser politely excuse my glass is dirty can i have another coke he said no problem took the glass to the bar sat it down i dont know if he realized it but he brung me back the same coke i told him to take away now i use to be a dishwasher for  years so i pay attention to things like this so i just didnt touch my drink we ordered appetizers garlic bread with cheese and calamari our party was passing the the food around and when it got to me i was disappointed because where you grip the plate there was dirty food stuck to the bottom of the bowl brim so you can feel it our plates werent washed properly i was grossed out ready to leave we couldnt find our server she disappeared some where so we were just sitting there  my asparagus soup was old it had a film on top from sitting so long and the middle was cold  you could tell our food sat in the window for a long time my shrimp was stale dried out we ended up being the last party on the floor they were closing we had to ask a busser for our check because no one knew where our server was  then we see her walking thru the back door like everything was okay  and this was by far the worst service weve had in a long time you need to fire the hostess and the server and retrain the busser  ps my husband got sick|if i was able to give this place negative stars i would the service is absolute shit the amount of food you get for all you can eat is ridiculous if a sushi place claims to be all you can eat then you should be able to pick and choose off that menu and it be unlimited this sushi place only allows you to choose  rolls for all you can eat meaning that it is not all you can eat they also only bring out one roll per serving so were leafy sitting here still hungry while they slowly prepare our food if you dont want to get all you can it its worse your paying  per roll for small rolls of sushi itd absoultly ridiculous my fiance came to this place to have a date night and its the worst place to come and eat|no no keep it moving my wife and i tried a few of the appetizers on the menu the prawns on the crostini was very salty on its own if you ate it with the small salad provided it was better still nothing special the spicey grasshopper oyster was pretty good different if you want that the fried potato encrusted shrimp were probably the best thing but could have benefited from some salt crab cakes were salty and mushy we are used to our crab cake with lumps of crab dont expect that here the crab cake did have a good sear but that did not make up for the mushy the new england clam chowder had good taste to it but there was some weird snotty looking things in it we inquired of the waiter what it was he got real bad attitude he never really answered he just blurted out ill take it off okay when you come to vegas on vacation the last thing you want is a waiter with attitude if you eat on the strip its expensive you should get an experience when you pay these prices to eat in short ive eaten in a lot of places but i wont be going back the food is just so so and i dont like the attitude|dont go here if youre a young attractive female on top of the fact that everyone in there is totally unprofessional all of the mexican dudes in that place were literally snickering like little kids and actually pointing at me licking their lips and raising their eyebrows and speaking in spanish about me like wtf dude no shame i almost video taped it ive never in my life been treated like that in a restaurant before how gross|i wish i could give this place zero starsaside from prostitutes that seem to choose this hotel of there as there hotel of choicei was awakened by a hotel employee walking in my room at  pmscared the crap out of mei finally got back to sleep and at  am another hotel employee tried to walk in my roomi also paid cash for one of the days i stayed and was also double charged on my credit cardsarah the manager did not seem to care that this took placeshe was beyond rudeshe actually had the nerve to tell me she did not believe this happenedi told her to do an audit of the room key entrysshe refusedshe finally agreed to refund my staythen she charged me anyways a few days lateri am reporting this hotel the bbb and disputing the charges with my bankthis place is simply awfulthe hotel is so loudyou can hear everything that is going on in other peoples rooms next to youif someone takes a showeryou get to listen to itdo not stay at this hell hole|giving one star to cox communications is going way overboard  they are the most inefficient unknowledgeable irresponsible insensitive company  we have been customers  years and they still keep pushing us around never ever ever keeping appointments or sending technicians who have any idea what they are do  they are the worst  the worst  go with centurylink and direct tv  save yourself the money and the angst terrible|i just came from this place i have been going here for the past year and a half i have always received good service and good food here now mind you this review isnt about the food as it is excellent i had a really bad experience just now at  am i stopped in to get a vegetable frittata for breakfast i walked in and the cashier named kate didnt greet me first of all and acted as if i was an intrusion for her to do her job she was very curt and cold to me and wouldnt even let me finish a sentence she continued to act very disinterested in my order now mind you i didnt think about her attitude until  after i made my order and paid for it with my credit card and sat down i happened to glance back over and saw her flirting with an older white dude it was obvious that she has an issue with people of color and didnt want to take more order in the first place as soon as the white dude walked up she was in his face going the extra mile with customer service and standing there continuing to flirt and talk its obvious that kate is more interested in using her job as a dating service and not actual work my other was ready and another older lady came over to give me my order and she was wonderful as always and i asked for the cashiers name she gave it to me and that is why im writing here and giving such a bad review get rid of kate she will continue to earn you bad reviews for your wonderful restaurant not sure if i will return|this taco bell location deliberately keeps your change  not kidding  if they owe you  they round down and give you back   i swear i couldnt believe it the first time let it go  but then they did it again  this time i asked for the correct change and they acted like no big deal  didnt even apologize  i guess they help themselves to your change as a tip  i told the employee that he couldnt do that and he looked at me like i was crazy  i got my change and i wont ever visit this location again  if you do make sure they give you the correct change  perhaps they split the overage when they close the registers at night|this place is horrible my prius got hit and the front end needed some work over the  weeks it took to get back i was lied to told it was taking so long because of the insurance company when i call amfam they stated they paid for the service  weeks prior when i finally got my car back it sounded differently when i stated i wanted to bring it back in to get fixed the shop told me that they have never worked on a prius before and have no idea what its supposed to sound like great another week in the shop and after getting it back it still wasnt running correctly took it back in a few days later and the manager then told me to lie to my insurance company so they could get more money out of them to try and fix the issue that they couldnt solve and so i could get a rental carummm yeah no i had to battle with amfam to get my car to another place to get fixed but when i did the new repair shop figured it out right away however what i didnt notice was all the dings and scratches that autocrafters put on my car while in the shop do a walk around your car before picking up from these people my car looks like crap now thanks to them after it was all done my car was in their shop for about a month and a half the second repair shop stated that it should have taken  weeks these people lie to you ask you to lie to others and have no clue what they are doing when my husband or i would show up to the shop just to check on the car all the service guys would be in the front office just standing around talking to the clueless ladies in the front when we would walk in theyd scatter like flies on crap and of course when wed ask to speak to one of them they were all busy working|i waited for  minutes just to make a payment because only one teller was working because the second teller went to lunch at  in the afternoon seriously  the bank only has two people working the teller windows all day and four people working behind desks in the bank and one greeter this isnt the first time either everytime i go there is a long wait i must say tho the tellers are polite and helpful even though they are the only ones able to work behind the window this branch is not considerate of customer service no apology either|if i could give this place  stars i would i love kfc but this one in particular is terrible so heres my story i came in tonight and went inside because the line was  cars to long all i ordered was  plain chicken littles only there was a kid being trained and i understand being new but come on he almost gave me the amount i paid back then the girl training him asked if he wanted to make my order so he went to put gloves on mind me he didnt wash his hands as hes making the sandwiches he take about  minutes he puts mayo and pickles so knoing this when given the bag i ask if theyre plain he says no i put mayo on them i then said its suppose to be plain so he goes back starts another  after another  or so minutes of waiting for him to put bread and chicken together we leave i get home to find the chicken smaller than the bread are you kidding me i paid  for something my  year old niece wouldnt get full off of also there was only  people wearing gloves out of about  i tried to call the number on the recipt not in service  went online to get the number same number i dont know what to do at this point i was craving this and its been over an hour and i havnt even eaten it yet dont go here unless you want poorly handled food and small amounts of it|i brought my daughter in yesterday this was our first experience and trust me it was bad the ladies at front counter were all very nice it didnt take very long for us to be seen my daughter cut her thumb pretty bad with scissors she is also autistic so poor girl thought she was dying with all the blood she saw the nurse or who we thought was a nurse came in and cleaned her wound and pretty much left us alone for  mins and she was in extreme pain i went looking for someone i actually found the dr sitting behind the counter he promptly got up and said hell be right there but someone else needed his attention he popped his head in our room i just thought it was ridiculous they wouldnt give her pain control he said he was sorry but his the only person able to give her a shotseriously my daughter was left in pain for over  mins he finally came back stitched her up i would never eve go back unless you enjoy pain they obviously didnt care|this was possibly the worst meal ive ever had the service was very good the potatoes were instant even though menu stated that the mashed potatoes had the redskins on them still   the macaroni and cheese was ridiculously bland with absolutely no sauce on it  the shibata bread for the french dip was hard as a rock on the bottom portion chicken fried steak was not more suit all dry and hard i cannot believe they serve food this bad and im not a picky eater|those of you who have had your wedding gowns preserved here might want to go ahead and open those boxes and see what you actually paid forright after my wedding more than  months ago i dropped my dress off to be preserved it was shipped off to their location that actually performs this service i was told that i would be contacted in roughly two weeks to approve the condition of my dress this call never came no one returned my calls they now have my  and my precious wedding gown fast foward to the end of december still nothing i call i stop in no one knows where it is good thing i have all of my receipts i get sent from location to location chaos the store that actually did have it spent forever trying to locate it once they finally did find it they inform me they had set it aside because it is a blingy wedding dress so they cant clean it and someone should have called me round and round we go no no one called me obviously i would have been here before the end of december but why do you advertise the cleaning and preservation of wedding dresses if basic lace and embroidery throws you into a panic you clearly shouldnt be servicing wedding gowns and arent able to do so i want my money and my dress back at that point there is a great deal of back and forth about how the real charge only should have been  dollars not  because they do not actually clean wedding gowns but she can spot clean my gown and preserve it and will do so for free after refunding my money cool im happy im thinking that theyre trying to make this right im probably never ever coming back but i will give them a chance to make it right i come back to pick up my dress and once again no one knows what theyre doing no one can find my dress ridiculous after a good  minutes of nonsense and a lot of upset on my part i get a closed and taped up box that is allegedly my dress they tell me i cant open it all to check again you dont even know what youre talking about because inside the box is another box and that box has a window im supposed to just trust you people to have the correct gown at this point i see that its my gown just wrapped in tissue paper and in no way sealed or preserved or protected i used to work in formal wear i can assure you this is not proper sealing packing tape and cardboard is not a seal from the elements not even when you use two boxes my dress actually has stains on it that it never had on it when i dropped it off i hope some wonderful yelpers out there can point me to someone in the east valley who actually knows what theyre doing|they have terrible customer service specially with their walkins they will not sell any single orders right now so save your trip going over there you have to pre order weeks in advance i went there to taste them with my daughter so i could see how good they were before i ordered them however i practically had to beg them for  tamales to buy and eat right there since i had driven all the way from chandler but the greedy manager only gave us   they took the menu down and wouldnt sell to anyone i wouldnt have ordered from them anyway they were very undercooked and lacked flavor good thing i got to try them they were all in such a rush to make them i guess i did order mine from a phoenix place but just a bit more expensive and lthey were more delicious to the people who dont know if you do preorder and dont pick up in time they will sell them to someone else  they are rude over the phone if they answer but when i was there they were just letting it ring and ring how are the customers going to make changes to their orders or know that theyre not accepting walk ins if they dont answer the phone|my fiance a native of phoenix is a huge fan and has been coming here since she was a little girl  now that shes moved away this is one of the first stops that she and i make during our annual christmas visit to her family  im from the east coast so i enjoy the the authentic mexican as well  not this year  our visit happened about  yesterday stfirst off they get our order wrong  we ordered one chicken taco one carne asada taco one tostada and two beancheese burritosone with extra cheese  we received everything but the carne asada tacowhich came out as a burrito and neither of the beancheese burritos had the extra cheese  not huge mistakes but annoying nonethelessthe big problems came when my fiance bit into her tostadaice cold refried beans that tasted funny  same with the burritosbeans that couldnt melt the shredded cheese inside  i didnt have a bite of either burrito because my fiance couldnt tell which one has extra cheese neither  the biggest problem came a bit later that day when she developed food poisoning  she was up all night dealing with it  my taco and carne asada burrito were goodwhile food poisoning sucked she was a bit more upset that she can no longer go to filibertos   cant go back  sorry memories|first time in for oxtail bones which we needed for a recipe was stunned that they charge  a lb for bones also agree with other reviewers abot the poor customer service|im sitting here now at this jiffy lube and have been for the past hour and a half i came in for a simple oil change it took them over  minutes to even check me in its been another  minutes and my oil change still isnt done dont come here if youre looking for something quick i cant comment on the prices yet because i havent even gotten the bill|this is an honest review that i hope the employees and service providers really take to heart because everything that i witnessed was just atrocious i was not an actual patient but i was with one in severe and sudden pain this is a review from an objective observer who saw the i professionalism at its worst from how they treat people to how they maintain the facilities im really just appalled this place even stands supplies are basic at its best and so are the skills of these professionals i would seriously be so ashamed if i said i worked at this hospital knowing how the standards are so low they will talk about everyones personal matters and blast it out loud they literally make fun of their patients just to create some entertainment for their pathetic work lives they will take their pretty ass time to treat you while they have disturbing conversations about their lives sodomy work gossip they talk about their own just as much as they talk about you hah etc and they will lie to you and laugh in your face when you ask for the truth or clarification of your exams results the dude with the weird facial hair and scratches on his face walked by and stated to everyone behind the counter youve really gotta see this shit everyone comes and swarms to check out the xray and the whole situation becomes unbearably uncomfortable whats worst is that when you have the guts to ask whats up the only reply you get from everyone is well the doctor has to confirm the results just be patient insert snarky fake smile here we left without treatment screw this place and the staff|they are con artists they hustles me into filing an insurance claim for chipped windshield that was not there last time i washed the car myself and used incredibly sub par materials there was excess gunk on the windshield that wiped off with a towel and saliva the techs saliva the chip is cloudy and more visible than ever i have had a bigger chip repaired by safelite in the past and you could not even tell there was a chip after they finished im certain this crap they put on my windshield isnt going to last  months thank god it has a lifetime warranty not update insurance went up by  a month yes a glass claim will raise your insurance|poor poor poor customer service seriously their credit card machine was broken and they failed to tell me that before i ordered my food waiting patiently for it to be prepared when it was time to pay i was unable to due to their faulty machinery the girl at the front asked me to give her multiple cards none of which worked i didnt have cash on meafter i had been standing there waiting for  minutes waiting for this girl to try and figure out the machine the owner walks over wondering what was taking so long they try again and are unable to fix it then the owner had the nerve to ask me if i wanted to drive across the street to go to the atm absolutely not i obviously have other things to do since i ordered my food togo and after making me wait  minutes due to your screw up comping me an  gyro doesnt seem like that great of a loss especially since it was probably gonna get thrown out anyway never coming back they dont deserve my business|used to love shopping here and tend to find good items however the customer service is always lacking and the attitude on returns is very unnecessary their policy isnt realistic and to be upset and exude attitude over having to look up a receipt is beyond ridiculous  the manager is the worse here might be worth driving to other locations or shopping at other retailers at this point|the service here is aggravating half the time i have to shout into the drive thru speaker because i have been sitting there for a few minutes being ignored this location has the double drive thru and they obviously cannot handle it the guy taking drive thru orders and taking the cash is also wiping down the eatin trays multitasking is great if you have the time he can barely handle the other two jobs the fries are barely ever fresh the food is mediocre even for mcdonalds they dont even apologize when they mess up your order which happens often if you have the time drive down to boulder hwy and flamingo much better service and food is way better|i work in the wells fargo building and therefore thought it would be fairly easy to go downstairs and get a money order from the bank the teller refused to allow me to purchase a money order as i did not have an account with wells fargo ive never heard of this before i can go to a gas station but not a bank to get a money order i was willing to pay the  fee so it wasnt as if i was looking for any free service with recently having moved to the west coast where wells fargo banks appear to be more prevalent there were none in my home state i will not be moving my business to a wells fargo any time soon and i recommend you do not as well|new clients bewaremy insurance covers a free cleaning each year this office refused to do a normal clean but would only schedule a deep clean i agreed since new to the area but theni work out of town and travel a lot i missed one appointment due to work when i tried to reschedule they said they would not because they were not interested in helping us anymore i get it is a business but that rude lady at the front desk needs to be let go and i will never take my family to a dentist as disrespectful and unwilling to help as this office was worst experience with a dental office i have ever had|this restaurant leaves a lot to be desired when they only have one cashier jumping between the counter and the drive throw not a positive experience to bad because i like kfc but this restaurants needs major help|im an over critical person sometimes with this co but i have my favswhen i pay  for coffee i just want it right and maybe full and oh we can skip the cracked lidglad my lids saw that before it caused me griefill try them once more and see that will be a good test|i really wanted this place to be good tried it three times today i had a chicken california burrito mushy rice bland beans flavorless chicken the frozen tortilla wasnt warmed up all the way chewy and dense friendly staff fast service the chips are good if you can overlook them being stored in a dirty looking trash can this place is not for me|weve been members for a month now and im totally underwhelmed the sales guy who signed us up was enthusiastic and personable but once we signed on the dotted line he disappeared numerous emails to him have gone unanswered which is very frustrating in every class the instructors try to upsell you to private training supplements etc which is just plain annoying during the initial move it session i asked the trainer to show me how to use some of the weight machines but he just showed me a series of stretches and then tried to sign me up for future personal feebased training sessions it is almost impossible to make a reservation for a class online so you are left to contact the individuals in charge of those areas eg pilates but good luck getting them to return your call or email especially if you have let them know that you are not interested in private sessions finally weve had lt bucks disappear from our account for no apparent reason when i called the corporate office to find out what happened the representative said they were used for some service that i had never heard of but she did credit them back to our account if things dont get better we will be canceling our membership soon|the ikea of all things outdoorsnot my kind of place because it has waaaaaaaaaayyyyyy too much going on which for me is sensory overload and makes me want to run for the hills  in my opinion lots of their stuff is cheaply made with pride you know where and grossly overpriced for the qualityothers may consider this their go to place but not me  whatever you do dont eat at their restaurant unless of course youre a fan of chicken mcnuggetsgood times near seizure world|food was nasty hash browns not well done asked for egg well done but wasnt pancakes were the worst ever tasted  waiterzulfa tried her best with good service and offered to take of drinks from bill because my well done eggs smelt bad|i really want to give tj a higher rating but they are already out of spiral hams for christmas my previous  visits over the past four months have been frustrating they are out of basic cheeses they supposedly stock frequently and there have been many other items as well they cannot keep up with their stock i think its time to take a break from shopping at trader joes|the food is pretty fair for a barrestaurant however its not worth their prices i normally get food to go on my way to work and have noticed that there are extra  cent upcharges for them to put sauces in containers so there is usually an additional   in extra fees just because theyre not putting sauces on a plate also the bacon wrapped scallops which used to be  for  have now been reduced to  and tack on the extra  for them to put the chutney and cole slaw in a container im just sick of being nickel and dimed when im already paying  for a steak but an extra  for onion rings this place  has left a bad taste in my mouth both literally and figuratively|we stayed at the luxor so we decided to try the buffet downstairs for lunch  it was oknot much to choose from  it came out to  and some change for  people  it satisfied our hunger for the time being but i dont think i would go back|i purchased  mini cupcakes for a party and they put all the cupcakes in little plastic takeaway sandwich boxes by the time i arrived at the party all the cupcakes were smashed together and it was very embarrassing if youre going to pay that much for cupcakes they should all be in individual slots so they dont move why you transport ive tried calling the manager and left six messages with no return phone call this is horrible customer service  and they should never serve cupcakes in a little plastic sandwich box with no separation  highly overpriced and extremely unprofessional since we had a big party i guarantee you that no one will ever frequent their cupcake business after leaving  messages with the manager  still no return phone call  every time   the manager is busy its a good thing i know a lot of people in this town  this is something i should follow through with the better business bureau maybe this review will finally get me a return phone call or message|i found a wood chip in my sandwich and when i brought it to their attention they apologized but didnt seem too terribly concerned i told them what was on my sandwich so it could be cleaned out but im not confident that happened|shop here if you want to be treated like a criminali found what i had thought to be a classic gem during glendale glitters cute hippieish right up my alley  i walked in and was greeted by what seemed to be a friendly staff until i started looking around every corner some one was right behind me watching my every move i was checking out some necklaces and asked who i presumed to be the owner if they were authentic crystals she replied with a stale yes as if not even interested her overly friendly staff also helped me with some necklaces saying they would hold them at the front for me not a huge deal ive worked in retail and i know people steal so i was not bothered by that but when i go to check out over  in jewelry i go around to the front to check out some other last minute bracelets when i look up and see the blond who was helping me point at me to the manager as if to let her know i was stealing i was appalled by what i was seeing they quickly tried to play it off as if they were talking about a sweater i understand being overly cautious but to make me feel uncomfortable shopping is just ridiculous i still bought the necklaces against my better judgement of giving undeserving businesses my hard earned money i will not shop here again or recommend to anyone i knowwith such a cool place you would hope to find humbled souls i was rather disappointed|the christmas cactus garden was wonderful couldnt see any of the blood from wrapping the lights around the needles wonder how they did thatfactory walk through was worth the free chocolate but  for a small hot chocolate is sad we bought some because reviewers recommended it my  year old suggested i share my recipe with the company my  year old attempting to make the financial loss more palatable pointed out that the whipped cream was like the expensive kind in the red can my  year old said for that price shouldnt it have been homemade toothe mexican hot chocolate had more flavor not worth the price if you must share one and write an honest review to spare others i felt worse for the employees who must be desperate to provide for their families to sale such a disappointing product with a smile  star for lights and candy  star for employees doing what they must to support their family ps  here in las vegas you can also see thousands of lights free of charge year round on the strip  welcome to vegas|this is one of my favorite sushi restaurants in las vegas unfortunately the staff and management have lost interest in this location i am not easily offended usually i just let it go this was such a disrespectful juvenile offensive act that i will never return ive been eating here  or  times a month for  years so this is no small decision eating lunch at am and blaring over the speakers of the restaurant is the song i dont give a f uncensored version kids are walking into this place with mom and grandma at this time childish bs like this has no place in a public establishment and certainly not for a lunch crowd after pm if you have no class fine but at lunch with kids this is lewd behavior and it shows poor judgment and a lack of respect innuendo in the menu is one thing gross lewdness is another im reporting this to clark county treasurer business license division im also sending a letter to each of the clark county commissioners im also sending a letter to steve wolfson regarding this incident poor judgment like this makes you wonder what else  they dont give a f about|my family and i stayed here this weekend true the rooms look just as they do in the pictures it was beautiful we had a room facing the strip in a high floor i loved the suite and agreed the room was clean comfortable and felt new however it was so loud the party by the pool lasted way into the night like  am we asked for a quiet room old people lol also i did not like the attitude of  the staff here they were polite enough buti felt like i was bothering them and waiting on them from the front desk folks on the phone  to the security guards they acted like they did not want to be there and i was annoying them i wouldnt stay here again shame|lakeside continues

renovations signs on the doors if the renos are done take the signs off the door if theyre on maybe list it on here|ive been here a few times its good not the best but  its good enough to satisfy your sushi craving today i came in for lunch ayce sushi with my niece who is  she got charged the adult price of  i feel like that is too much i mean for kids under  its  and i feel like thats a fairer price for her i even asked about it before i started ordering but the server didnt respond to me and in the end charged me full unfortunately because of that i probably wouldnt come back here sushi places are a dime a dozen and this one isnt that special it was convenient thats it|i went in on nov th to get a full set acrylic with gel lacquer i usually go to polished but i waited last minute before an event i had coming up and need to go in after normal salon business hours for a full set i spent  with gratuity and two weeks later when i was ready for a fill every single nail was lifting off the technician at polished said he hadnt seen that level of poor application in his whole career i called get nailed  to let them know i was unhappy with my service and the person who answered the phone took my name and phone number and said a manager would call me well the manager never called in short save your money and go to a reputable salon that cares about the level of service they perform|food was excellent but service was awful chang was my server and lets just say i couldve gotten better service at mcdonalds it took  minutes to get my first drink getting a refill was a joke and he would walk by several times without clearing away the dirty plates they werent that busy and he had zero sense of urgency so it wasnt like he was busy action stations werent staffed so trying to get your meat cut or a pasta made was almost impossible the sous chef himself actually saw that i was waiting for a long time and got an employee to help me kudos to that chef for being on top of things manager was seating guests and was very unprofessional calling guests baby i watched her get in an argument in front of me with my server chang as well as a table that had one too many people she even threw her hands up in the air at the guests yikes this was my second time to this buffet and the first time was phenomenal so maybe i just caught them on a bad day i dont know|my party of four had reservations for noon on saturday  we were seated promptly and asked for our drink orders  one of our party ordered a soft drink coffee and water  she was never brought the water she ordered  when our drinks arrived all of our drink glasses were very spotted  the timing between appetizer and our meals was fine  our food fried pickles and burgers was very good  service on the other hand was very slow especially taking into consideration that the restaurant was not busy  our glasses went empty for long periods and we had to ask for refills  we had to ask for the table to be cleared after the appetizers and the meal  check was brought before we were asked if wed like dessert  we did order dessert but the apple cobbler tart was brought to the table cold and without the whipped cream  all in all i was very disappointed in our visit  definitely not the experience i would have expected with it being a wigwam restaurant|food is ok but a little pricy for what you get  front of the house can be less than accommodating  showed for our reservation at  waiting  minutes and still not seated  there are open tables but still we wait hungry begging to give you our money but still we are treated like we owe them something  i usually dont complain but the attitude we are receiving is unprofessional and insulting when we ask how much longer  understandable if it was friday or saturday but its tuesday night  please fix the front of house then maybe the it will be worth coming back|the customer service provided from this business is just the worst cold food employees not personable a just dont care atmosphere the management really need to look into the employees they bring on board to work in their establishment|the girl who attended me was too lazy to check if there were boots my size in other store and he only thing i wanted to buy she said she couldnt find the price tag|walked in and waited at the sandwich counter for  minutes and was never asked what i wanted  so i went to the salad counter  feet away and ordered my sandwich i was then immediately told in a very rude voice by an employee youre supposed to order in front of the right counter  my response was that i wasnt being helped there at which point i was now being ignored  so i thought to ask for a manager and then realized the rude behavior actually came from the very young manager  the evenings are ran by a by bunch of kids that know nothing about customer service  oh and the food is average so im giving two stars instead of one|we had purchased tickets to the santa train last year and really had a great experience when we went however i could not say the same for this year i had bought tickets for the santa train well in advance for december th at am once i picked up my tickets at will call i asked the gentleman where the lines for boarding formed he explained that anywhere there was a stool would be a boarding area i was the first person lined up since i had arrived about am to ensure i would be able to get seating together for my family and friends total of  people i chose to line up at the first stool i came to which was located right behind the dining caras time drew closer to the am boarding time myself and several other people who were in line near me began to question why there were so many lines forming the woman behind me thought there should have been only two boarding areas and there were in fact three stools therefor three lines she was told as well to line up where ever there was a stool i questioned two other people over the coarse of my  minute stand in line and both confirmed if there was a stool there it would be a boarding area  minutes before boarding someone came and closed the door to the dining car which sent nerves running through me and all the people around me who had been waiting there was an rotc gentleman had walked by at that moment and i asked him why they had shut the door he was not really informative however stated he did not think this was a boarding area at this moment we noticed that they were starting to board behind us i asked him if he could address this concern and perhaps have someone board us from this door he went down to the other boarding area however did not seem phased nor did anything to helpi then took it upon my self to walk through the caution area at which point i boarded the train leaving my party standing by the dining car i explained to the gentleman the situation and that we had been there for min standing in line only to have the door shut on us he did not seem interested and told me to go ahead and have a seat somewhere i was able to reserve and hold my seats so that my family and friends were able to sit together we were seated towards the front of the train and since santa started making his way from the rear of the train by the time he reached our car we were nearly back to the station i felt his time with my daughter was extremely rushed as he tried to great the remaining passengers i feel the organization and preparation from the individuals who run this event was much better last year than this year i have not decided if this is an event i will continue to do again in the future|got this room as part of a promotional eventtimeshare purchase presentation this place does not seem like a resort at all not close to strip views of empty ugly lots and we heard gun shots i ran out of presentation too bad i was looking at staying at a resort|shocking service i was very optimistic at first the chap in the shop was very helpful and we arranged a home visit to take measurements as arranged they came out and measured the stairs we wanted carpeting all goodwe go back to choose our carpet and they had lost our measurements they were nice enough about it but it was rather annoying so we choose our carpet and arrange another date for the measurements measurements are taken and were told someone will be in touch to quote happy daysdays later  nothing in the end i give them a call very surly telephone manner and it took a very long time to find my detailsanyhoo we get the quote and arrange a date for the fitting they come as arranged to fit the underlay and say they will be in touch to fit the carpet a few days go by whilst we are walking about on bare underlay and exposed carpet grippers they call to say that they cant come out at the weekend and would need to be a weekday between  and  who is in then we both work full time to save any further hassle david takes a day off work not idealthey come and install the carpet and actually have to redo the underlay they had put down as it was not right they finished the job and made no effort to tidy up leaving us with all the rubbish all in all not very impressed more with the customer service than the work we are pleased with the carpet but it was such a hassle to get it done|this place is great for individual jump but not good with parties i just had my sons rd birthday there two days ago and the kids werent able to have too much fun they where rushing us literally the whole time  so much so that they even had the nerve to pick up our food that we paid for while we where still eating and threw it away then tell us the party is over and we must leave now when it was  and in fact we had  more minutes  left  the party wasnt supposed to be over till pm and on top of that gave my sister attitude when she asked about it i paid  for my kids birthday here the least they could of done was show my family friends and i respect and if you pay for three hours then you should get the full time you paid for|ive never been so disappointed as i have been today picking up my lunch at this paradise bakery location i called in my order waited  minutes as they had asked  when inside they made me wait at the end of a very long line to get my order i could tell that my sandwiches had already been made i took a look at that sandwiches and some of them were soggy messy and lacked the ingredients that were so accustomed to getting doubt if ill ever come back to this location again|food quality  out of price  out of ambiance  out of service  out of highlights overpriced mediocre chinese food with bad service you are better off going to panda express at the mall   okay lets preface this with the fact that i am an asian american raised in a part of california where good chinese restaurants can be found in unusually high concentrations im used to my wonton noodle soups costing somewhere from  to  with excellent quality im also used to service being spotty at asian restaurants so that isnt really unexpected my girlfriend and i came in for lunch craving some tasty hot noodle soup we sat down and got the beef brisket noodle soup and the pork wonton with chicken broth noodle soup the total rewards pricing for each was  side note everyone should get total rewards pricing since its free to get a card from the casino and works at half of the casinos on the stripthe price was already a little over the top from what i would pay for great noodle soup but our craving was strong and we knew our options were limited sat down waited several minutes before anyone acknowledged us finally got our order in only took about  minutes for the food to come out the beef brisket noodle soup was oily beef broth not the kind you would want to drink a bowl full of the noodles were not bad the beef pieces were ok overall the broth really killed the bowl for me and the fact that it was a  bowl the pork wonton noodle soup had a lighter broth it was definitely drinkable and tasty but the wontons tasted really off like they werent made out of pork the noodles were the same house made ones there was random pieces of seaweed and tiny dry shrimp a weird mix but not completely surprising from an asian bowl overall not worth the price or even worth visiting you are honestly better off going to panda express|imagine this  you spend  on a wedding package  for the reception at one of their restaurants called the beach club another  for a site fee for one of their ballrooms the after party and the another  to  for a set up fee to have a bartender on duty in the ballroom for the night  yet the hotel division of tropicana headed by yolanda villanueva doesnt want to comp your room the night before and of the wedding  instead she wants to offer you a reduced rate of  for the two nights when hotelscom is offering two nights for   how insulting  so much for a discount  yolanda also wanted to take  off the  resort fee and give you a couple of passes for one of the shows on the strip  and this is contingent upon you blocking  rooms for your wedding guests  talk about not valuing you as a client  the wedding planner donata solana of tropical weddings lv was a bright spot and she was very professional  unfortunately she has no control over the hotelroom reservation aspect  i made sure none of my guests booked their stay at the tropicana and we ended up booking our stay at south point for substantially less  a classless organization no doubt|ok they are not local friendly  no drink comps unless you bet over  dollars they have a special room with glass on the side for vip and they have more than half of the place covered for special guests that never appear whoever owns this place is a moron and only seems to cater to high roller vip types great screens  but no seating dumb and no drinks go to the orleans the screens are not as good but you get drink comps seating to watch the game and hotdogs for  bucks|firstly i have booked with jet luxury twice  both in honolulu and in las vegas never had any serious issues up to this point however today changed thatto begin as the other reviews show here there is nothing wrong with the properties we love the vdara in las vegas that said where things diverge is in the staff and management of jet luxury beyond awful wish i could leave a star reviewi had booked back in july of  for an upcoming trip and was told to follow up and verify room type a few days before arrival with manager amanda f on doing that and leaving a voicemessage never received a followup i called the general line and spoke with an agent and explained that amanda had advised to call jet luxury little did i know apparently the agent went to amanda and indicated the call was awkward and that she felt pressured excuse me really now the ceo richard b apparently said he listened to a recording of the call i asked for it never got a copy sent to me moreover amanda the director of operations then sent an email that was cced to every single jet luxury employee including ceo richard above she accused me of pushing her employee and making the situation very awkward for her then she went on to say that their agents have many calls daily and that the agent who gave me the room number of the exact onebedroom fountain view suite at the complex ultimately did not know how to address the call properly i never directly asked for the room number i had been to vdara before and wanted to stay in the same room we enjoyed and if agents cannot handle a call why did she not just have amanda call me back if she seriously was that worriedi am never booking through jet luxury again a lack of customer service no respect for loyal customers and the use of humiliating me as a customer in front of every jet luxury employee is completely out of line disgraceful company go elsewhere to book  as i did|received very rude service the counter person obviously had a problem with me for some reason|i frequently come here for my coffee and a bagel ive also had a couple of their sandwiches but i am not a big fan they are usually too oily too bland the only thing i would get on occasion is the thai chicken salad but its quite pricey for what you actually getthis particular store is so close to my home and that is the only reason for me to come back staff is very unfriendly and so terribly slow also i have ordered bagels for meetings and they couldnt be bothered putting them in smaller paper bags but threw  bagels in one big giant bag and threw the creamcheese on top of it i had to stop somewhere else to buy a couple of paper plates so it wouldnt look too bad at the meeting ive recently asked if i could have  paper cups for coffee while buying  bagels plus cream cheese and it was not an option at all very poor service|stayed in a suitenice room but horrible customer service  do not stay here  everyone seems to not care whether you are the front desk or over the phone|host told us to wait a second and to have a seat then seated  parties ahead of us went up to the desk to ask why that was and it turns out she didnt take our name so if we hadnt gone up to ask we would have waited another half an hour you had one job host it doesnt take a phd to do|this is a buffet that touts itself as the bestwith heightened expectations from the advertising and word of mouth i decided to test the place out what i ended up eating was a plethora of either borderline tasteless food or foods that tasted of only one flavor the only saving graces were the prime rib the clam chowder which upon eating a second time the clam was sandy and the dessert the bread pudding was mehonly go here with low expectations otherwise you will be dissapointed the place has potential but it just needs better quality control over everything it has the variety but not the quality|a restaurant on cruise controli gave a  star review to try to call attention to the crispy red curry duck  it was full of fat and gristle comprising almost half the duckchef suntorns signature dish lacks quality and care giving the impression this restaurant doesnt pay attention to the food it puts on its tables  the website price is  while the actual price is  further evidence basil thai doesnt care enough about its business to update its websitethai taste on east blvd is a much better alternative|terrible customer services kids want some hot chocolate and sundae but outside window closed so we dined in seemed like the server penny did not have any patience we asked him for one hot chocolate and one sundae he rushed to leave we asked him if he knew what we ordered he simply answered classic would be good for you excuse me can we choose our own topping at least before you leave the worst thing was the bill came one minute after he served the dessert  hey we havent started eating yet|we stayed in a hotel in the area and ordered from this restaurant using seamless we ordered egg rolls tom yum soup and pad thai with chicken and vegetables first it took an hour and a half to deliver when the confirmation email said one hour and fifteen minutes we were very disappointed from the food  the egg rolls were cold probably made as soon as the order came in so an hour and a half until we got them and came with a very watereddown chili sauce the soup was extremely oily and actually tasted more like onion soup nothing like any tom yum soup we had before and the pad thai was also very oily and had very little chicken and even less vegetables for which we paid extra we ended up throwing away most of the food since it was simpy inedible|wowthis used to be a favoritewhat happenedhost rudewaitress worseshe came alive  complained about staffing problems when it came time to tipportions scanty  special order made incorrectly with no apologytoo badour last visit|i feel bad using the coffee free wifi to give it such a bad review buta this is a coffee place i came here twice and both times the coffee was horrible i tried different types still horribleb the coffee is reasonably priced and also the muffins everything else is  just so super expensivecthe wifi is so sloweither dont give free wifi or give a normal speed one  there were on  people at the placei guess unless i want a muffin i wont come here again|took a chance on this place because of an entertainment coupon and bought the bbq sampler  big mistake  this is by far the worst bbq i have ever had in pittsburgh and that includes the likes of eat n park  i wont ever waste my money here again|the guys that work here rude and sad treat people with lack of respect i feel sorry for our snow birds who come to our  great city|nice resort  the problem is the timeshare scam that is being perpetrated here  i tend to trust people and it was a huge mistake for me to come here and get exposed to the marketing presentation  they tricked me in multiple different ways during the presentation into buying something that has little or no value  i am now fighting the situation  its a drain on your time and money you do not want to attempt  i highly recommend that if you are not bullet proof against marketing tactics to never walk into this place  its a resort of thieves that want to take your hard earned dollars and give you dimes in return  it started with a special deal with  over the phone for four days  and then turned into a timeshare presentation later that was never disclosed over the phone  save your money and your time and your sanity and avoid these people  they are devilsif anyone is looking for further proof of the scam please see the below pasted text of reviews from other yelp members about this vendor i took the time to look through all reviews on this vendor and include belowfrom r j modesto cahttpwwwyelpcombizholidayinnclubvacationslasvegasdesertclubresortlasvegasso for the sales pitch we originally werent even informed we would have to sit through anything but were deceitfully told we were reviewing an under construction location the truth came out in a letter from holiday inn scheduling us for a preview right in the middle of one of our days they put a  hold on our credit card and wouldnt release the funds unless we sat through the whole thing being coerced into a sales event for something one cannot afford sets a negative tone from the outset  then they were inflexible with the schedule and forced us to attend it right through our infants nap time so we had a fussy baby to tend through it  not too happy b lhuntington beach cai spent  while making reservations i was offered a great vacation in a resort for  being under the impression the deal was due to accumulating points as a result of the numerous reservations being made let me just say if i were clearly aware on the phone this deal was a timeshare and attending a sales seminar was necessary i would have said no on the spot no matter what the deal was when i attempted to make reservations months later for the deal i found out it was a timeshare scam i contacted holiday inn and asked for a refund of the  which had already been charged to my credit card  i was directed to  different people  all snarky and not helpful avoid this place  i was fooled  please stay away far away  how this place continues to operate in america like this boggles my mind  i have emailed holiday inn corporate the major credit companies and nothing happens  i cannot understand how a company like this persists in america  its really amazing  it really is|honestly i tried these cleaners because they are close to my house but they did a terrible job on my jacket i asked for a button to be fixed and im not sure if it was because of a language barrier or what but that didnt get done when i took my coat out of the bag i saw that the food stain that prompted me to get my jacket cleaned in the first place was still there i was pretty disappointed and am going to take the jacket elsewhere to get it recleaned|we started with the spinach dip for the table  the spinach cheese dip tasted great however the bread for dipping was basically cut tortilla which should have been toasted but it was not  i ordered the bbq sandwich after asking the staff what dish is the best  the sandwich was a normal bbq sandwich and i asked for upgraded fries which came out under cookedsoggy  when you think of lagasse you think an entree would have some magic this did not  it took about  mins after we asked the server for new fries  my friend ordered a salad and could not eat it because the dressing was horrible  honestly the worst dressing i have ever had  it was so sour i wonder how this could be served to paying customers  the manager never came over to apologize and the only person who seem to care was the bus person who did come over and say sorry to us  it was also hot in a uncomfortable way and i wonder if they turn on the hot air to get people to leave  we had to leave before the football game ended because we were literally sweating  very disappointed because i could of went to any sports bar to see a football game and i choose this and i was wrong sorry lagasse this place is poor in every way  i personally will never come back due to the poor food and lack of management|this is one of the few times that yelp steered me wrong  we stopped for lunch today prior to a nearby doctors appointment and ordered the angus burger along with the creole filet medallions  i should have said something immediately when the latter arrived as the meat was most certainly not filet  i think it was sirloin  it also was not medallions as it wasnt a round cut the sirloin was simply cut in half  my companion said that the burger did not seem to have the taste or texture you would expect of angus meat either while the fries were too heavily salted  the service was fine but having sirloin passed off as filet is pretty inexcusable|dreary experience came in before pm had to wait  minutes for a table in a nearempty restaurant we ordered and waited  minutes we were finally served with a few dishes ignored and the rest cold  minutes later bright spotilights came up so that they could start cleaning up  we asked the speak to the manager who had the lights lowered slightly she also comped one drink on a  bill  particularly unappetizing was the  molcajete de mariscos which was a shallow bowl of gummy overcooked riced with a thin covering of fish and a few shrimps|had to cancel because one of the people in our group was feeling sick  went through a big process with the manager talking to the owner on the phone and finally they said wed get a refund   months later still no refund  thats the definition of stealing to me  dont trust these people|not sure what the hype is about most definitely not  stars the middle aged woman that runs this place is efficient but the furthest thing from friendly  shes almost militant we witnessed her being so curt with customers that one group left she literally grabbed the menu out of my hand before i was done ordering they have very strict rules here and make no excuses exercising them breakfast will stop being served at am sharp no ifs ands or buts reads one sign another restrooms for customers only  greets you on the door the food was basic as basic gets worthy of a solid  stars and the location is convenient if you live nearby but thats it so if you arent coming for service and you arent coming for food then why bother coming at all pass on this joint|im so fed up with this service center in the beginning they were wonderful but have declined over the years i cant get calls returned when they follow up on a service appointment and i voice the problem they say they will call me back and never do ive inquired about additional warranty repairs etc and promised calls which i never receive simultaneously the sales department solicits heavily through mail email and by phonemy most recent complaint is im traveling and my coolant light came on i was  miles from the closest bmw service center in freezing conditions and they wouldnt give me a recommendation of what aftermarket coolant i could put in my car i asked to talk to a different representative and they transferred me to the parts department who never picked up the call i called back and asked again for someone different they just sent me back to the same uncooperative service manager their customer service is terrible it certainly doesnt make me want to give them any more business|this dollar was easy to find in the airport since their line had about  people waiting in it while the other lines had  or  customers  the line took over an hour even though i was dollar express apparently doesnt matter here  after trying to upsell insurance i was sent to my car  the first car i chose had a low fuel light on so i parked it and grabbed another midsize by the way a nissan sentra is not similar to a dodge charger even though i was promised similar to a charger  this car had a bit over  of a tank and the attendant noted it and said it was fine and to return it with the same amount of fuel  the car was beat up but ran fine and i had no issues returning the vehicle  two weeks later i get a charge for the missing fuel  i am on hold with their customer service as i write this so far for  minutes  dollar overall has subpar service and vehicles but that is what i expect when you go with the cheapest but this experience has been terrible|burgers  are getting greasier every time i stop  chicken is fine friesare good and custard is great|i really really want to like the wonder bar  bar area is cozy and they make a good cocktailthe problem starts one you sit down for dinner  the service at least the last  times i went there is marginal to poor which is not what you expect when you are paying  for a steak  we ordered appetizers and once we finished the dirty plates sat on our table for  minutes  finally we stacked them up and forced them on a passing waiter same with the saladsoup plates except no waiter passed so we had to juggle them once our entrees came  you would think the waiter might check in at least once during the course or possible clear dirty dishes before you bring out a new course  well a trip to the restroom taught me that the waiters hang out by the kitchen and talk to each other until orders come out  obviously no one is managing the placefood was good  i had a filet and it was done perfectly medium  the crab bisque was salty and it came out in an oversized bowl so it looks like there is not much in the serving  i think the bowl was the reason for the lukewarm tempsorry guys but i can recommend it for cocktails but not dinner  i gave it  chances over the year or two it has been open and service is still to be nice severely lacking there are lots of other places in town to get a good steak or seafood|the food is good and cheap perfect for me but they really need to work on whoever that young girl is that answers the phone her attitude is horrible i think its the managers daughter she interrupts you and is very rude its kind of ridiculous not a fan of the customer service|one star for the falafel terrible service we were the only ones in the restaurant and the waiter was so rude chatted on his phone served us cold bread and insisted thats how they serve it had to ask for water no thank you or bye when we left small portions high prices no thanks will never go back again|i would give a zero if possible the employees are the worst they never stock the shelves properly they have the worst attitudes and the manager james is very disrespectful when i called to complain nobody would listen or offer corporates number never been back since and i highly recommend you go to any other dollar tree or store if possible avoid this one at all cost|had lunch here today and i wont go back we waited  minutes for salad and a half of reuben we ordered sweet potato fries and they came out luke warm sent them back and got the same thing my reuben came and the meat was shredded and falling off the sandwich ive never seen a reuben with meat shredded couldnt even taste it after complaining the manager comped our lunch i still wont go back this was second time that we werent happy with this place|worst pedi polish didnt dry for a hour so toes got messed up when i asked why polish took so long to dry they said that is normal that happens when polish is old what a waste of    i wont be back|customer service needs a lot of work|my family lives in lv and loves this place on  i stopped by to get a gift certificate for them for xmas the hostess sent me to the food bar where the lady asked me if i wanted a menu i told her no thank you but i would like to buy a  gift certi waited for a full  minutes before going back to the hostess and asking if there was somebody else that could help me the hostess went back to the same lady behind the food bar they both looked at me and the hostess went back to the frontafter another  minutes i again asked the food bar lady if i could get the certificate she said oh you want a gift certificate after another  minutes she came back and told me the computers were down and i should come back laterfood may be good but the service at least by the food bar server was horrible|yet another catastrophe dealing with this home warranty they refused to assign another vendor to install a new water heater in a timely manner and would only send expert mechanical upon researching online i found out expert mechanical and this home warranty are owned by the same person major conflict of interest and unethical i will be filing a complaint with the registrar of contractors for deceptive practices and possible fraud|i would never recommend the sales person sean his measurements on our kitchen cabinets were off by  inches and the cabinet is missing the back wall by  inches he made an outlandish statement to my face that some cabinets are made like that and we probably never noticed it like that on our other cabinets i call bull crap on that one it is short  inches on the wall because you screwed up your measurements it takes a man to own up to your mistakes and not make excuses like you did at my house that day i am waiting for the owner to make this right and to make sure that sean never makes excuses to the customers again for taking wrong measurements this is a direct reflection on superiors reputation with this salesman|i love starbucks but this has to be the slowest one around hate that this location is my closest|beware the manager robert is the biggest loser out there he brags about how much money he makes to his customers amazing how att would have a guy like this run a store my dad is a general store manager of a nissan store and robert continually bragged about how much more money he makes then my dad then get this he kicked out an  year old lady because she was upset about her phone bill going up   ridiculous lied to us about the payoff on the phone saying it was  when it was only   my dad said we could go to a different store if he was going to talk to us like that and he said yeah maybe you should because we are all out of phones and told us to leave and go to gilbert and german btw have the best friendly service there highly recommended not going to this store if you do be prepared to be screwed over|waiting  days for eyeglasses is unacceptable  the staff isnt professional and never even called to say there would be a delay  looking for new dr and place to get glasses for my kids  needs new management and front desk training|im going to leave my review at one star until i am satisfied not sure how they can achieve that but ill give them a chancei bought an engagement ring her wedding ring and my wedding ring hereher engagement ring crown was very sharp so i took it back to be polished down she woke up the next morning with a cut on her arm i took it

with my insurance company anyways they substituted with a similar ring i never said to do that now i have to take another day and drive all the way over there again to get this right this will be trip  by the way trip  will be to pick that up trip  will be when her crown arrives trip  will ve picking up the ring i can only see trip  coming all i can say is i told you so i didnt want to go here she did because her coworker did who i might add had the same issues so why did we go i have no clue fix my issues and ill redo this whole rating if it was up to me id buy two basic stylish rings and a trip to australia but noooooo lets put a harley davidson on your finger whatever makes you happy i guess|this has to be the worst walgreens ive ever had to do business with  the staff and management are so unprofessional  ive overheard very unprofessional conversations by staff and the manager acts more like a high school friend with these girls than a professional mentor  they need a new manager and staff  such a shame this store is so unprofessional|the people in this location are rude and unfriendly especialy the heavy set woman that has the name tag that says she is the manager   sorry to bother you to do your job  but what does fed ex care they are big enough to to care   if i was you i would use the us postal service   at least it is cheaper there|i had high hopes as i walked through the door as it looked nicer than most strip mall nail salons wrong my gel manicure is awful my tech rushed and missed spots the polish didnt cure so my nails are already scratched and dented i tipped more than  i guess im just too nice and my tech didnt even say thank you rude|okay before i start i am not racist my favorite type of food is mexican food and i am mexican so this is not influenced by racism i got food here for both breakfast and dinner and both were not pleasant for breakfast my family and i ordered some burritos at the drivethru but the star of this story was the bacon and egg burrito we specified that the burrito be bacon and egg yet when we got burritos they were steak and egg my mom told the lady their mistake and she said that they would fix it we were given back the burritos and headed home once home i took a bite of the burrito and it was steakagain we went back and had them fix the order and they did however the burritos were filled with bacon as if they were thinking you want bacon heres baconas for dinner we ate inside the restaurant and ordered some shredded beef tacos the tacos were okay but they were overflowing with cheese and lettuce while there was barely any meat at all one taco only had meat in the middle also the shell had air bubbles lastly the tvs have mexican channels that rated x i am not going to go into to detail but most of the things have to do with not age appropriate things overall this was not a good experience and if i want mexican food i am going somewhere else|ordered this after  midnight asked for pepperoni with extra sauce and chicken fingers the order was expected to be delivered in  min it took  that was the only positive part of our experience the fingers were dry and burnt i mean black on one side not just overcooked the pizza is horrible barely any toppings spongy crust i will never order from them again disgusting not worth it|not worth the savings while the people who work there were nice and the shuttle picked us up as expected we were not happy with the process of getting the actual car we found fox from the southwest airlines website and expected this to be a decent option however it is not we chose them because the price to rent an expedition was much lower than the other big chains we paid in advance once we got to the counter to pickup the car nothing was mentioned about not having an expedition and finding a suitable alternativeinstead they said thank you and sent us to the lot once in the lot we were told they didnt have an expedition and didnt know when theyd have one but that we could come back anytime to see if one was available hmmm noso now we are to pick anything on the lot is yours and the lot was really only  full seriously really so we took one of the leftover minvans that would fit our whole group its fine but doesnt have any of the basics you expect today from a rental car  usb chargers blue tooth capabilities etc and it hadnt been vaccumedto top it off we had to wait to get someone to let us off the lot they didnt have a gate person sighso the manager who seemed to be doing everything came running over after a  minute wait to let us out never again not worth the money we saved hopefully the return process goes a bit smoother than the checkin|this place is about as bad as it gets i think almost every thing the offer is old or spoiledsay no to this place|went to lms because my  coworkers went there to get  of their cars tinted at a great price  windows for  cant go wrong so i decided to take my truck to get some hids installed well after picking up the truck and taking it home i noticed the installer did some shady work i originally just bought a really harness and some hids but couldnt get them to work thats why i had these guys do the work but the installer just cut through all my wires from my relay harness and my hids and left all the wires still attached to the truck he didnt take the time and removing them he also left cut zip ties in there as well what pissed me off the most is he broke  of my plastic rivots from my truck so now i have to go to the dealership and order  of them because the ones they only have are aftermarket that wont match up they did drop the price like  but i would of liked the job done right the st time its not about the money its about someone doing quality work since your paying for it i knew i should of not let them do the job when i was sitting next to an older man in the waiting room that said he brought his truck to them  times in  months for a fog light they installed and keeps burning out that was my st mistake o well you live and learn u get what u pay for sometimes|i wish i could give zero stars we had to reschedule a trip due to a death and oh my gosh dealing with them was more painful than a fork in the eye after hours on hold and more aggravation than i can possibly convey my flight is still not rescheduled i would advise anyone to not use expedia they are ridiculous to deal with|their prices and selection of stuff isnt bad the customer service was short and unfocused i was unable to get information on what stones were i went to buy an ipad air it wasnt charged hadnt been wiped clean of the previous owners fingerprints and grime or information it took two techs to figure out what the standard password was which should be the same for all the pads in the case and  minutes to charge and get it ready there was a general sense of grunginess to the place|i will start by saying that for me this is the best high rise to live in in las vegas  everyone has different wants and needs but i am very happy with the location the personnel and amenities at panorama towers  the personnel alone should get  starswhy the  stars  just like turnberry towers veer ogden sky allure and martin  the damn developers sold too many units to investors for rentals  i would guess based on personal experiences at two developments that at least  of all of these high rises are rentals  i dont want to get into the math for buying versus rentingbut for the people who purchase having a unit in a building full of other owners makes for a better environment for everyoneif any investors read thiseither sell the units you have or jack up the rents by at least double  there should be no reason why the rent on a  bedroom high rise right near the strip is month  it should be at least   that would not only help your bottom line but also improve the quality of life for the people who actually purchased a unit and lives in it weed out cheap skates  or if you want to sell the unit increase the prices  no  bedroom condo should go for under   period  after they raise the rents or sell at the correct prices i will wholeheartedly give  stars to this complex |so its finally

the customer representative promised me that the move will be completed two days later on tuesday then i received two emails one stating the moving date is on tuesday and the other on thursday i was confused i called the company their automated answering machine sucks also they had to put me through  different persons to tell me that they cannot complete the move until thursday i was pissed off

should know that it is a federal law about taking advantage of the disabled and elderly they just want to sell items to jack up the bill how dishonest of them watch out for this puurfect service is

food itself was pretty disappointing i ordered the miso soup pennsylvania sushi and orange chicken miso soup was extremely salty the pennsylvania roll has raw fish in it even though it wasnt specified on the menu orange chicken was also a little too salty and wayyyy too hard the pieces were too big as well and there was barely any broccoli needless to say i aint going back dont waste your time eating here|this is one of the only affordablypriced options in the monte carloariavdarabellagio area the service is very pleasant and the beer selection is great but the food is barely acceptable between us we had the tuna poke ploughmans platter slider burgers and chicken pot pie  the tuna was stringy and far below what youd call sushi quality  the ploughmans platter featured supermarket salami and cubed cheese off a hotel banquet cheese platter  the sliders were ordered medium they may have been medium once on their way to being hockey pucks the chicken pot pie featured microscopic bits of chicken with cubes of undercooked potatoes and a shower of birdseye frozen mixed vegetables which seemed to have been heated only by the gloppy tasteless sauce  oh and the loud heavy metal music didnt help matters|just called to make a special birthday celebration reservation the ladies whom answer the phones need more training their phone systems were messed up i was hung up on twice

 min wait   the good chill vibe and atmosphere the clientele seems used to the long wait  people in line and dim lighting the bad  people in line lighting as if im getting my freak on and i waited about  mins to place my order as nobody was at the register  after placing my order i went to the bathroom to my dismay there was trash all over the floor a dirty bathroom with a sponge laying next to the toilet and smeared mirrors i felt the walls sinking in so i escaped only to find the kitchen with food all over the floor and dirty dishes everywhere my food was med warm to go   and very dry meat

used wolff on three prior homes we have owned and after dealing with christine we will not return in any way shape or form  she is incredibly rude and does not have the customers needs at heart  i was shocked at her unprofessional manner  we are going somewhere else for service and purchasing a new ac unit|worst bottle service ever no one served us they gave us a table all the way in the back so far away from the stage that the music sounded like it was playing from my iphone it was also waaay too bright in the patio area where our table was like seriously its a night club turn off the lights and we tried to order a second round of bottle service despite the horrible service and they literally took an hour to bring something out theres a reason why this club is almost irrelevant and now i know why go to light or hakkasan instead way better serviceclub scene|holiday period yet only one register open  not the cashiers fault but this doesnt look like a well managed sears store looks

the next  years die quietly inside again|just ate here with  buddies and what a disappointment   when the server finally arrived at our table and was asked about a beer he said only that he doesnt drink beer because hes diabetic   no criticism for the medical condition but why would he be a server at a place that markets itself as a beer spot if he cant come up with a more helpful response  this server went on to be slow at almost everything  after  minutes we had to ask where our burgers were  he said hed check and then he came out with them  the fries were cold the burgers cooked past medium and one buffalo burger was unrecognizable as suchthe bathroom was a wreckhand towel dispensers are broken so theres just a roll of paper slowly but surely wicking water spilled from the sinksoverall the service was slow and inaccurate the food was mediocre and the atmosphere is in steep decline   no way im coming back here|extremely over price for the quality of food pasta was dry and my guest and i were very disappointed  i do not recommend this place i wish they had s better food selection|american airlines is a disaster from my experience they have definitely cut corners to

is all lacking every time i go through the drive thru they mess something up and always walk away before i can say anything  i went a while ago and they handed me my iced tea and it was filled  from the top when i asked for more when i finally flagged somebody down and they told me there are no refills and i explained no you guys handed it to me like this she was clearly annoyed with me another time their scanner was broken and when i held up my phone the girl was clearly annoyed and informed me that if i wanted to use my card or coupon on my phone she would have to manually enter itand then just stared at me went yesterday and sat waiting for  minutes begins  car for my iced tea my husband ran in the other week and they had to remake his and another patrons drinks not once but twice because they kept mixing them up between the types and hotcold unfortunately its the most convenient location around me and i had already added money to my dunkin card so i had to finish it off the only thing that brought me back yesterday was the free drinknot worth it|inconsistent pizza quality and too cool staff to acknowledge poor service such as saying pickup pie will be ready in  minutes and it takes more than  bad combination|read this before purchasing a certified lexusif you think that your lexus you have been purchased as certified is like a new car warranty  not at all dont let lexus sales rep mislead you like they mislead us the certified warranty will require from you to bring the car and pay  for each diagnose yes  not like you are having a new car that its free and hold oneven if the part is coverd under that warranty they will still charge you for new boltsscrews and all that yes yes your eyes can read they will charge you for bolts this is a major mislead over there and ill post my story in every possible medialexus used to be number  in customer service but no more its all about the money and its all about their sales rep bonuses |the customer service here is horrible if i dint have to ever come here i wouldnt i couldnt get a champurrado in the champurrado line if my life depended on it after waiting at least  minutes in line not to mention someone else is waiting in another ridiculous long line to cout its christmas time ppl open up all the fucking lines  get some people to work that have a clue|cashiers are trying hard and i appreciate people that try hard but there are some very disappointing things about this eleven frequently out of condiments for hot dogs  any and all including but not limited to onion sauerkraut jalapenos  cheese machine is empty one out of for times i get nachos why is there constantly  people standing in line all the timeugh|its a cool idea  a higher end buffet filled with specialty cuisine for the foodie crowd however when i went i was totally disappointed the portions of plated food are all going to be smaller naturally but thats what makes this place annoying i tried almost everything and it all tasted bland such a rip off|seems like the word surrounding marquee is that the bouncers and doormen are the biggest douchebags from my experience this past saturday this could not be more correctmy night started off as a complete disaster thanks to those guys my group and i got in the guestlist line by  we reached the front after a longg  minute wait expecting to get in without any problems once we start entering a random girl slips in pretending to be part of the group and runs into the club out of sight realizing the number in our group was off the bouncers prevent me and my friend from entering and force us to get out of line we tried to explain exactly what had just happened but they would not listen at first they assumed we were lying then they started telling us its our duty to make sure that girl didnt cut us right bc that was totally preventable and no thats literally the securitys job as we attempted to explain ourselves more they immediately start cussing us out and yelling at us in front of everybody to leave im a pretty nice guy so one could imagine how unwarranted this reaction really was these doormen would just not have it with us so i approached another bouncer and explained our situation to him he was at least willing to hear us out but basically said you guys got screwed tonight but we cant do anything about it he then tells us that if youre staying at the cosmo hotel you get  free comps and that the hotel guests have a separate line where you dont have to wait nearly as longso we follow his instructions and went to the hotel front desk to make those arrangements they told us that guests do get comped but normally arent allowed in after  theres also no such as a separate hotel guest line so basically the bouncer straight up lied to us to get us out of his face we called the resort manager down who tried to help but couldnt because marquee is a completely outsourced rd party companyas a last resort my friend and i got back in the guest line hoping that maybe theyd let us in if we explained ourselves again at the front after another  min of waiting in line we asked another bouncer for the club manager he was nice enough to explain the situation to him so the manager escorted us to the front where they let us in hallelujah i appreciate the effort of the manager and that bouncer but i cant give this place any more than one star for the cussing yelling and lying my friend and i endured from the doormen for the  hours we tried to get in lets identify the doormen who caused this shall we the man and woman working at the third floor entrance on     pm based on other reviews this disrespect doesnt seem to be an isolated incident at marqueemy experience inside wasnt the greatest either it lacks a large middle dancefloor space seems like only  of attendees can fit into the main pit area if youre trying to dance and go hard to your favorite dj this isnt the place to be for those of us who get in late and arent allowed in the middle you basically spend all your time standingchilling in the outdoor areas where theres space that wasnt so exciting the pit is also the only place where the sound quality is decent disappointing time here not the place ill be returning to next time in vegas|we came here with pretty high expectations but was sadly disappointed in both the service and some of the food items when we got there the hostess was on the phone so another woman came up to the stand im not quite sure why because she just stood there for a few minutes without even acknowledging our existence my boyfriend had to ask her if it would be okay for us to eat there or be seated because quite frankly they looked closed and didnt have single customer in there it was extremely awkward and we felt unwelcomed here are some feedbacks  the bread they served us was burnt im not talking toasty it was actually burnt and was not good at all  the water was poured into a beautiful wine glass it was deceiving because the glass actually smelled like mildew almost like a dirty wet rag smell  we were the only  people in there at  pm when we placed our order a table with a woman who apparently knew the restaurant owner came in a little after and placed her order she got her food first and we didnt get our entrees until   pm my boyfriend ordered the greek salad and i ordered the lamb medium with asparagus it took them so long we were over dinner by the time it came out and had to have it boxed if they were actually busy and had customers we would understand but they didnt they didnt apologize for how long it took either which i thought was entirely rude we over heard the waiter ask someone why our food was taking so long but he never came to us with an explanation the entree itself was okay but our overall experience i would have to give a  star not a friendly environment and not very particular for the price there are a lot better greek restaurants i would prefer over this onehonestly it was just a cold stiff experience the service was awful and we dreaded being there actually nothing about the people who work there make you want to come back we also ordered drinks and two starters and the starters were both dry and bland|a little more then disappointment i double checked the hours online and on facebook before driving almost  mins to find out they were not open hours were  today|love the food hate the customer service my husband and i decided to go there tonight we arrived at  forgetting they closed at pm we debated on leaving but then saw that another couple walked in so we walked in right behind them and saw that other couple was being able to order so we stood in line and waited an older lady stood by the counter and told us they were closed nothing else just we are closed mind you the couple in front of us was still ordering this service left a bad taste in our mouths so if you come here be prepared to be treated badly my suggestion to the business if you are closed then lock your doors|dont fly unitedthey left us stranded in the airport overnightthey had delayed our flight and would not hold our connecting flightwhats worse is they sold out the connecting flight the next day so it was not even an option to take the firstnow were sitting here on a dirty airport floor all night and can not even go to sleep because we have to watch our  bagsthey would not even let us check our bagthat means we could not go through security so no access to gift shops food drink or anythingno offers of hotel stay transportation or any compensation or good will gesture at allnothingplease choose another airline when making your next choice|i have encountered some of the rudest postal staff here hersha truly represented the stereotypical postal worker she was rude discriminatory and unprofessional i try to avoid the counter in general but i can assure you i will never be back to this location you all should be ashamed of how you treat people here|went in to speak to the mobile department terrible customer service and i felt extremely rushed over a few questions i had honestly i wont go back to this location id rather spend money where i dont feel like im wasting an employees time|i am a card carrying member and have never been so disgusted by my treatment anywhere spare yourself do not go|great beerbad advertising all half off after ten is not all beersi got duped into coming in after ten from there all beer half off after ten pm signs all over the restaurant i soon came to find out that certain beers are excluded as explained on small print on the menu classic bait and switch manager was there and completely unapologetic good selection but shady practicescustomer service is everything|cant figure out why this show is so overhyped it probably deserves  stars but i am down voting to correct for the excessive praiseif you like acrobatics just go see a cirque show you will see better stuff in a much more creative presentationmost of the acts in the show were sexual acrobatics  if thats what you want just go to a strip club im not offended easily its just not entertaining seeing the same act again and again|if youre looking for a reliable quote or anyone to perform a patio installation that will follow through for you dont call these people my wife and i walked into their showroom and we requested to have somebody come to the house for an estimation once the gentleman or the representative came to the house he looked things over hes been suggested that hed have to check in regards to the county for permits and such and he would tell us that he would get back with us with an estimation and any permits that we would be required to have well days would pass and i would call finding out what happened to our estimate in the car back and when you speak to the receptionist they dont know of anything of sorts i would leave messages for the representative to call me back never got a call back and i called several times after that and yet nobodys ever bother to call back that lacks professionalism and courtesy fortunately with an experience like that just proves to me that i should not do business with people like that i would also recommend based on my experience that you may want to search for a different company dont fall victim to the lack of customer service and follow through|this needs to treat all customers fairly and not just a few and never prejudge anyone based on skin color that is all|so apparently customer service from this company does not exist i have lost  packages in  months due to their damn freaking laziness i have a fence around my yard and they wont even open a gate and walk up to my actual door and place my packages there no they prefer to just dump them right over the fence which is by a sidewalk on thomas road so if i dont catch them delivering the packages sit out by the fence for anyone walking by to see them and then take them as they please theres also no way to catch one of the damn drivers because by the time they pull up and i see them and go out front they are gone that quick all they do is a freaking dump and run they have no concern to what happens to your package after they toss it out of their truck i would like for them to have this treatment and see how it feels to constantly loose stuff they order because the person delivering doesnt give a fck about the packages i freaking hate this company and wish people would stop using them as carriers|we used to come here before i went to work all the time because it was fast and healthy recently the prices have gone way up and the device has gone down i dont think we will ever come back and thats sad because we used to love this place no one was in the restaurant and the girl refilling the veggies and meat was just standing there and my husband had to wait forever for sliced beef and i had to wait for tomatoes but originally she lied and said they were out|run away from these guysmr michael fenneman claims he runs a business and thats why he charged  for what he stated i just reseted the unit found nothing else wrong verbatim the words used by the prior to reviewers here such as quick honest and competitive pricing didnt come to mind when i used these guys i only write reviews when i can have a positive impact on people but this time i felt compelled to share my experience so nobody has to deal with this problem again|let me start off by saying that i love this place my friends and i always make sure we stop here and load up on awesomeness before we drive home we were excited to hear that they were back open this time  i was in lv celebrating my th bday with about  of my friends and family from around the us saturday night  we left the hotel to hit tacos el gordo there were about  of us we ordered our food paid and continued to seat ourselves mid bite we were approached by the police scared and slightly intimidated he asked us to show our receipts he said that the cashier told him that we did not pay for our food we showed all of our receipts and the officer was apologetic no one else in the restaurant that night was asked to show their receipt why were we targeted my friends and i are all professional women with careers and families at home and of course were very capable of covering  dollar tacos im most disgusted in the attitudes and beliefs displayed by teg staff this night we were never issued an apology or anything we were were racially profiled and it was humiliating embarassing and disgusting|terrible  went in for a  minute massage due to lower back and hip pain radiating down my legs   i explained to the theopist and that this is where i wanted her to focus  well after  minutes of her focusing on my heck upper back and shoulders i asked her to stop because my hips and back were hurting worse  seemed like the therapist had her own agenda and didnt care what i asked her to focus upon  have been here before and the experience was good but doubt that i will be coming back|there were no customers after my order waited  minutes for a mcdouble  not really fast food there  drink station was a mess like it hadnt been checked  a spilled drink on the floor waiting for a lawsuit  go elsewhere|we used to eat here all the time so we decided to have my daughters th birthday here her and  of her friends came for lunch my daughter is a vegetarian so we always get the kids bento box with steamed tofu instead of chicken or steak well today they said they couldnt do it when i asked why they said that there is no button in their computer to ring it in are you kidding me chicken bento sub tofu its as easy as that being in scottsdale with all the competition youd think theyd be much more accommodating i spoke to a manager and she called the owner the owner said he would do it this one time but i quote never ever again so i guess we will not be eating here ever again he would rather lose a good customer than swap chicken for tofu so ridiculous and very bad businessi am so disgusted furthermore because of this debacle the kids food took forever and kinda ruined the mood of the party thanks a lot stingray very disappointed i have been in the restaurant industry for years and worked for several different establishments and never would any of the places i worked for be so unaccommodating and rude|i decided to give this place a try since it seemed to be overhyped by many students and classmateseverything here tasted of salt it was all i could taste i had the tacos and tlacoyo the meat did not seem fresh and the cheese tasted processedits your standard run of the mill mexican restaurant but ive definitely experienced better|really unsatisfied the music was so loud i couldnt think or hear what people were saying ended up getting a headache also the staff here were so rude they told me to wait while they finished texting on there phone|if i had a friend in this business i would have been warned to stay far away from here i can honestly say this was the worse experience that i have ever had anywhere their lack of customer service in all aspects left me my spouse and my mother with a broken back with no mattress sets we purchased a full size mattress and box spring a queen size mattress and box spring and a bedframe on december   we set delivery up for december  due to a medical emergency with my mother we needed to cancel our delivery on december  and were assured by phone that it was not a problem and we set a new delivery date for december  we put our old mattresses and box springs out for bulk pickup that morning after not receiving a time for delivery my spouse called and found out that we were not in the system for delivery confused and desperate he expressed that we did have an appointment for that day and that we were most concerned for my mother and her needing a bed they decided to grill my spouse about who he spoke to they stated whoever it was will be held accountable because every employee is a shareholder in this family run business my husband uncertain of who it was and trying to focus on the problem and a resolution asked if there was any way they could fix their mistake the answer was no because they had  items to deliver and they would not be able to budge it was wonderful to become a number and for them to have no accountability for their mistake frustrated my spouse asked to speak with corporate they gave us jim at the warehouse jim was apologetic and said he would get them out first stop the next day because my husband had to be somewhere at noon and they made a mistake i slept on a couch my spouse an air mattress and my mother a chair because nothing we had worked for her back problem we receive a call at a quarter to nine the next morning and we were given a different time frame and the delivery men said they could not change that and that they just finished loading the truck and we were not the first stop my husband called jim and he said he would fix it and that he did  product arrives and what a mess the delivery men were asked to only build the frame and my spouse and i would place the mattresses and box springs on the beds they did do that but the bedframe was a disaster it was going to wreck a brand new box spring something was wrong my spouse called the manager and the manager emailed pics as to what the bedframe should look like and stated that the metal clips should be at a  degree angle and ours appeared defective in the pic he received he offered to go to the warehouse and get a new one and build it and also help put the mattresses and box springs on big mistake once here with a out of the box new bedframe he claimed ours looked fine and it will not damage the box springs well no surprise but it did then he justified it by saying his did that too and that its under warranty and we could get a new one if we did not like the products at all we just need to keep the plastic and return it then poof he was gone once i looked at the queen mattress i realized the bed was in horrible shape it was pulled and ripped in many spots along the piping thinking it was a accidental defect i went and looked at the other mattress and found it in the same condition unbelievable where do their products come from frustrated my spouse decided to call the owner of the company and all i can say is wow unprofessional is the name of the game he put the manager of the store on three way and the owner started to argue with my spouse to the point he got uncomfortable and handed me the phone the manager told untruths as to the hole in box spring and would not own up to what happened then the owner asked the manager if the mattress was damaged and he said no very irritated that i was being accused of damaging the mattress exaggerating or both i expressed my concern about their ability to provide quality products and what i felt they were saying they would not say that that is not what they were saying therefore making it seem they were blaming me for the mattresses the owner told me to take my business elsewhere and that he would not offer an apology or new non defective mattresses they would pick the mattress up hopefully today and have a nice day this is a small summary as to what happened and customers need to understand that if you show you will not be deceived ignore problems in order to keep product out of desperation or that you will not take kindly to being accused of damaging a product within ten seconds of having it andor exaggerating than your result will be the same as mine i guess if you expect customer service you are a horrible nasty customer dont bother the next generation business owner because in my opinion he does not seem to understand what that title requires power not business ethics runs this business|this place is horrible i ordered from eat they billed my card but i never got my order no delivery no call from the restaurant i tried to call and the phone just rings and rings worst place ever dont order from here now i gotta call the bank and eat  to see how i get my money back|very meh my wife and i ordered out and got the yelp deal we were looking for pizza and wings and since this place had good reviews and a deal we figured why notwell the experience was very underwhelming we got wings and fries and upgraded them to greek fries we got a pizza with a bunch of toppings though i dont remember exactly what it waswhen we got there it was dead empty which i thought wasnt a great sign since it was around dinner time we got the food struggled a bit with redeeming the yelp deal and went homefor some reason whoever made the wings and fries decided to throw them both together in a closed styrofoam to go box even though it was  minutes back to our apartment by the time we got there the fries were the mushiest thing ive ever experienced also the greek aspect was almost non existent the wings were also mushy and not very flavorfulat this point i was disappointed but i figured whatever its take out fries hopefully the pizza is good well it was alright its hard for me to not feel like pizza is very tasty i mean its bread cheese garlic sauce how bad could it get this wasnt bad but it also wasnt good i felt very meh about it which is unusual for me and pizzaoverall we wont be back as our money is better spend elsewhere for italian take out|okay so where do i start audrey and james are both super nice audrey is outgoing and fun james came off as creepy at first but was cool i guess i went to about  laser treatments for under my arms now let me mention that ive had laser done under my arms before by another clinic  months before starting with audrey she was friendly and made me comfortable she used the laser with gel old school machines the machine was never charged enough and she never did touched my skin now ive had laser done before and sometimes u got a stretch the skin

difference she told me that im her only customer to say this really the only one this place just sucks they have the oldest machines and although they are nice they so not know how to laser body parts please dont waste your money like i did you will not see a difference what so ever they just bullshit everything i just stopped going i never even got a call back asking why im not going to my appointments or if i would like to reschedule i didnt even want my money back i just wanted to stay away from this low budget place dont waste your money here|absolutely the worst theater experience ever the website does not inform you youll be sitting in what is basically an office chair from costco completely inappropriate for a child when i questioned this with a manager jason i was greeted with sarcasm and disinterest too many other great choices for theaters in our area to settle for this type of nonsense go somewhere else at least the wait staff is super helpful obviously not taking their lead from the so called management|dont go here im a sushi addict and have been to several sushi restaurants in the valley sakana sushi being my all time favorite this place puts no effort in making their sushi rolls and they are too expensive for how tiny they are youd have to spend at least  to get full off of sushi rolls here|i was disappointed with my experience here and would not go back again medusa had come recommended by a couple of friends however i found my stylist didnt listen to what i wanted and instead pushed a style she wanted eventually i came away with the haircut i was after but it felt like i was arguing half the time and it was a million miles away from relaxingalso had cut marks left on my neck from using a hair trimmer without a guard|overpriced and not as knowledgeable as they should be with certain manufacturers  mis diagnosed and ended up paying thousands for nothing  do not recommend|if i could give zero stars i would ive been waiting  hours for some soup and an order of shrimp rangoons  the lady on the phone keeps saying i live far and thats the reason they are now closed and i have yet to receive my order what the fuck i will never order here again|me and my girls went there on sunday after church we order salads and the zucchini fries as appetizer i have never tasted season less food like i had there this wasnt a great place for me the service saved the food|this texan says never again i requested lean brisket it had more fat than regular brisket from other places the taste was good but not great the beans corn and garlic potatoes were also good but nothing special the jalapeo cornbread was too dense and bland to finish things off i had peach cobblertheworstever i actually spit it out  never going here again|i do not make a habit of writing negative reviews unless the business truly warrants one  in this case i feel obligated to share my experience with grayhawk medical group this review is not intended to deter you from visiting the business but to share my personal experience only you can make your own determinationi was looking for a new doctor for my yearly physical exam and dr nuez was recommended to me by a nurse practitioner i met at a cvs minute clinic i called the office and was treated very professionally over the phone i was given an appointment within a couple of days of my call i went to my appointment on december th  sat down to fill out some initial paperwork and was attended to by the front office staff in a very warm and professional mannerno complaints at all i went into the exam room and was initially attended to by rosa dr nuezs nurse she was also very professional did the typical blood pressure check weight check etc dr nuez came in shortly after we discussed my history talked about my overall health also some recent concerns about indigestion reflux palpitations stress etc dr nuez proceeded to perform some run of the mill checkslistened to my heart and lungs stuck a tongue depressor in my mouth to look at my throat etc  that was about it with the exception of some additional conversation regarding the above mentioned symptoms i had been presenting prior to the visit dr nuez recommended an ekgecg and a blood draw which were done right away after the ekgecg results were available dr nuez came back into to discuss the results with me which appeared to be normal we discussed the predictable outcome of my blood tests how best to manage an expected out of range cholesterol result a little more about my history on crestor some other symptoms such as foot neuropathy and so on that was the summary of events i left the exam room discussed payments and expected communication with the front desk then went on my merry way  this was all on a tuesday i was told that lab results could take anywhere from a week to two weeks to come back that was a little strange to me i have had blood drawn dozens of times over the last  years and typically most doctors call win  hours with results as a matter of fact i have never not had the actual doctor call me to discuss test results i was told that my results would be posted on their online portal along with any communications two days after the visit i was still having some stomach issues and sent a message through the portal to the doctor as instructed asking if maybe he would consider an antibiotic for my stomach issues  i never heard back  i did get the test results in better time then what i was told i was notified by the portal on december th that my results were in i immediately went to look at the results knowing that my cholesterol related numbers would be out of range by a mile as predicted and discussed a with dr nuez during my visit at this point i had expected to hear from the doctor to discuss going back on crestor i waited and waited and never heard anything i decided to call on december th and was told that someone would get back to me on december th i was contacted by rosa the nurse it was undetermined what course of action would need to be taken and she said she would send a message to the doctor via the portal as he was working from home that day she said he may or may not get back right away as he was at home and she was not sure he would check his messages today december nd i still have not heard from the doctor no determination as to how to treat my cholesterol no communication via telephone or the portal  at this point i have made the determination that i am not an important patient for this practice i do not know why as they were very professional during the scheduling process and initial appointment however the followup after the appointment and test results is nothing short of abominable in my opinion  i have seen many doctors over the years as i have lived all over the country and have had to change because of relocations however i have never experienced this type of delayed followup this is not what i expect from my doctor hence will not be returning to this practice again dr nuez seems like a nice guy and professional his office staff the same communication skills are horrible in regards to followup and in my opinion this is critical to good treatment end of story|not that great food missing taste and presentation service is slow a bit sloppy and pricy for what it really is week days and  weekendsbeen here tried it next |after seeing this chiropractor several times i did not feel at all confident with him first of all i went to him for low back pain and he xrayed my neck and not my lower back he showed me an xray supposedly of my neck which i have come to find out was not my neck at all but yet he charged me for an xray i think he scammed me also my lower back never did feel much better after over a month of sessions|concierge desk was not so helpful|ate there tonight with my family and it was very disappointing portions are very small service was ok but we waited over an hour for our food i ordered meatloaf and pork shoulder the meatloaf was bland covered with no taste gravy while the pork shoulder was decent my son ordered a vietnamese sandwich that was absolutely horrible he also ordered the vladimir putin fries which was probably one of the worst things ive ever ate my life some of this food tasted like it was frozen stouffers food at the local giant eagle i would never come back nor recommend it to anybody i would rather eat a bologna sandwich with ketchup in the monkey exhibit at the zoo while somebody through monkey biscuits at me wow the monkeys pick their nose and laughed at me|a disappointment for sure i came in with my daughters expecting to be able to find some sweet treats  hot cocoa for them  an adult beverage for me after seeing the nutcracker ballet across the street there was an incredible line they were out of hot chocolate and many of their dessert offerings to enjoy your treats you have to just sit in the hotel lobby  maybe i should have done more research but i expected to find something a little higher end and certainly more wellrun since its associated with ritz carlton|think twice before heading here for lunch and getting their quattro special  the portions are meniscal  there could not have been  worth of food on the plate  i only wish i took a picture for all to see  if anyone dares to order this please take a pic and post it  if you use a decent camera it should be able to pick up the food on the plate  they should be embarrassed|my wife went into the store to make a purchase apparently they dont take cash try to give them  bill lame|i am a pet sitter and recently had to do a pet taxi service here for a client and was highly disappointed with my visit for her dog the receptionist was awkward and fake the lvt was an airhead and the dr was very charming with his british accent until the moment i denied him trying to sell me a  vaccine after explaining i was just the pet sitter not the owner then he started to be rude and literally shooed me out of the room   not my dog  so im not paying for it  she doesnt need this shot as we live in vegas its just a vaccination banfield gives to make more   i might be a little biased since i also work part time at a veterinary clinic but still im the pet sitter why are you trying to sell me a  vaccine when i specifically already said i was just the damn pet sitter  that should have been clue  doctor and you dont need to be rude to me because i said no im not the owner if you need to provide terrible customer service do it to her not the messenger do i need to return not for myself will i return only for clients who dont want to come see my vet who wont get mad at a pet sitter for saying no when its the owners decision hah|it does not surprise me one bit they went out of business they were super nice when i bought a gun from them i took the gun the same week out to the range and it jammed because it was defective i called them and they straight blew me off wtf i had to call the manufacturer  who told me to call them all in all the manufacturer fixed it but that was some bs  they told me to take it to a gun smith after i just bought it like i said doesnt surprise me|i would never take my dog to the groomers here again with spending over  on grooming you would expect nothing but great service within a a day or two my dog started having a horrible itch on the back of her tailbutt within a week of her being groomed at petsmart it kept on getting worse and worse she was making her tail and butt area skin raw because she was getting so irritated i had to take her to the vet right away and she got fleas and a really bad hot spot it costed me almost  to get her taken care of at the vetthe tech who groomed my dog didnt even check my rabies shot records even though i had it with me and didnt ask me anything about my dog being groomed before i gave her my dog i knew it was a red flag and should of cancelled the appt it is really upsetting that a grooming location especially a huge company doesnt check the animals ahead of time especially for something so contagious and can cause huge issues i now have to watch my dogs feces all day to make sure she doesnt get worms all because of taking her to the groomers at petsmart i still have the receipt and notes from the vet and would like petsmart to reimburse me for the vet bill since my dog has suffered since receiving grooming from petsmart|big grove is another one of those new american restaurants which seems to charge more for the vibe than for quality of foodon my first trip during dinner i had a burger a standard burger which i could have gotten for cheaper and quicker at somewhere like courier the meat was highly overcooked tough and chewy despite ordering it medium rare my friend had a risotto which just looked like mush on the plate both of our food came lukewarm it was a quite busy night im guessing and the food sat out waiting to be taken  but any proper restaurant would manage betterwhen i went for lunch i had a steak sandwich  again with the toughness of the meat and a slightly stale bread this time by the time i finished eating my jaw was sore as if it had done some bench pressingim giving  stars because of their poutine available on friday and saturday evenings after pm it makes for amazing postbars food maybe since you are not really caring about quality as much|this place is not a good meal option  my jaw is sore from eating the leather sandwich  they call it a steak sandwich but i know leather when i taste it  good thing it came with mushy french fries to give my over worked jaw a rest  why  stars  first hop drop and roll on draft  very good  secondly good music  only option to sit down and eat in terminal a  united please fly out of another terminal|i will never use this service again i understand why they are getting blown out of the water by services like uber and lyft i ordered a cab an entire two hours early so i would not be late for my flight the arrival time was set for  am at  i called to find out where the driver was located and they told me i was not even in the system at that point they resent out another driver who then contacted me  minutes later to let me know he was in route and would be to me within  to  minutes after an additional   minutes with no arrival i tried contacting the driver whos phone was turned off i was beyond frustrated at that point but i kept my cool and called discount once again they informed me that they did not know what happened to the driver who had been in route but they were going to send out someone for a third time keep in mind it was now  am when i originally needed the arrival to be at am i let them know that i was in a extreme time crunch at this point because of my flight back to michigan and they said unfortunately things like this have been happening on a regular basis and they were not willing to do anything to rectify the situation but send out another driver i then asked if they would be willing to at least cover a portion of the fair which they would not do and the representative stated the only thing they would be willing to do is send me out   voucher for another ride in the future which i would not receive for another  to  weeks in the maili declined  because of their lack of professionalism i missed my flight and had to pay an additional  to reschedule to the next available flight on another airline i decided to not even take discount and it went to my neighbor offered him   to take me to the airport which was only  minutes away i wish i could give them less than one star i will never use this service again nor recommend it to anyone save your money and use it uber  or lyft i know uber is only  a mile compared to the  that discount charges plus they do not except tips and cars are always in perfect condition with trustworthy drivers|i wasnt a huge fan of the pizza here i was expecting a lot more considering their tag line is fresh fire roasted if the pizza is fire roasted i couldnt tell we ordered the sweet sauce pizza wishfully thinking it might be a nice alternative to my favorite pie from fioris unfortunately the city ovens pizza reminded me of something youd find in the freezer aisle of the grocery store  although i didnt like the pizza i would be willing to give this place another chance and try their other menu items|i didnt had a appointment but called the shop before i walked in and they said its fine and that somebody would take care of me soon i was waiting for min before i left and nobody said shit|lost  articles of clothing over a month and a half periodwhen asked how do we go about finding the missing items i was told no solutionthe reason they have low prices  they offer poor work  poor customer servicesome advice on where to go instead is carriage cleaners  they barcode your items so the no solution line is impossible to use|whats the point in priding your selves on being able to make a sandwich freaky fast when you cant get a one sandwich order right|i never want to say any negative but this place doesnt worth the money the price and the food quality are totally opposite it is wayyy too expensive for low quality food  i would give it no star|been here a few times es before  my rule of thumb is give a place  chances before rating them  i have eaten at many  filibertos in my life and generally they are good with huge burritos and dont usually skimp on the ingredients  this one however skips on everything and charges  tax not included for a carnes ada burrito w cheeses and sour cream only  they are tiny  the size in comparison to other filibertos that i have eaten at  today was the topper when i got another tiny carnes asada burrito again  it must be management being super cheap and rationing the burrito fillings here but three strikes and your out  i will literally cross the street and get a bigger better tasting burrito next time|typical unscrupulous repair shop after taking my  over for a diagnostic they came up with a laundry list of erroneous problems on top of that the owner todd not only lied to a potential buyer about my porsche he denied ever interacting with the buyer avoid trophy at all costs the positive posts are undoubtedly fake please be advised|worst gym establishment in arizona first they allowed my ex wife to link my bank account to her membership without my permission costing me hundreds of dollars and even after acknowledging this they wouldnt cancel without her permission and never refunded me a dime i went in on november th to cancel my membership payed the fee and was charged my monthly fee again on the th after telling them that my membership was never cancelled and am still being charged all they can say is that they are sorry but they cant do anything about it because i didnt keep my copy of the cancelation form i am about to get charged in a week and they are being extremely difficult to work with i wouldnt recommend this place to my worst enemy people beware take your business elsewhere|we used to go to this restaurant once a week for takeout this was our goto restaurant we loved this place however  they have either really gone down hill or changed managers our food has been old cold dry and tasteless and we live a half  mile away after several failed tries hoping it was just a couple of mistakes we realize its not so we are now hoping you are made aware that your takeout customers matter and that you adjust accordingly|overall if you are just looking for a place to send your kids because you work and they need daycare then this is a fine choice and better than many of the alternatives if you are coming here looking for an authentic montessori environment and sought this school out intentionally for those reasons i would recommend looking elsewhere  and would suggest looking up ami or ams certified schools creo is one if you want a recommendation spondeo is not certified additionally many of the issues i mention below are specific to the toddler classroom and we actually experienced even just in passing much better teachers in the older classrooms so if you have an older child this school may be great for you  let me start this by saying we are a family that incorporates montessori philosophy into our house since birth so we are very familiar with it and were most drawn to the respect given to the child and emphasis on grace and courtesy normally seen in a montessori classroom having come from a certified school prior to moving here we had high expectations for spondeo unfortunately we were disappointed immediately our son was in the toddler room and many things jumped out at us as areas for improvement teachers did not communicate with parents at pick up  when having a child under  i would still like something of a daily report even if its just a it was a good day this was especially concerning when my child came home with a bloody nose and no one could explain it when brought to the staffs attention we were told they were supposed to be filling out a daily paper which they did finally start doing on occasion but it simply had ate well or didnt eat much circled so not helpful  on that note our son came home with almost his entire lunch uneaten nearly every day fortunately he was in half days so we immediately fed him upon bringing him home and he ate almost all of it as soon as he got home so i doubt it was an appetite issue this was concerning since we were considering full days  would they really let a  year old go all day without eating it bothered us that no one seemed concerned about this or even mentioned his lack of eating which made me wonder if they were even paying attention  as many know montessori is about fostering independence in the child while diligently observing and creating a prepared environment in a place like spondeo that gets exploited by the instructors to mean chat in a group while letting the toddlers run free with no supervision i witnessed this on several occasions particularly during the outdoor time where i frequently saw all  teachers chatting with backs to the children maybe this is common but during more than one occasion i saw children throwing rocks into each others faces and the teachers only noticed once an injured child was screaming i doubt the parents of those kids would have been happy to witness that  the classroom was montessori in appearance only but not in practice school for our toddler was optional so we made the choice to send him because we expected it to reinforce the practices we had at home we emphasized grace courtesy respect and care for others and the environment and expected a paid program to do the same upon picking him up early one day i had a chance to observe some of the classroom time and immediately cringed when i heard the instructor rudely chastising a child from across the room by repeating herself at least a dozen times again not a huge deal for your everyday daycare but frustrating in an environment that is supposed to show respect for the child and teach manners  if you wouldnt talk to a peer that way then dont do it to the kids many other things in the classroom were lacking as well such as serving their own food or drinks and washing dishes  basically all the practical life activities that can be messy and inconvenient for the instructors  the teachers in the toddler room seemed to genuinely dislike their jobs in the short time we were there they lost  teachers which meant a lot of change for the kids none of them really seemed to enjoy interacting with the children nor did they make any effort to build relationships with them  they have a serious mosquito problem and our son came home with over  bites  the uniforms seem like overkill in the toddler room and are just a way to nickel and dime parentsfinally the owner judy was very defensive when we tried to discuss some of these issues with her and immediately dismissed any problems she is definitely the personality of the place and knows how to charm incoming parents but seemed ultimately concerned more about business than fixing problems or having an authentic montessori environment ultimately we pulled our son out because this school was just missing what we were looking for and we are glad we did and our child has been better since leaving there|came because of reviews and the yelp promo was going to order crepes from their menu but they dont make that anymore ordered eclair nutella truffle cake and pecan cake everything is dry chewy and old taste dont seem fresh disappointed|sold an item on ebay and shipped it next day however paypal is holding my money they say they will release the money  days after  buyer receives the item once its released transferring the money to my bank account takes another  days looks like if i keep using paypal it will take  days till i access my money and i am paying transaction fee for all this bsthey talk about credibility of the account holder etc i have been using ebay and paypal for  years what credibility you are talking about i have thousands of transactions so farthey say it happens randomly in some transactions it happened to me twice in a row dear paypal if you need money go to a financial institution and ask for a loan stop putting a hold on paypal users money there is no free money shame on you what a stupid business model you have|i went there last night the hostess was very unfriendly she looks like she was pissed at the world the burritos were ok but we asked for chorus on the end of our meal they were not even cooked i will definitely  be going extra mile to filabertos next time i hope owner does something about it i used to love this place but never again|if you miss a payment that really should have been insurance covered they  quickly turn you over to collection without notice be very careful of this companythen when you call they are very rude i was told they do not have the staff to contact people who owe on accounts   based upon this service and the wait times in their clinics they are very understaffed|positives first  guac is great  music was awful and way too loud  i asked if they could please turn it down to which they replied  no  but ill check with manager corporate office sets the volume level  they didnt turn it down   second  the apparent manager was rude and rushed  seemed irritated that we were there  i will never eat here again  chipotle is near by  and food and vibe is  percent better |this place sucks my girlfriend found a  inch black hair intertwined in her meal i guarantee if gordon ramsey got served that plate he would throw it on the floor and fire someone they did replace her entree but we were thoroughly disgusted and cautious for additional bodily hair garnishes get with the quality control program chef ramsey cheers mate|that staff was super impolite to us when they served us food just like they want to throw the whole dish in our face never come back|every time we come to vegas we have to come eat at burgr unfortunately this time the only thing that was superb was the shakethe fries were too dry and the burgers tasted off it was a bit disappointing seeing as that the food here is usually amazing but didnt exceed prior expectations hopefully these problems will be fixed so that my family and i will once again have an outstanding dining experience|i use to go to this location regularly the last few time has got worse each visit the fried rice was flavorless  and stuck together the chow mein was cold and my green bean chicken breast was  old mushy green beans i do not recommend this location there are plenty others near by|rating this was a struggle i had been to the former madison menchies location several times and loved it but this was my first visit to the middleton location i ended up with a mix of vanilla snow dulce de leche and creamy peanut butter they were all tasty  i think the peanut butter was my favorite of the bunch reasons i cant quite give it three stars  at least three of the machines i tried were empty this location is on the smaller side so thats a pretty significant number of machines to be out of yogurt the two chocolate choices were included in the empty machines  one machine was just grinding and growling away  really unpleasant to listen to while in the store  no dole whip i realize flavors rotate but that was my main obsession at the other location and it was always there such a bummer  there was a huge puddle of water under my chair and another near the door  while walking out i slipped luckily i didnt fall but i got about halfway into the splits im generally clumsy so im pretty good at not hurting myself when i have a physical mishap but it easily could have been ugly i let the guy working the counter know and he said hed get it cleaned up the upsides of mechies are that you can sample before choosing your flavors and are in charge of doing that yourself so theres no waiting its a bright colorful shop and you can amass a fun spoon collection perfect for your lunch bag i tend to use mine for eating yogurt i know the shop has potential so ill be back fingers crossed it was just an off night|my husband and i had dinner here and it was just ok nothing outstanding for the inflated prices  had the squid and octopus starter  quite good for what was there  one piece of octopus and a handful of squid rings accompanied by lettuce  main course we  shared the steak for two   steak was charred outside and lacked salt for seasoning  potato was good but again vegetables lacked seasoning  all in all a decent meal but for this price very disappointed|as soon as i found this restaurant i wanted to try it but dont be fooled by all these reviews and stars on yelp the restaurant was freezing cold the service was awful the food wasnt very good and to top it off the server gave us some other persons credit card and ran away before we could tell her it wasnt ours in no way is that ok i will never go back to this restaurant again when we got there we were greeted with the most unfriendliest server i have ever seen she made us feel very unwelcome and as if we did something wrong by coming into the restaurant after we were seated we were ignored for a bit she never asked us if we had been there before or explained anything to us after we ordered she gave us some kind of sauce and some side dishes there was no explanation as to what any of it was we tried  of the  side dishes and only one of them tasted like anything and that was cucumber they were not good and the  we didnt try looked really unappetizing when the meat came out again no explanation about how to handle and cook the raw meat so that there is no cross contamination or cooking times to make sure the meat is cooked properly so that we don get food poisoning ever other restaurant that has you cook your own meat that i have been to tells you these things the meat was alright it was nothing special for the amount of stars and reviews this restaurant has i expected something better than mediocre  when we were finished we had to wait at least  minutes to get the check we noticed that the server kept looking at us but was trying to ignore us the table next to us who sat down while we were eating got their check before we did we finally got the check and gave them our card the sever then brought back the card and basically threw it on the corner of the table and ran away she had actually  given us the wrong credit card she ran away so fast we couldnt give it back luckily a tall skinny male server came an took it and brought our card|absolutely horrible experience and will not be returning again my two guests and i came to this theater for the first time tonight and none of us had an enjoyable experience before the previews started we placed our food and beverage orders with jourdan after being told that they were out of our first drink choices it took over fifteen minutes to actually get our beverages thirty minutes into the movie my meal and my friends appetizer arrived at this time i requested condiments and a refill from the food runner twenty minutes after that i still had not received anything i had asked for nor had my friends received their meals i managed to stop jourdan on his way past and questioned where our other meals were to which he responded with what food i then had to reorder our missing dinners as well as my drink and condiment over an hour into the movie our missing dinners finally arrived however they were barely warm by this point my food was ice cold as well granted this was my own fault as i had foolishly decided to wait to eat with my friends not knowing how long it was going to take eventually another server dropped off our bill just before the movie ended i still never got anything i asked for additionally i had been double charged for our meals after leaving the theater i requested to speak to a manager to deal with these issues and was informed to wait in line he already had two groups in front of me complaining after waiting  minutes a female employee came over and informed me that my food was comped that in itself earned them their  star however the employee then began to make excuses and tell me how i could have avoided the whole situation by asking to speak to a manager as soon as your food took a long time and get a manager when you got your bill that is not how you handle an unhappy guest i was there to watch the movie and enjoy the food i paid for not to miss it by talking to a manager in the middle of it the employee didnt seem to understand this concept however and just repeated that she took the food off my bill and next time to talk to a manager as soon as a situation arrivesthere will definitely not be a next time we will not be returning to this theater again your servers and runners need to be better trained in their jobs and your management needs to be more professional and taught how to treat and take care of their guests|we have been coming here for more than  years i can count on the fingers of one hand how many times this office runs on time with their appointments i get that sometimes the doctor or the dental assistant has to take a bit more time with one patient than another but when it becomes the norm then you need to consider scheduling less people into one day i am supposed to respect your business by being on time and paying my bill on time i would expect to have the same respect back to me in the doctor and dental assistant being available to see my kid at the time scheduled not  minutes or longer later|too high markups and that dumb no carry sign it is bad enough we have politicians eroding the nd amendment dont even trust their customers|fraud alert  i stayed at this howard johnsons dec  and paid with my credit card  two days later an unauthorized

sora jinya  small portions  they charge you for everything egg onions etc  they lie about the prices everything on the menu is not what they will charge you importantly they are always on the busy busy attitude no real acknowledgment of service more like a jobmost importantly the broth seriously no flavor i like my ramen with a unique flavor or options of meat and spicesall that spice is on the table with no labels  ramen can be great and enjoyable great broth with buttery noodles meat with broth almost heavenly done right my i dont understand monta when there is sooo much good ramen in las vegas|the food is not great everything tastes like it has been cooked in recycled oil but the delivery drivers are nice and they are open way past most restaurants offering delivery in the area|i have eaten here quite a few times never dined in always had delivery or carry out the pizza is greasy as hell but delicious none the less it is my preferred pizza joint even though their pizzas are pricey for two large pizzas you can expect to spend  bucks the salads leave quite a bit to be desired though their ranch and blue cheese are probably two of the best ive ever eaten french fries are great but soggy when delivered or carried out as they steam in their styrofoam container i quit eating from here about a year or so ago i felt like i was being nickeled and dimed every time i ordered good food though|this is the least friendly location ive been to i didnt get any dipping sauces with my chicken even though i asked for it once i finally got the attention of an employee they gave me one of each sauce and one of the sauces was the wrong one i tried talking to them again but was ignored so i just ate the chicken without the sauce i always get with no problem at other locations i expect more from cfa the food itself was good though|being a hairdresser means you have to be nice to people plain and simplei checked in online like i normally do i arrived at the designated time i answer

when i finally got a car windows down this is important for later and pulled up to the window to check out the attendant opened the window about  inches and stuck her hand out waiving at me to hand

but the gentleman couldnt have been nicer  thats why two starts and not just one|menu is great food was dialed in and half assed some dishes were not even completed service was less than stellar and could be due to the incompetence of the kitchen pick your battles|not recommendevery dish has significantly less meat less noodle mostly only soup egg rolls are not tasty had no quail egg at all in one dish overall experience is subpar attitude was not good|i shouldve really listened to some of the reviews i read before giving this place a try i ordered the chicken and steak combination with fried rice and a spring roll the only thing i could stand to eat is the spring roll the food had an awful smell with made me not want to eat the food i tried it anyway and was very disappointed that i wasted my time and money i wish i couldve gave a better review but i simply cant|this place is the worst the worst taiwanese food i have had and not cheap i dont understand how they got  stars this

had reservations upstairs at which point they tell us its closed upstairs at rx no email or call from the restaurant beforehand not the end of the world but shame on them sloppy from a high end place wont be going back|the pizza sauce was too much and too sweet for my liking the parking situation is difficult and not convenient|one of reasons i even like vq is because it is the nearest casino to our housei can take my elderly parents there they have older slot machines that dont need a computer wiz to explain how it works and a lounge where i can sit and watch a game as i wait for my parents now for the reason i gave it a bad score they let people hog ball the machinessomeone will place an ash tray on a stool and walk way and play elsewhere or they are playing two machines at the same time they dont take criticism to wellexample when the new casino openedthey got on their own facebook page and started taking pop shot at the desert casinoi responded saying it wasnt cool they deleted my post as well as others and they banned me from liking their pageyou can dish it out yet you cant take it i will take my parents to an other casino maybe fort mcdowell perhaps |i wish i could write a review about the food or service for this restaurant but each time ive attempted to come here the restaurant has been closed i understand this is a small business but i went during what i would call normal hours i am not sure how one would figure out what times the restaurant is actually supposed to be open in my opinion a business needs to have regular or reliable hours or else people arent going to take the time to even drive by to see if you are open after the second or third time of arriving to a closed restaurant|fyi because i got a note from a server who was like you dont know about the service industry i was in the restaurant business  years typically when someone walks before close they are allowed to order to eat  minutes past closing in most restaurants if there is a last call at  honor it i expect a smile and service until  servers that dont want people to walk  minutes before closing ruin diners experiences because they are tired but it is called service so suck it up or change jobs i tip well and that server lost   on serving  people and my friend refuses to go here again you may also notice someone else complimented this post because they had the same experienceupdated review taking all my stars away we showed up at  and they didnt want to serve us they said oh last call is at  we said ok we had  minutes and wed been there before we were open to ordering  big order of sushi fast and they said ok though they didnt want to we sat down knowing we would be rushed but open but no one came over with an order pad i mean we just left because it felt like they didnt want our business since it was late they were still serving two large parties that were going to be visiting and stuffusually we come here annually for my friends bday but she never wants to come back now|une boutique qui est seulement une mauvaise copie de best made  co a new york il y a de tout mais surtout du rien et les prix sont ridiculement cheramusant pour sy balader mais srement pas pour acheter le service tait en plus arrogant|i typically try a sushi restaurant a few times before forming my opinion but with so many awesome sushi options in vegas i prob wont be back to tokyo boys long wait times when there seemed to be lots of staff and only  or  other tables  staff was not attentive theyre friendly but dont seem to have the attitude stop go out of their way to make sure the guest experience is perfect  pricing was nearly double other offstrip sushi restaurants  quality was good but didnt seem to justify the price pointi left this feedback for the owner too so hopefully heshe received it|the food was good but the service was not good the restaurant was completely empty during lunch one of the servers was very impatient and rushed our orders|worst experience ever and i did not even go in the door  called to make an appointment they disconnected the phone call i called back which i never should of and made an appt  they texted me the night before my appt at  pm i was sleeping but in the morning texted back to say i would be there since i had taken  hours off work to be there and was told i was too late my appointment had been given to someone else stay away i should of read reviews before ever thinking about this placei would not even give one star but in order to post its a must|horrible almost inedible pizza we ordered six pizzas the crust was like cardboard and the toppings were incredibly sparse on my families pizzas we would have rather have spent the money on a legitimate pizza restaurant|weve been to agave south  times and wont be returning late on thanksgiving day our  yr old had a  degree fever a first for her and we called the office which gave us a recording for a nurse hotline when we called the hotline they required her doctors name  problem is we were only seen by a nurse and didnt receive any paperwork with her doctors name on it i had to get a manager on the phone to override and get advice  frustrating but could have been overcome   when my  month pregnant wife brought her in  days later still with a fever and fussy she waited in the waiting room for  minutes after her appointed time with no extra communication or dialog was brought into a patient room and saw a nurse briefly and was then left alone again for  minutes with no dialog or communication  my wife contacted me and i actually called the clinic to express the importance of someone getting in to see her or at least to communicate with her  the receptionist asked me to hold and promptly returned assuring me that someone would be in within  minutes to see her   minutes later and still with no communication my wife left with my daughter without anyone having attended to my  year old  i am not giving them a  rating because their care isnt sufficient but because their communication to their clients should be far more important  people dont mind negatives but they never like surprises had someone went to my wife taken responsibility for the delay and created a new expectation for a timeline then i would understand fully  but with a crying  year old and a pregnant mother a  minute wait with no explanation or apology is not a reflective of a company we are willing to do business with  disappointingly we were never contacted after that for an apology or explanation though my wife stopped at the front desk on the way out asked her to remove our file and to not to be billed for this trip due to the  minute wait and that the doctor never made it in  they knew of their error and still no communication  communication is key  i hope they fix this oversight|oh i thought well you guys should have pretty good chorizo no it was the most flavorless chorizo ive ever had in my life do not buy the beef

sucker is really hot with pieces of jalapenos in it so i always mix it  half mild half hot|i would not recommend this apartment ive lived here for  months my biggest current issue is that a mail box master key has been stolen and a criminal has been clearing out the mail room at least once a week my credit card was stolen and racked up  the office manage acknowledges it was stolen from my mailbox and promised to write a letter for the investigation she did not after asking about it she said she would do it next week and then the week after that im getting stiffed with a criminals bill because she doesnt have ten minutes if you need any assistance from the front office it will not happen you have to set up an appointment with the manager which also will not happen another instance my friend tried to get an apartment here she was given  different you do not qualify due to income calculations from the same person in the order of      and  simple math she makes  an hour and doesnt qualify im not sure how hard it is to do calculations of simple multiplications for qualifications but after six tries they should consider hiring a new front desk when i asked for help i was told i couldnt speak to the manager because it is a place of business i have an mba and i must have missed that day in school roaches yestheft yespoor customer service yesamenities awaiting parts for over a year yeslimited parking yesgates broken monthly yesa warm bed bring your own thats all you get rent a house dont get yourself into this level of frustration is my advice|kinda secluded and hard to find the gps didnt even want to direct us heremaybe that should have been a sign we should rearrange our plans for meal time we found it thoughunfortunately we were excited to try the steakhouse because the menu was so tantalizing and the website got us so excited with anticipation maybe that was the problem we get there and the four women working the hostess stand make a huge todo because they cant find our reservation for three people i am thinking well this must be good because they must be booked solid so people must love this joint nope they seat us and upon walking into the restaurant i am not even kidding you when i tell you there was one table of people among at least  booths and tables see pictures unbelievable the place was completely empty and they looked around for a reservation for five minutes i called three different times the week before and left messages for the steakhouse no one called me back i finally went online and made the stupid reservation not that you need one anyway anyway food was pretty gross salad bar looked like the selections were at least one week old discolored carrots and bell peppers and some really nasty looking tuna and potato salad the best part was the cheap little dinner rolls pretty sad|jeezi really wanted to like this place for those of you whom read the first few sentences to determine if a place is worthy heres my three word recap a big disappointment there i said it i pulled up to the drive thru at about  tonight  after feeling like i was singing hello by adele i mustve said it seven or eight times i finally heard a human voice reply the reply was sorry just a minute followed by about  more minutes of silence this gave me plenty of time to peruse the menu it was at this point that my ocd kicked in a bit as there were several misspellings on the menu when the voice came back i was ready i ordered the pastrami burger combo i pulled around the corner to find one car ahead of me once again the wait was longthe car ahead of me was there for about five minutes i pulled to the window and waited after about  more minutes i paid i got my order and away i went pulling back out onto centennial heading back to work with my food loot i could control my hunger no longer i reached into the bag and made contact the first thing i touched was lukewarm and soggy it was a french fry still my hunger pangs overrode this i ate the soggy fry maybe it was a fluke i again reached into the bag disappointment began to replace the hunger pangs i ate several more fries but to no avail they never got better i arrived back at work after a quick five minute drive i rushed in and sat at my desk i reached into the bag to find that the fries werent the only lukewarm item in the bag the burger the poor poor burger why would anyone do this to a cow why would they be so abusive the patty looked to be about as dry as the sahara the reviews i read of pastrami being piled onto this burger mustve been penned by someone working for the enquirer it was all lies there was hardly any pastrami on my burger youll be happy to know that the pastrami was competing with the burger patty over which one of them my mouth would find more dry my tongue and throat called it a tiesadly wimpy i wouldve rather not have paid today for the hamburger they served me matter of fact i wouldnt pay any other day of the week either wimpy you broke my burger heart back to spinach for mewith a side of olive oil|ill first start off by saying that i like the ambiance of this place nice decor and cigar friendly  i met my brother here for a few drinks as we are both huge fans of bourbon  its very difficult to see what kinds of bourbon they have available because they are placed behind the bar all over the place  they have  sections behind the bar where they keep their bottles and they have bourbon bottles mixed in with scotch and rye bottles  it would make more sense just to put all of them together instead of having to look all over the bar to see what kinds of bourbon they have  the bartenders have very little knowledge of bourbon  when we ordered our first drink they had no idea what it was i almost had to walk behind the bar myself to show him what bottle it was  my brother and i ordered a michters small batch for our first drink i have had it before but my brother hadnt  i was shocked when he told me the total was   michters small batch can be bought at the liquor store for  a bottle  when he brought me the receipt it said michters single barrel on it  i told him that price cant be right and could he double check the price  he told me it was correct  i told him he charged me for a single barrel and not the small batch and it was right on the receipt  they did nothing to rectify the problem  i dont mind paying a high price for a quality bourbon but i felt like i was taken here and they didnt want to fix the problem  i was clearly way overcharged for what i ordered  i will pass on this place next time  it definitely has potential if they can get some staff that is knowledgeable about the products theyre selling  if you are a true bourbon lover dont waste your time on this place|absolutely the worst experience ever  we went into the restaurant and asked for a table for two the lady said okay one moment  she then turned to her friend that came after us  she turned to them started talking and catching up with them and totally ignored us  i mean obviously ignored us  i assume she doesnt care for gay people or perhaps we were not the right race however we left dusted our shoes off and will not return|i had very bad experience here the price is a little bit highbut it tastes good the most worst things that i want to say is the poor serice the serious woman waiter wrote the final total payment for me and asked me to sign my name she wrote  tips for me and she did not even smile to me maybe i look like asian and she think that i would never come here twice after she asked me to sign my name for payingshe just left and did not give me a chance to ask her the question maybe i look young and asian i am studying in america and i just finished my final i want to have great time in las vegasbut this experience really made me upset i just want to share my true experience here i would never come here again thank you|do not hire joseph gaines owner of healthy pools hired him to fix my jacuzzi he charged me one price then wanted more and more money the job still isnt done from oct  no call no show on appointmentsexcuses after excuses for not completing the job he contracts the work out because he really cant do it himself argued with me extensively because i cancelled a part and insisted on a refundblames the distributor for everything i have serious doubt that what he fixedreplacedrefurbished is of any quality i have made several requests to have corrected invoices emailed and so far nothing as karla l states i thought joe was a hardworking small business man but he is a flake who was happy to take several thousand dollars and then just disappear after doing a soso somewhat unfinished job i wouldnt say he stole but i do think he gave us a lessthannew product and definitely didnt live up to his promises|i have pity for those who list this as their favorite restaurant in the city i treated a friend to a birthday dinner here and i dont know when ive been more disappointed with a place that gets such great reviews the service was ok the drinks ok the entrees were so salty they couldnt be finished though my guest is a runner and a certified saltaholic we both love dessert but blew it off because we couldnt wait to get out of the place did i mention that the place reeks of brussel sprouts|i tried to make a reservation for a month in advance  when i pressed select i was told an email confirmation would be sent  it never arrived  i tried calling and no one answers the phone  i tried email and live chat  all failed  they clearly dont want my

where there was piles of bloody tissue and we had to take her to the er we will be reporting this to the arizona medical board even if the test came back normal you still should of contacted us to do further testing on her this is completely unacceptable  this medical practice is completely worthless and negligent thanks for nothing|not sure what this restaurant thinks it is but not fine dining at

unprofessional  one bar tender forgot our chips and salsa for literally  minutes after being reminded of it twice  the other bartender was leaving so she asked if we could close out with her  this was fine except we ordered happy hour two for one drinks and was still drinking our first one  whats her solutionmake the second drink and let the ice melt in it until were ready for it  overall  bad service  bad experiencerecommendation  skip this place|went to the the raintree location for an estimate after clean freak messed up my carfound more damage to my car later that day called this location san victor dr to ask if they could add to the same estimate since i was in the area yes of course said the receptionist when i arrived the general manager was instantly and clearly frustrated that someone told me that they were on the same systemwell who told you that thats not the case at all thats not true you need to go back to raintreewhen i told him i spoke with the receptionist it was like i said look theres a unicorn it was such an absurd notion that his receptionist would mislead a customer after all its not like any other big corporation shares the same computer system amongst several stores she made an assumption and he was total jerk about it take responsibility and stop blaming the customers when you mess uphe was rude and essentially accused me of being in the wrong although it was the fault of his employeefirst impressions are everything in business this was a very bad experience  you couldnt pay me to return to this placezero stars|terrible dry sandwich

loved rockys for years since it started in madison we were so happy when one opened in sun prairie close to home we have been to this location several times and have been disappointed every time the service is horrible staff not friendly barely speak to you never seem to have single slices available and the crust has been doughy we decided to give it a try tonight and nothing has changed unfriendly staff cant even smile no slices ready had to wait  minutes no breadsticks eitherthe dough tonight was so undercooked and doughy we did not even finish our slices last visit to this location the east side restaurant was in major need of updating and new booths last time we were there but at least the pizza is cooked and staff friendly our adult kids have had same complaints and told us to

trainer chris marcosand keep an eye on your moneyi had highhopes for youfit when i joined less than  days ago it had been several years since my last gym membership experience my experience with youfit on north nd street was fine until i ran into an unexpected personal financial crisis i had signed up for personal training with chris marcos at an initial cost of  for  sessions and a  setup fee then on a monthly basis a payment or mo paid in  monthly installments of  each for  sessions per month on november   i made chris marcos aware of my financial situation and that i needed to suspend not cancel my personal training and installment payments until midjanuary  until i could work through my money crunch chris took  days to reply to my urgent message but assured me on november   that putting things onhold would be no problem one november th the very next day  was charged to my checking account and even after my objection and bringing this to chriss attention another  was charged to my checking account on december   these withdrawals made my money crunch even more difficult these charges were exactly what i had tried to avoid by requesting the suspension of my youfit account on november   for the better part of the last  days i have had to consistently chase chris marcos down insisting on updates and information had i not attempted to reach him several times a week for the last  weeks i doubt i would have received as much as a text to checkin todate i have been refunded only  of the funds that were withdrawn from my account after i requested that it be suspended also todate i have used only  sessions of the  sessions for which ive been charged  unused sessions this situation is now so untenable that i can nolonger continue to maintain a membership at youfit or a training arrangement with chris marcos i cancelled this morning december   after paying a  service fee to process my cancellationinsulting under the circumstancesive taken the additional steps of changing my bank account number and bank card number and implemented a refusal of any future attempts to withdrawal funds from my account by youfit or its billing company as well ive opened an unauthorized withdrawal investigation at my bank against youfit as of today i have  unused training sessions that i cannot use because this billing situation has made attending youfit impossible for mei have too much integrity to work with a company and an individual who lack integrity altogether to add insult to financial injury this morning chris marcos once again blamed me for this situation by texting me you signed up for pt you knew what you were doing although it is true that i did sign up for pt i did not sign up for my account being hit for  after a suspension was agreed upon youfit and chris marcos cannot seem to be able to do the right thing so i will be telling everyone i know of their business practices posting this review on other social media filing a formal bbb complaint and contacting the consumer complaint departments of channels     and  in the phoenix area i may also proceed with a smallclaims suit simply out of principle shame on youfit and shame on chris marcos for not doing the right thing|are here a few weeks ago with my son and needless to say i was very very disappointed the food has no taste whatsoever the sushi is like something you get a gas stop down in arkansas worst part about the whole meal was it was supposed to be a nice lunch for two but a baby cockroach in my sons water  made it a party for three the waitstaff didnt feel the least bit bad over this dilemma i pleaded to have a discount on my meal as the cockroach was scurrying across the table running from the subpar food i spoke with the manager and he offered a  discount on my sons food that really wouldnt even cover the amount of food and water the cockroach consummed i would not eat here if it was the last place on earth its dirty its nasty and nothing has a taste and they have bugs id sooner eat chipped ham from the bathroom floor of heinz field with my hands tied behind my back|first time coming here with high expectations and it wasnt what my family and i had expected at all unfortunately the dining experience here was downright awful first off as soon as our group of  entered the restaurant we were bombarded with the scent and sight of smoke shortly following the food was terrible the salads included too much cheese and the pasta was too salty with no other flavor in general we had such high expectations and left with a disappointing result we will not be returning to this restaurant|im really disappointed with the service managers at camelback kia a few weeks ago my wife and i began tire shopping for her sedona minivan i have had a good experience in the past with this dealer and weve done thousands of dollars of warranty work under their care so i decided to check here first the service representative told me that they would match the price of discount tire she also agreed to throw in a free alignment it sounded like a good deal so i made sure to get everything in writing when i returned a week ago to buy tires from kia and have my alignment done they told me they would not honor the quote that was given to me they made a copy of the written quote and validated it but refused to perform the work promised it shows a lack of integrity apparently the employee had left however the quote is on their printout and is a quote representing the dealer not merely the employee i understand that sometimes sales people give unauthorized incentives to make a sale but if i have a quote from the dealership in writing and signed i expect to at least get what they told me they would give me sadly i dont think will be returning anytime soon to have work done at this dealership|if i could give this place  a star i would sat down had to wait like  minutes for a hostess to even come to her stand then after we were seated it look at least  minutes for anyone to come over after someone did i asked for a happy hour menu which the server said we could only have at the bar which was like  feet away from where we were sitting once sat at the bar it took at least another  minutes for someone to come by and ask us for a drink order although there were  people behind the bar already once we ordered our drinks the server asked if we wanted a refill on chips for a small charge a charge for a refill on chips what fucking mexican restaurant forces you to pay for a refill on chips and salsa food from the happy hour menu took  minutes to get as the assistant gm talked to the table behind us for  minutes about where they were from totally disregarding if we needed anything oh side note she comped them guacamole just because and didnt bother to check on any of the other patrons food was very good compliments to the chef but service was below disappointing for  i could have gotten robertos a bottle of patron and just stayed home|the only reason this place has two stars is because the food was ok if i was solely rating the service it would be  star  i arrived on a nonbusy week night with my boyfriend for some food and drinks  the hostess greeted us and sat us at a good table  our waitress came soon after and took out order  we had a coupon that she presented to us  after she got done rolling her eyes she said that she had to ask the manager about the coupon  the coupon was approved and we ordered our food  while we were eating we needed more fixings sour cream guacamole tomato so we asked out server for more  she failed to mention that it costs extra for more sour cream  as we were finishing up our meal i guess it was taking to long for us to leave so the server decided to put our check on the table and hover around until we put a credit card down  keep in mind we were only at the place an hour tops  as we put the credit card down we again reminded our server that we had the coupon  she took it with the check  she came back and placed our receipt on the table  we looked it over and she had not used the coupon  when asked about this she simply said sorry about that you can use it next time  really chick  never mind that we were from out of town  i was beyond annoyed at this point  for me service can make or break a mealoverall  food ok  service young and unprofessional recommendation skip this place and go elsewhere|didnt really do what i asked but for  i cant really complain i asked for a fade and didnt get one asked for a trim up top and all they did was thin it out if youre a bum and need a desperate haircut this is the place for you|absolutely avoidive been and my bride is currently under contract at pbf  im not returning and will be going to charlotte athletic club  what has me most annoyed is their lack of customer service  if you need out of a contract there you basically need a presidential pardon  my wife was promoted to a position with a local company that requires her to work out of nyc jersey and dc and is only here a handful of days monthly  this change in lifestyle is not enough to merit being released from contract so she is paying while being on the road  a contract is a contract but their arrogance and absolute lack of customer service is what is prompting me to warn you guys  not only have they been impossible to work with they go weeks without responding to simple questions and then pass the issues off elsewhere  it has taken  months to get them to produce an actual contract which failed to provide as promised when signing up for the membershipbe cautious if you expect any sort of lifestyle change  she has yet to establish a nd residence which is required to get out of the contract  being away often does not suffice  long story short  avoid poor customer service arrogant  deplorable communication unprofessional difficult to work with thank you for reaching out dinoi agree its quite alarming that in this day and age timely responses professionalism and overall understanding of life change is an issue with local business  i waited as long as i could and shes currently waiting to leave feedback via social media not to mention within her corporate social circle  she asked multiple times for contract copy and it literally took two months to get it  she spoke to brody who was also impossible to work with  she reviewed the conversation she had with the gentleman she signed up with and his response was couldnt tell you he doesnt work here anymore  the fact is her job change while not establishing new address was a certainly life changing adjustment that wont allow her to utilize what she has already paid over  for  id say you got your moneys worth out of the  classes she was able to attend prior to this promotion  from a client stance your company most certainly does not value every customer  the conversations held with her were most certainly unprofessional flippant and showed no regard to value of the client it shocks me that pure body fitness studio sees it as prudent and justifiable to force a client to remain a member and continue to draft money from their account knowing the lifestyle change that has occurred   your help with this matter will most definitely be appreciated|my heater stopped working in middecember when it was reaching  degrees at night  i used custom cooling years ago and they seemed fair and reasonable  i called and they said it would be a  service charge which i agreed to  steve came out looked at the unit for  minutes and said the blower motor needed to be replaced  he wrote an estimate for   i had to pay the  service charge steve said he had the part and it would take an hour  that price seemed way too high so i called around and neighbor referred me to dave at mountain air  he came out and replaced the blower motor and fixed the unit for   i dont know what happened to custom cooling  maybe they sold out or got too big  my advice is to skip them altogether  im a single middleaged female but i have rehabbed several houses and own rentals and i hate getting ridiculously high quotes and getting ripped off because i look like a dumb blond|food is bland salad was good apps were frozennot homemade  hibachi was i better than any chinese buffet then to boot wouldnt take the groupon that i purchased for there  wouldnt go back there for free|i ordered a to go pho combination the container of the soup is broken and they said that the combination is a lot is only  pieces of meat and no tendons no good|the cuts are alright but the service is horrible the place is not family friendly the price for cuts is too much im never coming here again|poor job on my nails every color i picked out for gel was not available so the gal picked out a sparkle pink for a french tip manicure for the end of my nails that turned out to be brown making my fingernails look dirty i called the next day spa lady answered told me to come before  or after  pm so i took off work arrived at  and was told sorry to busy come back tomorrow i explained that i was told to come before  pm a man got involved and said he had no time to busy cannot promise  would work either come back tomorrow and walked away they are eager to have clients but not eager to solve a problem so good luck if you visit the sun prairie location very rude with absolutely no customer service went to another nail salon explained the situation and they redid my nails for  dollars saying they get a lot of un happy customers from blush|ive been to bri on a number of occasions and i usually am impressed by their service and products  last night not so much  during our visit we had to wait  minutes to get our bill  yes i counted the minutes exactly after we finished our dinner  apparently management decided to run with one server and one bartender for the evenings dinner rush and their server was far from ready to handle that volume  ive been a server before for a number of years so i understand that when you get slammed with tables it can be overwhelming however my issue is more so with the lack of empathy for the wait  i had to flag down the server for my bill no he did not prebus the table and instead of saying i will be right there he moved his head back as an acknowledgment of us needing our bill  no big deal youre busy and i get that but at least acknowledge me with words and not a headbob from across the room like were friends or family instead of delivering the check himself with an apology for the wait a manager came to deliver the bill  as it turns out their point of sale system went down and they were scrambling around trying to fix it  i understand but an apology from the server is all we needed eg hey im slammed and am sorry about the wait  no that did not occur  the manager delivers our bill and i hand him the cards to split the bill  he returns with the cards having split the check and guess what  wrong amounts charged on both cards  my bill was  and we were charged  each  did we get comped that would have been nice but lets make sure and ask before we assume anything  i flag down the manager again and no we were not comped he just made a small mistake  not a big deal as that can happen and im not upset about paying for my full bill he returns with our cards again and it looks like the mistake was corrected and a quick update that our cards will only be charged once but heres another caveat  my card was not handed back to me  i flag down the manager again and apparently gravity is at fault sorry bro gravity was the statement provided thats professional  today i open up my bank account online and guess who charged me twice  great work bri  you get to waste more of my time on another day  youve proven youre not quite ready to handle a small number of tables and your staff is ill prepared by management to cope with a challenge so why did this whole thing bother me so much  ive done the job before and handling a dinner rush isnt hard if you multitask  when you go to the back of the house  make sure your hands are not empty and take dirty glasses and plates from your tables prebus  apologize to your tables and let them know youre busy but youre giving an effort and just be a professional  youre a brewery so i expect a level of casualness but is an apology that hard to deliver  youre better than last night bri and ive seen you guys shine where is the englishaustralian fellow that serves tables and essentially makes bri worthwhile when you go there   get your crap together and retrain employees on customer service  multitasking as a server is essential and its not hard to be professional and take accountability when you mess up  just apologize and your tables will understand  i certainly would have if you took the nine seconds to come over and say the magic words i am sorry im so busy i will try better next time best of luck to you bri|do not frequent this establishmenti wish i could rate  stars this was possibly the worst delivery experience i have ever had i decided to give the restaurant another try after an initial attempt led to a canceled order because the restaurant stated they were too busy to deliver okay so fast forward a few weeks later and i order the combo platter with greens and mac  cheese and some red velvet cake more than an hour later the order arrives i noticed there was no mac  cheese and notify grub hub delivery service grub hub contacted the restaurant and spoke with the owner who stated that he made my order and that everything was included he refused to provide a replacement for the mac  cheese and refused to refund a portion of the payment i was totally floored by his response and have decided to not give this restaurant any more of my business why would he insinuate that i needed to lie about not having an order of mac  cheese i am truly incensed and will do my best to make sure that no one i know goes to this restaurant after reading some of the other reviews i can see that the restaurant has pulled the same game on them claiming there were no missing items everyone cant be wrong there is only one common denominator in all of the complaints and that isthe restaurant|i had two terrible customer service experiences in one week with this pharmacy first time i was the only one in line my prescription was almost ready and they told me they were closing for lunch and id have to come back in an hour two days later back to get the same prescription there were  people working behind the counter only one in line and received no help for a full  minutes i even watched  people come through the drive thru and leave because they were not helped i will be getting my prescriptions at walgreens from now on|this store has to be the dirtiest retail store i have ever been in  the management and staff are not professional at all and sadly it appears they hire anyone to work  they need new management|dont even think about using these guys i was in a bind and needed something fast i called their customer service number and was assured that if i ordered by sunday night the cards would be here on tuesday i even called back and confirmed this once i place the order well guess what they missed the truck and wont be here until tomorrow overnight prints i think not they should change their name to missed the truck and will be there  days later prints|had no problems with shipping christmas cards last year with these guys this year was a different issue i ordered my cards in the th of december to have it arrive on the th which was a friday on friday the shipping info still said pending so i called them and the gentleman said that we have it scheduled for a monday delivery the st fine i waited all of monday and still nothing so i called them again in tuesday and all chad the representative told me was that its scheduled for the th when i told him it was supposed to be delivered by the th his response was estimated dates are not guaranteed like some robot im sure he got a lot of calls like that but a little empathy and compassion goes a long way in customer service since the company you work for messed up thanks for messing up our christmas cards for our babys first christmas|if i could give zero stars i wouldi ordered christmas cards for a client followed all instructions this isnt my first order with them either the prints came out defective cut error according to their csr i emailed pictures as instructed called waited on hold for  min and was told hold on while i check to see if we need them back and to get the reprint authorized the reprint was authorized they didnt ask for the originals back and never said anything about keeping them so i assumed my only mistake here that the issue was resolved and i threw the defective prints away i was told they would arrive at the pick up location on friday friday came and went and i didnt get a confirmation so i called on saturday and was told our production department wasnt able to fulfill that order so it didnt go out till the next day so they will be available on monday  days before christmas i asked if there was anything they could do for me maybe a partial refund so i could offer something to my client was told the only thing we would offer in a situation like this is part of the shipping back but since you only paid  handling fee for the pickup we arent able to offer you anythingok whatever monday i went to pick up the reprints and low and beholdanother cut error not as noticeable as the first but also not something i want to associate with my brand either i followed the protocol and called them again waited on hold for  minutes this time i asked for a refund because at this point my client wouldnt get them out before christmas they said no problem well email you a return label and as soon as we get the original order and reprinted order we can issue the full refundi said i dont have the originals since i wasnt told to keep them they had to check with management and their response since you threw away the originals we can only offer you a  refundso i asked to speak to a managerthey were conveniently unable to speak with me but were readily available to answer their csr with a bogus refund they took down my number and said i would get a call back that daythis was yesterday still no callso i am now paying them to make mistakes ill only get  back but will have nothing to show for it must be how they make their money well live and learn ill spend the extra money for a company who actually stands behind their productsgrammar and punctuation are out the window during a rant|hard to enjoy a meal with disrespectful karate kids running around everywhere  they just run all around the outside area with no regard for customers food was ok but hard to enjoy|really rude staff  the eye rolling and side commentary definitely over shadowed the foodthe food is great and the menu has a nice variety itd be nice if the staff looked like they wanted to be there|horrible i mean how can a hamburger place run out of french fries then the staff didnt even seem to care or volunteer a discount check your inventory its not that hard|hope they have a lot of money probably been here at least thirty times and it has been pretty consistent called in to pick up two tucsons and was told forty minutes no training at all for this guy on the phone picked up after he called back and said that forty minutes was for delivery both meals were cold and skimpy on the secret sauce always has been good and i can see quality and service slipping  hate to see this restaurant fail get it together guys|food was cold waiter did not even check to see how we were doing did not come to refill water till the end of our dinner cup was empty for my whole dinner it wasnt busy so dont know what the excuse is bad first and last time|i wish i could select zerostars but im forced to chose at least one thursday afternoon  pm place is empty me my wife and my daughter my daughter does not enjoy japanese food so we brought her own subway meal when i told the female server is just going to be two eating she gave me a disgusting face and star moving her head saying not here i said she can eat this here right pointing to her meal and she just move her from left to right giving us a disgusting face again and pulling the menus away from us we turn around and left i guess they prefer an empty restaurant than receive revenue from two customers i really like to support small business but this attitude really kills it my daughter felt bad as she couldnt enjoy a meal with us eating what she liked  way to go|i took my car here to get repaired and the service advisor said that he wouldnt even bother if it was his car  well over  in repair costs and  weeks later i received my car  there are greasy handprints on the overhead in several locations on the interior there is a spot on the bumper that is not painted and they left the windshield wiper access panel doors laying in the engine compartment  it was supposed to be finished in  weeks but there were new scratches on the door and rough paint spots on the roof  they repaired those in about a week but when we went to pick it up there was a dimple in the bumper  so it took another week to get that fixed  finally went to pick it up and we felt they were kicking us out the door  the only reason we went there is because usaa recommended them  will not use them again|absolutely horrible humiliating embarrassing experience stay away from this place they only want your money they could not care any less about you as a human being all they see is  signs|ugh where to start the hotel is a timeshare so be prepared to to be accosted by sales people every single time you step foot in the lobby seriously every single time  i asked why as a paying hotel customer why i had to endure the continued onslaught of sales pitches and was told that i made the choice to stay in a timeshare hotel  restaurant choices were extremely limited during the day the restaurants are closed and the buffet was closed down we were only able to get lunch at the sports deli pizza hut closes at pm or boxed sandwiches at the coffee shop  the edge steakhouse was closed down for our stay as well  we tried sids and was extremely disappointed with the overcooked lobster and extremely poor service so we decided to forego trying the asian or italian restaurants  the only other  restaurants in the building we ended up headed out on the monorail to find food it was nice to go to other casinos and actually have choices our room was next to the elevators would have been nice to have had insulation in the wall  our bed backed up to the elevator shaft and we got to hear it go up and down all night long the day i checked in i saw where there were toothpaste droplets on the front of the bathroom sink and waited to see if housekeeping would ever actually wipe them down they did not for the  days i was there so that toothpaste may have been there for years for all i know the room was supposed to be an upgraderemodel unless they were going for the wornout s look the remodel was unsuccessful or they skipped this room i liked the dealers in the casino  they were friendly and a bright part of an otherwise unremarkable stayother notesthe resort fee is day which includes wifi if you dont pay the resort fee wifi is daythe concierge suite includes breakfast and has free water you can take back to your room water is ea in your room it also includes alcoholic drinks from pm with an appetizer buffet salad pizza  sliders overall the most annoying thing was the constant sales pitches in the hallway for this alone we will never ever ever stay at this hotel again|to the management team at westgate las vegas resort  casino it is clear to see where your priorities lievery seldom do i ever take the time to write a review i also want to point out that this is the first time i have ever written a negative one but seeing how it has been  days since the incident i find it no problem at all to take time and write just how horrendously vile the customer service is the management team have made it loud and clear that actions speak louder than words they have chosen to make zero contact with us despite the fact that a hand written description was submitted about the incident on the very same dayon saturday the th of december me and my family were approached at planet hollywood by a team of representatives from the westgate hotel they had explained all these packages and perks that we could be a part of if we agree to see a min presentation so after agreeing to the terms and providing all of our information we were eventually taken over to the westgate hotel at this point we had already invested over an hour of our time when for a rd time we were asked the same information however this is where i would like to take a minute to explain just how terrible the representatives at the westgate hotel are as we were being sized up by their representative deisy  she asks us a series of questions in the following way are you both married usyes do you have documentation to prove your married usnot with us on a trip no are you sure you are married usyes do you have anything that proves your married usno not with us are you an american citizen usyes are you sure you are both american citizens usyes but you have nothing with you that proves you are married usno how much do you make weekly or on a salary write it down usok this is where my husband and i at this point are so uncomfortable at how she is drilling us on our personal life as if she works for immigration my husband writes down our weekly pay again i say weekly pay as she gave us an option and then she tells us to sit down and wait minutes later we are pulled in front of everyone by arnold who tells us this is the end of your trip with us you can go wait for a shuttle to take you back to the strip and carry on with your trip and we will give you your money back at this point we are so humiliated disgusted tired hungry but more than anything in utter shock at how horrible the customer service is arnold made it a point to say that we need to leave immediately due to something we circled in our paperwork paperwork that we never filled out but its now our problem so we say we never circled anything deisy did he then says no she wouldnt have but i will ask her infront of you guys because if thats the case then we will fix it she admits she circled it but then arnold decides to change the direction of conversation and back up her mistake and asks us to leave he escorts us out of a back door and has us leave i cannot explain just how humiliating  embarrassing they made us feel and for a mistake their staff made we were asked to leave as if we suddenly had no value in their eyes they make it a point to mention over and over that they spent  million to renovate this hotel clearly they spent no time in selecting a team that have any customer service skills or etiquette they are just interested in your money they also mention they rely on word of mouth so that is why i will have no problem letting everyone know just how hideous they are having moved from the united kingdom a couple of years back i am more than happy to spread the wordand to the management team please do not waste your time posting a prewritten apology reply for reviewers to see because the truth of this situation is that after submitting a written description of our experince and submitting it to the reps at planet hollywood you chose to take no time out to rectify how we were treated  days agoabsolutely horrible humiliating embarrassing experience stay away from this place they only want your money they could not care any less about you as a human being all they see is  signs|dont eat here unless you want to be overchargedon december  we decided to celebrate my daughters asu gradation dinner at black and blue the atmosphere was pleasant and the server was attentive and polite  the food was good and calamari was excellent  at the end of the evening i tipped the waiter exceptionally well and signed my credit card receipt the problem came when i received my online back statement i was over charged i called the resturant both times i was told a manager would call me back this never happened  finally i called my bank i wont be dining at this restaurant againkris|i thought id give this place another go because i really want to like it  this time the husband came with and we pretty much left saying we werent going to hurry back  i do want to say that the staff was great  we were greeted when we walked in the door and service was prompt and friendly  and i like how theyve decorated the place to give it a welcoming vibe  but the food while my husband and i both agreed that none of the food we ordered was bad it wasnt great either  my favorite thing was the jalapeno cheese curds  they were pretty good  my husband got a blt potato soup and salad all of which he said were just okay i got the club sandwich and while the bread was pleasantly toasted the sandwich as a whole was kind of dry and the bacon was not crisp and had an odd flavor  and the sweet potato fries looked a little burnt and tasted dry  i took one bite of the fries and had enough  im sure our server wouldve brought a new order if i had said something but i didnt get the impression that even cooked right they would be worth the calories  maybe i am just not ordering the right things off the menu like i said i really want to like this place|this is located in the lodge area which is horrible as hell if i could give this place a  i would we waited over an hour to get our order taken and after all of that they gave me the wrong stuff but we had already left and didnt

plane intercom the attendants basically told us to not waste our breath asking if we were going to make out connections they did not know if we would be delayed when i ran up to my connecting gate  minutes after the door closed i politely asked if the flight had already boarded the attendant did not even look up from their screen and did not say a word they just nodded and smirked as if it was my fault for being late i quickly called aa got on the next flight out went up to the next gate i was going to fly out of and waited patiently to be seen finally a  second employee joins the counter and asks me why im up there let him know i was trying to get my boarding pass and seat he proceeds to ask me for my boarding pass for this flight i repeated as to why i was there he scoffed at me and then looked up my name printed my ticket and lunged it towards me quite aggressively and didnt say a word nor even look up it was clear that i the customer was an inconvenience even though i remained patient calm and friendly the entire time the only reason i gave a second star was because the lady i spoke with on the phone to get on the next flight was incredibly professional helpful and

listening  maybe because she had such a big order before us she wasnt thinking  but i ordered the simi serious burger with tomatoes lettuce onions fresh jalapenos and guacamole  dressing and spicy seasoning hubby got the serious burger welp got waxed peppers instead of jalapenos and no guacamole  i dont even think they put the spicy seasoning on it  this burger was so bland  im glad we brought it home  i had to bust out with my own seasonings to make it taste ok  so  burgers and  med onion rings   it wasnt worth it  not even a drink for that price  there onion rings are really good though

valentines day puppy that was not the case at all the puppy we got was not from the litter she told me if i knew the puppy would have been so young we would have waited if she would have called me back we could have arranged itanyway we were extremely upset the puppy was so young and she offered to take the puppy back for a few weeksbut she had already been weaned and the mother moved out we decided to keep her she is a gorgeous dog with great personality but has had constant stomach issues and diarrhea when we got her she had it and she constantly is getting diarrhea weve been to the vet  times for her to be treated and those are the times we went it gets so bad she bleeds from her rectum we feel so bad for her and its very messy she turns a year december finally i ran into a guy at the dog park with a doodle and it just so happens he got his dog from az doodles his dog is three months older and was told his dogs sires were sookie and apollo joella told us that our dogs sires were sookie and apollo and it was sookies first litter how is that possible if his dog was from the same parents something is not adding up the guy also felt he got his puppy too young but it is a

ask you to park and wait for your food in the parking lot with the other fleet of cars they have waiting already and then if your lucky the cashier will bring you the correct order after guessing which car it goes to|great food service is extremely inexperienced and slow however i do think the food is amazing please hire staff with experience your business will thrive|if i could give it a zero i would  very time consuming  buses sometimes run  minutes or more apart  huge pain  most times i uber where i want to go to avoid this place|i really wanted to try this place since it was rated

knowing that the order had already been approved and the receipt had already printed out i will be checking my bank account when i get back i ordered the hot ham and swiss on marble rye bread easy right wrong when my sandwich was ready it was cold i ordered a hot ham and swiss they took it back and threw it on their panini grill when i got the sandwich back i found a piece of someones hair in one half when i tried a bite of the other half i found it lacked flavor and pizzazz i was hoping for a more unfortunately we are spoiled in las vegas and have other places i would rather spend my money at with better quality food i would not recommend this place for lunch  what a let down|just ok probably wouldnt go back  the bruschetta was bland and when we were asked what we thought we told our waiter it wasnt that good and it needed something we asked for balsamic and he brought it and after being offered the additional hot oil and a little balsamic it improved the tastethe lasagna wasnt anything i would order again  it was ok but not at all what i was expecting or cared for portion seemed small for the price and didnt have much eye appeal the mango salad had a little going for it but the mango was so under ripe and it was hard so didnt have the sweet flavor youd be hoping for|since im a big shabu shabuhotpot fan i was really excited to try this place however its just meh one order of fishseafood tofu is just  pieces of it that are sliced into twos so  pieces total  basically each order consists of too little it would cost only a few cents retail to give an extra slice or piece they also have bbq but the meat quality is not goodi dont think ill be coming here again its overpriced and the quality and quantity is not worth the price|i am outraged at this company we had a guy named chris  come by  days ago he offered us this great package deal to go with dish he told us that even if we were locked into another contract with another company that dish would pay up to  on that contract then he looked at my moms bill and said nope your not locked into a contract if you were it would be on your bill chris out and out lied to us i am unemployed right now and my mom  is on social security we cannot afford this i told her to just cancel dish and go back to direct shes considering it but our direct dish is gone chris took it with him she did call the company and talk to someone but nothing has been done yet chris ought to be fired but if i know the company  will make an excuse for what he did or  will accept his excuse he needs to own up to it my mom called and left him a message on his phone he hasnt even had the integrity or honesty to call her back if it was my decision i would cancel them today but its not be assured i will tell everyone i know or meet what this company did to us|had the chicken katsu sandwich and it was drenched in grease the chicken was super greasy im only giving a  star because i liked the sauce  the friesutterly disappointed however my husband enjoyed his burger|i had a photo shoot with glamour shots at the  north frank lloyd wright blvd scottsdale az location on   it took over a month to get any photos digital or hardcopy and now over two months later i am still missing prints i paid for and never received  i complained twice over a month ago and was promised by the manager that the missing x photo prints would be mailed to me  again two months later and i have not received photos i paid for  over priced shady and extremely unprofessional business operation  do not use this location  rmj|i ordered the two chicken taco plate  got a bone in the chicken  the beans tasted like lemons and the rice tasted like soap  awful food|the pizza was just ok  its all prepped ahead of time who knows how long and the crust looks like something you buy in the italian aisle of the grocery story to let your kids have fun making their own pizzabut the service and unorganized assembly line was unacceptable  i ordered a pizza listed on the wall  they are supposed to know what goes on their pizzas not me  so i say i want an xyz whatever it was  and the first person has to look at the wall and see what goes on it  then i get passed to person number  the paper says what i want he asks me what it is me  i dont know you work here  so then we both look at the wall and see what goes on it  repeat again for assembly line person number by person number  i decide ok im tired of this crap im just gonna tell them what i want on it  person  goes by fine  now i get to person   same thing starts to happen so i just say sun dried tomatoes and i think were done because i dont want anything else on my pizza  he says what  i say sun dried tomatoes they are literally right in front of him and right in front of me  he says what again  so i say sun dried tomatoes and point  and this sets off an uproar dont put your hand over the glass sir  i swear someone was going to take me down for pointing  if i didnt have my kids with meanyhow ok pizza  stars dumb process with kids that cant remember what they sell executing it |not sure why i continue to stop at this kfc first visit food was great second visit we got home and bit into the biscuits and they were all raw dough rd visit the forgot a couple items th visit tonight i sat in the drive thru ever and then decided to go in i witnessed the female manager arguing with a male employee who was using fbombs very unprofessional the male employee clocked out and left i stood for awhile and i think they forgot my order i was the only one standing and waiting place was empty the service is slow employees are unprofessional im taking my business back to canes its worth the drive|pretty disappointed overall i made an order for delivery just a few minutes before closing they delivered my food pretty quickly about  min and i was happy they took the late order the veg egg rolls where decent little did i know they would be the best part of the meal next i had the hot and sour soup this is the first time i ever ordered this soup but it was a cold night and sounded good  it was hot in temperature and that was about it the flavor was bland and i didnt like the consistency unfortunately after  bites i couldnt eat anymore i followed up with general taos chicken not the most authentic dish but one that i like to get down on when im feeling naughty tasted like the chicken was fried in the fish batter the chicken quality was questionable and again after a few bites i decided it wasnt worth the calories overall i was very disappointed which is too bad because the late night  delivery was a nice option|really bad service the wait time is like ages having travelled all the way from ca to las vegas by road we were very hungry  yelp had really good reviews for this place but now i wonder how its been atleast  mins since our order and there has been no sign of food there is no coordination between the waiters we got asked twice for order the table beside us got their roti after they were done with their meal i have no idea how their food tastes but their service sucks big timeif you are hungry and looking for quick food dont ever think of coming here|cool spot with a great location setup and vibe however my food came out cold not cool but noticeably cold in the middle and upon being reheated a second time underwhelmed  by the time my food came back out my coworker was done eating disappointingly there was no concession or apology for the mistake i wasnt even thinking it would be comped but at least maybe a free drink or something may or may not be back|i have always had nothing but problems with this movie theater before and after the remodel before the remodel the theater was poorly managed plagued with constant bathroom floods poor sound quality and was run down after the remodel the bathroom problems still exists and you cant really get a seat unless you order it on line hours in advance knowing that the theater was going to probably sell out and i wanted to see star wars on my one day off a week i ordered tickets on line once i entered the movie theater and was purchasing the over priced concessions i noticed a line of people at a register close to the exit but didnt think nothing of it i proceeded to the theater room and noticed it was completely empty i walked back to the theater entrance and listened to a young girl saying that the movie ticket i purchased was an sff sensory friendly films made for autistic children that included a lower volume and some deleted scenes wtf are you kidding me i cant see star wars like this and enjoy it these type of movies are generally played around  am on a saturday not on the weekday before xmas at pm i have no problem with supporting the handicap but  pm on a weekday evening with one of the most popular movie to dateare you kidding me there was nothing online showing that this movie was going to be in sff format when i ordered it online as i go back to the front im now starting to realize why there was a line at the front inside register the sold out show didnt have a single person inside the theater because everyone demanded their money back people ordered online just like i did and it was never listed as an sff showing so here i go waiting in line with other frustrated people some who had children dressed in star wars attire some who had to get babysitters for their night out all waiting to get their money back just like me this theater ruined their evening out one customer even purchased their tickets  weeks in advance my girlfriend was at the concession getting her money back for the over priced snacks and i was in another line being asked if i would like to return for the pm show i quickly said no this was my last time ever coming to this theater i just want my money back and thanks for ruining my one day off a week when i just wanted to enjoy a movie this theater thought it was more important to have an empty showroom and upset customer then to have a room full of happy paying customer thanks again amc rainbow promenade you will never see me again|i went to see the store under its new owner im so hurt that its lost the appeal the prices are ridiculously high no cars in the lot and a few of us wandering through the isles searching for a reason that this new owner would trip at least the prices for the products maybe hell just write off this business im voting for trader joes and i will continue to support common ground what a disappointment|this place is big open and clean customer service is great and they have those soda machine with  flavored drinks but overpriced for what it is they say fresh but one bite made me sick a entree plate is  this place is not a real dim sum place its just a rip off version of panda express my husband and i  grabed  plates and  drinks came out to  my husband was so disappointed for that price you can go to a real dim sum get fresh food more portions better options for cheaper the only item they carry thats like a real dim sum restaurant is the  options of sui mai pork chicken beef shrimp sorry but we wont be back rather spend my money on real dim sum restaurant oh and a side order or cart of one item is  before tax and half filled and  for  for sui mai|overpriced chinese food with ehhhhhhhh taste  i ordered a scallion pancake and there were about  or less scallion flakes used  usual scallion pancakes the scallions are all over with the one here you need a microscope to see  i also ordered a wonton noodle  nothing special  my friends meals were pretty bad as well  never again  do yourself a favor drive off the strip if you want better chinese cuisine|place is very well decorated lots of colors there are  sections  bar section with flat screen tvs  dining room service was great went for a pick up and ended up having a margarita  which was delicious btw but the food  i had the cod tacos expensive for one small piece of fish in each taco and was expecting a good home made tortilla de harina but it was thicker a bit and softer it also sucked to have this cheap melted orange cheese in the taco for sure its not a traditional mexican joint but still good to grab a beerdrinks since they have an happy hour special or lunch|this place is full of lies they will promise you so much and for some people it will be to late to discover that they were scamyes guys this people here are nothing but scammers  be carful|service is horrible been there  times and never got waited on  so save your  time and money and go some  where else|due to severe allergies the only gluten free pizza my sons friend can eat is zellas  tonight they closed at pm for a company party  i called in at pm to place an order  they would not take it  even after explaining the allergy situation they still refused  ive ordered from there before and the service was good but the pizza was horrible  the only reason i tried to order from there this time is the allergy situation and service was not customer friendly  i will never call them again|after all the time i spent in korea with the air force i wouldnt say im an expert in korea or korean food i just know what i like and this isnt it  the service is good they bring the food quickly and theres lots of it but the marinade for the bulgogi just isnt quite right it tastes like its just soy sauce without any ginger or other seasoningsthe kimchi selection isnt what youd get in a place in chinatown and i prefer a place where i go get my own selection from a line sura five stars instead of them bringing it to me like at mothershowever if youre in henderson at the galleria and you just have to have korean bbq stop here|they are scammers beware i spent  for their services and they did not provide i have reported them to the better business bureau  and the state attorney general|this place scammed me out of  with a contract agreeing to pay them   i went to get a refund the next day after my initial appointment and they were no where to be found had to change bank accounts because they had all my information  didnt get any services from them and they wouldnt answer or return any of my calls|i honestly would give this place  stars if i could one of the most unprofessional services ive ever had in my life owner was  minutes late to my appointment said she would only be  minutes late but ended up being  minutes late not to mention that my  minute facial lasted only  minutes because she was late would not stop talking throughout the entire facial trying to sell me her products also when she was applying the facial on me she accidentally put some of it inside my mouth wtf at the end of the session she had the nerves to ask me for a tip ive never written a negative yelp review but the experience was so terrible that i felt compelled to write this do not recommend do not visit this business|this place is within a  mile of where i live i dont cook all that often and i still plan to avoid this place unless things get really desperate at home it is no longer really about the newfactor anymore in my opinion the service is quite fine but its just the quality that turns me off from ever recommending this place i ordered a half chicken salad sandwich i should mention that i am really pleased that togos posts nutrition facts and uses light mayo in their chicken and tuna salads regardless the salad itself tasted just bad the scoop was tiny and overwhelmed by the doughy bread it was served on there was more lettuce and tomatoes than chicken salad on my sandwich so it just completely tasted like a waste of any chicken salad at all what i did get from the chicken was just the flavor of salty mayo i try not to be high maintenance with my sandwiches and im just disappointed jimmy johns is a much better option if youre in a pinch for a healthy and quick sandwich|i emailed them twice and two weeks later i finally got a reply i replied and a week later still no reply thank god i thought about looking at their yelp reviews because if i hadnt i would have booked with them if they ever replied not the way to run a business|i took my iphone  in to have my cracked screen replaced  months later the screen starting freezing up i took it to another repair store that was open on a sunday  they opened it up in front of me and showed me that iphone doctor failed to put the cover plate back on lcd connection this was the cause of my iphones screen issues i had to pay to have a whole new screen put on very frustrating considering this could have been prevented if they did the job correctly the first time i would not recommend taking anything in to them clearly they dont have enough experience|i am going to agree with most of the reviews here tonight was my first and final visit to the red pot it is important to keep in mind that first impressions are indeed lasting ones  food quality selection  freshness  table service drinks plate removal etc  value price related  paying bill process and communication by management to explain my girlfriend placed her debit card on the counter and the team member went to take the card to process it i asked the team member not to run the card and that i would pay using my card he ignored me and proceeded to move towards the pos system as i asked for the nd time please do not process that card he laughed  grinned and mentioned that since she had placed her card on the counter first it was the rule that her card would be charged i asked for a final time and he proceeded to run her card anyways he mentioned soon after that he ran the card because it was similar to calling shotgun when riding with friends in the carthus her card was priority i was extremely upset by this and asked for the manager the situation was partially remedied by the charge on her card being reversed and me paying cash for the bill i was given absolutely no reason to returnso i will not return simple really |muy mal servicio lento toman la orden y se olvidan de ti hay que buscar al mesero para pedir mas bebidas lastima ya que la comida es buena|i came and ordered a few mixed drinks all were just fine and our waiter was great very friendly atmosphere was clean and nice i also ordered the scallop ceviche it was not terribly expensive between  i cant remember this is where things took a turn for the unacceptable it was served in a martini glass and included about  scallops it was hard to tell as they were chopped up it was really only  bites okay i figured it was not expensive and i know scallops are an expensive ingredient i was still prepared to be happy with it however when i tasted it i immediately detected the taste of plasticy bottled lemon juice i cannot stand anything that is made with that stuff a classy wine bar that serves  or  scallops in a martini glass as an appetizer should use fresh lemon juice|awful  the food is at best mediocre however  today we went in because mom likes it and they tried to seat us at a high top with granny who can barely walk a toddler and two yos  so we  asked to be seated near a bathroom for medical reasons and they put us in a booth that might as well have been in tucson for its proximity to the bathroom  they then said we could move for the third time  by then it was a waste of time  i ate nothing and half the leftovers that the rest of our party had are going to the dog absolutely disgraceful service  longhorn all is forgiven|my wife and i have been on a mexican food kick lately so we wanted to try this place out the atmosphere is very fun and the service is great but where the problem lies is that the food is extremely overpriced for the quality received|they locked me out of my account and then asked me to send a screen shot of my bank account then followed up with asking me to send a picture of my photo id would you like the last four of my social security and mothers maiden name next|i came here for a friends birthday and was anxious to see how this dining experience would beoverall the experience was just ok the food was good but the service is definitely lacking it may be because they just opened but i do hope it gets better i will speak about the food first the salad bar was pretty good but i didnt want to get filled up on that so i only went up once the meat was really good i have to say i enjoyed the lamb chops the most i could have had that the whole meal and been pretty satisfied as i noted previously the service could have been better as you may or may not know to be served at fogo you are given a chip you turn it up facing green to be served and turned down facing red to not be served the people serving seemed to do a good job coming around at the beginning of our meal but towards the end even if people at our table had the green chip turned up they wouldnt come around to serve usour waiter also disappeared half way through our meal and never came back usually when servers leave for the night they announce this to the table and let the table know who the replacement server was but this never happened this made it very confusing towards the end of the meal when we first arrived we told the hostess that we were there for a birthday and thought this would be conveyed to the waiter so he could assist us with a birthday dessert this did not happen so in the mist of wondering where our waiter was and waiting on dessert we were left in limbo when we asked another server when we would be asked about dessert we were given the response that they were waiting for us to tell them what we wanted for dessert since we were never given a dessert menu this would have been hard to do at this time we conveyed again that it was a birthday and they final brought over a birthday tres de leche cake this cake was very good i must say im not sure if it was because we were there towards the end of the night we left at pm an hour before close or if it is because this newly opened but i feel the service should have been better i dont think id come back again and if i did i would wait a little while for the service to improve|caf hollander tries so hard to be based on belgian and dutch roots but misses the mark while my wifes mussels were great the steak that i had wasnt my steak on the steak and frittes was cooked correctly but perhaps its my unrefined palate tasted burnt the frittes were strikingly similar to mcdonalds french fries for meatloaf steak and frittes  pounds of mussels mac and cheese two beers and two root beers it cost us  with tip heres a tip for you save your money and go to brasserie v for a real belgian experience|had a reservation for a larger table with some work friends for a holiday party the hostess accidentally gave our table away to someone with a similar sounding name we waited a while but they did end up mending the situation all would have been forgiven until i bit into my sandwich and into a bunch of dirt not little grains of sand but chunks of dirt the lettuce had not been rinsed even a little although the fries were tasty i will not be back anytime soon|wanted to try and compare to fired pie this place doesnt come close  just had no flavor red sauce very bland and topping choices are less and also just like subway at fired pie they roast mushrooms carmelize onions and more better proteinsthese pizzas seem a little smaller as wellworth a try but wont go back just a note i saw a salad being made its small|went to the dennys on signal butte and main this evening my family will never make that mistake again we walked in and were greeted and seated promptly this was the best part of the expierence we sit and then two other families are sat on either side of our booth they are greeted and orders taken while we sit with not even a simple ill be right with you we then after  min ask to be moved to another section so that we can maybe get service we are moved and the server is very nice but gets my drink wrong then brings me the coke i ordered to begin with and it has no syrup just the cabonated water yummo not we then proceed to wait another  min for inconsistant food juan ordered the cobb salad with prime rib the prime rib was cold and he didnt even eat any of the meat he also ordered the chicken soup but never recieved the soup i ordered the fried chicken cobb salad and mine didnt even have the tomatoes that juans had which is one of the reasons i ordered the salad and those of you who know juan know he drinks his drink like a fish his iced tea was never refilled and was conviently located on the edge of the table the sad part is we were not the only ones who had terible service another family with a small boy were there and they ended up leaving with thier order to go to top it all off they said they were sorry but not much else for the horrible all the way around service that we recieved there was a gentlemen there with a suit which i can only guess was a general manager but was more interested in speaking with the buss boys and giving them high fives needless to say we will never go back to dennys we are life long village inn family at this point the one great thing is that we had a gift certificate so it didnt actually cost us anything|we went there on a tuesday night for a family dinner granted we had  people but the receptionist was very rude dont think he wanted to be there that night he told us it would be a very long wait yes they were busy but he was very rude and not helpful we ended up leaving and went to macayos got seated right away  had great service and the food was great unfortunately i missed out on la pinatas great hot sauce|really bad live music last friday night  two of us went there friday theth but didnt stay as long as we intended because couldnt stand listening to female singer  singing voice was really irritating and she couldnt play guitar very well  nice restaurant and bar  needs to replace friday live music entertainment with somebody decent|like several reviewers here i have been to cheesecake factory restaurants in other locations enjoyed my various experiences and was excited to see one land in madtown butoh boythe place was hopping at noon on the monday before christmasadmittedly one of the busiest times we could have possibly chosen lucky for me my party was already seated in the bar when i arrived the decor seemed swanky and modestly cool but the first thing that struck me as i sat down was that the bar tables are far too small for a party of four to comfortably sit and eat lunch amazingly though no disasters with water glasses or plates happened during our meal the noise level was really quite uncomfortable my party had ordered nachos as an appetizer which gave me some time to peruse the menu and order quite a bit more time it turned out than i needed  minutes later the nachos arrived followed shortly after  minutes by our entrees our waitress to her credit was clearly annoyed that the food had arrived as it did back to my order it was foggy and miserable outside so i was in the mood for comfort food i am a sucker for shepherds pie which i ordered despite the misnomer shepherds herd what sheep like uh lamb cmon man ground beef makes it cottage pie but whatever when the entree arrived it looked fine albeit with an entire parsley sprig plopped unceremoniously on top i tore off some leaves and shredded them over the dish but my first bite revealed the insidious truth hiding out beneath the copious mashed potatoes and gravy wasnot ground beef not in the traditional sense you see my dish appeared to be a subterfuge for hamburger patties that had not made the cut at the grill it didnt take much for my imagination to slide to the slimy bottom of that slippery slopegaaaack many of the huge chunks of tornup patty were burnt on one side or both and all of them were quite bland which made me wonder about the quality of the hamburgersbut ill leave that for some other hapless patron to review a few vegetables had been tossed in and the mix was slathered in gravy then cleverly hidden under fluffy mounds of cheesy mashed potatoes after a few bites of this vile concoction i ate enough of the mashed potatoes to fill me upas in the part that was not in contact with the slopand left the rest there were no questions from the waitress when she took my almost entirely slopfilled plate it didnt matter because i would not have ordered anything else i was too grossed out the very idea of repurposed food makes me gagsoto recap long wait loud slow service expensive truly subpar food sounds like a job for kitchen nightmaresneed i say that i wont be back|i always see this place come up on yelp and it has such good reviews i had some time before work and since this restaurant is right up the street i decided to give it a try  i had very high hopes the restaurant is clean and i was greeted right away  i tried to order the chicken pita but the gentleman informed me that they were out of chicken and rice and i think pita too  with that being said my choices were limited  he sincerely apologized and went on to explain that they had been busier than expected  i was disappointed  but since theyre a fairly new establishment  i understand that theyre still trying to figure things out so i just bought some baklava the baklava was dry and plain  i only ate one little piece and the rest ended up in the trash  i will probably give this place another try in the future  but my first impression of them was not very positive  hopefully next time it will be better |this place sucks wtf is this a fish taco that is solely just fish and a tortilla this place is pathetic and they wanted  for twoi went back in after eating one of the tacos and the manager was kind enough to refund me for the two i didnt eat i bumped up to  stars for servicetortilla fish should revisit the recipe because the fish and the presentation of the fish with obscene large chunks as a result of no effort in cutting these that have no choice to fall out or punch through the tortilla were soggy and flavorless the tortilla shells were mushy and when i put the salsa on they immediately soaked in the salsa and broke apart at the first bite i believe that both the fish and tortilla are frozen and packaged because fresh made dont do thati understand that they do have a topping bar but it doesnt matter when the toppings cant fit on the fish taco because of the large chunks the toppings also appear to be canned products based on their taste and my experience with la taco trucks having the same toppings and nothing is fresh on a taco truck i would be shocked if these were prepared freshbecause commentors inspired me to elaborate on my experience  in retrospect i dont think  stars is deserving i would rate  but the service was okay|ok i had to give it a star but didnt want to  not usually one to complain or cry to the server even if im disappointed but the view and my company were  the best thing about my experience for what it cost you would think they would at least use fresh ingredients canned mushrooms seriously ordered and  inch received a and we were charged for  sad to say we were completely disappointed wouldnt recommend it or go back|tldr strip prices without a strip location pizza itself has fairly good flavor just dont order with mushrooms or take it to go if youre paying for the view you might as well enjoy itcame in after a run around the lake happy to see they have a twoslice lunch special unfortunately they want slice which is on par with secret pizzas pricing adding on a single topping will run you a buck a slice  for two pepperoni slices and a drink for a couple bucks more you can get an entire  specialty pie tax  tip will make it  what shark tank reject did the valuation and menu pricingopted for the featured don michele meat pizza pepperoni italian sausage smoked bacon and onions subbed mushrooms for the onions flavor was below average they use canned mushrooms which isnt in line with their premium prices they forgot the bacon listed in the ingredients and the pizza was under cooked in the middle crust itself was okay chewy not crispy decent sauce|food was mediocre considering the price food came out slowly and service was terrible be aware this restaurant automatically charged us  extra even though we left  for tip in return to minimal service received cant believe a restaurant in palazzo is doing such shifty things|horrible service we waited for quite a bit and asked for menus by ourselves the server was rude and seemed nothing professional they even charged us extra tips without our permission the food was okay but considering the service i really dont recommend it|i wish i could leave zero stars in all my many years of christmas tree shopping this has been the worst experience i went to the summerlin location i went with my  small children who was really looking forward to getting a nice tree we were having a nice time looking around and then we were approached by a very pushy sales man who was very rude and not very helpful and kept mentioning that he and the delivery people do not receive payment that they only receive tips and he was very pushy on that fact even though i  had every intention of tipping both of them i was upset that he had the nerve to keep mentioning it and i felt very uncomfortable i wanted to leave but my kids really wanted a tree that day by the way i thought it was very unprofessional that there was signs everywhere reminding people to tip the delivery men im very sure that anyone with common courtesy knows to give a tip anyway i had a small  foot tree delivered the next day because it needed to be flocked and  extremely rude delivery men dropped it off the tree it self was not very big at all if i had a bigger car i could have easily done it myself there was no need for  men so they proceeded to bring the tree inside the house and once it was done i was very polite and i handed them five dollars each one guy just walked out of my house very upset and the other guy looked down at the money and said dont you know we dont get paid and walked out of my house really fast i tried to stop him so i can speak to him but he was really angry and acting like i just tossed a penny on him i had a horrible experience with a horrible sales person who i politely tipped and made no mention to the owner because i didnt want to get no one in trouble and now i had this horrible ordeal with these miserable delivery guys they insulted me in front of my children and my guests who was over to my house when they arrived i had paid  for a measly  foot tree and they had the nerve to insult me about a five dollar tip each so i wish i could say that was the end of a really bad story but unfortunately it gets worse i decided to finally speak to the owner about all of this that had taken place so i called and i talked to a man named ricky who claim to be the manager i was so upset by the time i called him i was in tears and kindly explaining to him my situation as i am a single parent with two small children and i felt very embarrassed about what happened he seem to be very angry and upset about his workers and said that hes been getting lots of complaints about his workers practically begging for tips he seemed very polite and very upset about everything that happened and without me asking he offered to give me a credit card refund for  and i excepted his kind offer and he promised me that he would refund the money that night he said he would call me back with a confirmation  days pasted and he never called back so i called and he finally answered and rudely told me that he had spoken to the owner and the owner said that he did not want to refund the money even though ricky the supposed manager given his word then when i asked to speak to the owner he said no hes to busy and ill have him call you back then i asked what the owners name was and he told me that he didnt want to tell me his name and he hung up on me i couldnt believe how horrible my overall experience was from this miserable christmas tree farm please keep in mind i never asked for my money back i just wanted a apology he offered and lied and insulting me as well and i hope that this place never opens up again they are rude overpriced miserable liars who totally take the fun out of shopping for christmas trees its sad to know that theres people out there who are like this|meh i was less than impressed by my meal here its a cute concept but im not sure its going to make it i got a bagel my friend got a blt we both got drinks somehow it was  my bagel was clearly the kind of cheap bagel you could buy in the frozen section of the grocery store it was less than special everything felt sticky presumably from jelly however it left a not so great feeling on my hands and seat not thrilled by that i think its worth checking out but i dont think ill go back there are too many good restaurants in the area to eat like a  year old|staffed with people with a bad work ethic and bad attitudes i have had bad experiences  times there in one order they managed to screw up  times i asked for mild and got spicy asked for bbq got buffalo ask for sweet tea got unsweetened this was one order for just one person not to mention if you ask for something or point it out even the managers have attitude problems i rather drive to the one at broadway and dobson|i was told that anne gregory for the bride was the place to go for a gown  i purchased a mother of the groom gown  on sale from a  original price  the alterations were quoted at after further consideration i decided that i could purchase another dress elsewhere for a lesser price my husband picked up my dress and noticed that upon receiving the dress at home i discovered that all the tags on the dress had been removed  including the designer brand label original tags and sizethis makes the unworn unaltered dress nearly impossible to resell i found this to be deceitful as well as poor business practice mr gregory cherico president informed me that the dress was accepted as is  we were not told that the labels had been removed  i was also sent an email from the mr cherico  one should be very cautious as to what they say and write to protect themselves for liable and slander this was sent to me after i expressed my unsatisfactory experience  libel spelled wrongif the labels were left intact on my dress i would have been satisfied  as the old saying goes buyer beware  you may be stuck with a dress without lablespoor customer servicejewel desisto|great in store poor follow up delivery issues still working out delivery for our headboard which was bought over a week

the plane you might be forced to walk on the tarmac to the terminal but even if you are one of the lucky few who gets a gate with a jet bridge you soon wish you had not gotten a jet bridge  they are all old and smelly the terminal is seriously hideous carpet that is older than my grandma and ceiling tiles that look like they are going to crash down at any second not to mention the terrible lighting that makes you feel like you are in a prison next its creepy as heck that there are bathroom attendants like is this  the lack of a tram is also a real problem the near constant beeping of golf carts is utterly unacceptable finally it is unbelievably congested i should not have to walk down a concourse and run into clueless travelers and get run over by beeping golf cars carrying the myriad old people who frequent this hellacious airport furthermore the aforementioned seating is totally full thus one is forced to pop a squat on the aforementioned carpet from my assessment this airport needs a few hundred million dollars of renovation to bring it anywhere close to the other major hubs disappointing at best dangerous at worst|this is my nd visit and i am highly disappointed i visited on my lunch break and ordered a roast beefturkey on rye what i received was just turkey since it is virtually impossible for me to drive back and have them to correct the issue work lunch break this is the only way i can express how unhappy i amthey are officially on the back end of my list of best delis|the staff was helpful and the rental area is a short walk from the terminal however the car they gave me was complete garbage ten minutes into my trip the car stalled out and would not accelerate even after flooring the pedal at slower speeds the car would only accelerate after  or  seconds luckily i left myself enough time to just barely make it to my interviewwhen i returned the car and talked to the woman at the desk she even admitted that many of their cars were not working properly and i was one of many people to complain about their cars her words to me were if enough people complain maybe theyll start giving us cars that actually work tldrcar didnt work rent from them if like a gamble|have you ever read animal farm this store is the retail version of that story the management staff run around like farm animals the pigs from the book and the cashiers are slow as grazing cattle there is no sense of customer service at this store i would like to specifically call out my cashier eric for his completely poor service and ruining my shopping experience which was only further ruined by the continued horrible service i was given by the manager after i asked for one fyi there is a better kohls in kannapolis nc|i want to like the light rail i really do i even voted for it having moved to phoenix from a city with a great public transportation systemchicago and having visited other large cities with great public transportation systems i wanted this for phoenix too i wanted to live is a city where owning a car was optional  the phoenix light rail is a huge disappointment it is so darn slowinsanely slow maddeningly slow not only does it stop at every station but being at gradestreet level it also stops at the majority of stop lights too lets be honest if you own a car you will not be riding the light rail regularly it just takes too much time and time is money it takes like  times as long as just driving heck i could probably ride a bicycle fasterseriously phoenix having been developed after americans became dependent on automobiles has an well maintained  fast  freeway surface road system compared to other major metropolitan areaskudos to adot      the majority of people who ride the light rail appear to be poor people who dont own cars which brings me to my next points there are tons of panhandlers constantly harassing anyone that appears to have money and without exception every time i have ridden the light rail i have seen a knock down drag out mma style fight on the train with people recording it and yelling world star there is little to no security or police presence if you are elderly a woman or have children forget it i would not recommend it im a large male and i kept my back against the wall  head on a swivel expecting a kerfuffle   one stari dont know what the public transportation solution is for phoenix but this isnt it|imagine if you will that youve just attended an epic rock concert for purposes of this discussion lets say it was alice cooper and mtley cre you stroll across the street to a place called hard rock cafe sort of a brand icon for nearly  years you may have heard of it only to be told at  on a saturday night were actually closed now customers within notwithstanding thank goodness for the tilted kilt pub a block away which was actually willing to feed and entertain us until  amid only ever been to one hrc lahaina after this debacle i wont waste my time ever againedited to say  i appreciate the response from business manager anthony s and  the point was not so much that we were turned away  minutes before closing rather that such an establishment closes  hours

bc theres nothing lower  as someone with an extensive dental history i also found dr day to be charming and informational at the first visit  but let me warn you now to run run run  you are just another mouth in very a long line and dont let the fancy pedigree fool you  dr day is charming but my easy implant posts were the most painfully excruciating dental procedure ive ever had and when i returned due to the pain was told oh it happens sorry  it happens because dr day is arrogant and complacent  im not at all surprised by elizabeth ws postonly later would i find out that a friend had four wisdom teeth extracted by dr day to learn at her next regular dental appointment that several root fragments had been left behind and may become an issue later  wish i had known that before i agreed to use himhis billing office is a total scam so be prepared to pay far more than youre quoted  ive never written a review about a physician or dental office  because ive never felt so scammed

enjoyed a stop at this chilis once per week after pickleball  as seniors at the suggestion of one of their food servers a couple of the members of our group have ordered off the childrens menu  but  days ago we were suddenly told that ordering off the childrens menu was not allowed  i understand a change in policy or perhaps a new manager wanted to enforce an old policy  no problembut after this we submitted feedback on the chilis website inquired about what other options senior menu  smaller portions etc might be available  like any family could some of us select childrens portions as long as others were ordering adult entrees received a prompt canned response that this was an area of concern for them and a general manager andor area manager would contact us within  days  but as you might expect there has been no followthrough on contacting us oh well we made an effort to make it work but have found several other restaurants willing to meet our needs|management has a key to all units here and will steal stuff out of your apartment when you are not there  i called the police and filed a report and the officer suggested i call the home office to file a complaint which i did and they reimbursed me for  for the value of contents taken without permission|verizon has to do something about the morons supposedly managing this store i agree with the comment made earlier that they are fast food caliber at best when i asked the manager for his name he literally took his hand and hid his name  too afraid to let me know the good news is everyone saw the kind of disservice  they deliver at this store  customers and staff alike avoid this place if at all possible  trips  nightmares|omg this is one the worse airport  tsa is super slow inefficient airport itself is very old

abovementioned number  if this doesnt work im filing an fcc complaint|just had my singleworst customer service experience ever this weekend courtesy of century link ill leave the names out of this but i wont soon forget themthis episode cost me an entire friday at the conclusion of which none of the services i agreed to purchase were providedinstaller arrived on time stayed maybe  minutes she quickly determined she couldnt do the install the jack she needed to access was difficult to reach as it was enclosed in a drywall feature we inherited from the previous homeowner i offered to cut a larger access for her but she didnt stay to see if i could provide her easier access its still not clear to me if she determined a jack install was necessary or if she just couldnt get close enough to make that determination either way she left and said call back after i figured out a solutionthe minute she realized a flashlight might be necessary she had clearly checked out she was so obviously eager to leave i didnt put up much of a protest  if she didnt want to do the work i didnt want her to do the worki ended up cutting out a huge section of drywall to facilitate access to the jack i called century link back as the previous installer instructed i was told my previous order had been cancelled and we had to start over completely the installer said nothing about cancelling anything i was left with the impression that my order would remain on standby until i rescheduledthe woman with whom i spoke seemed genuinely concerned rebuilt my order and even threw in an additional  discount for my troubles i specifically requested a different installer century link agreed and even got me back on the service list for the same dayfour or five hours later we call back to see where we are on the list what do you know  were not on the list our second order was cancelled by the original installer she didnt come to see what changes i made she didnt even call she just flushed my second order sight unseen we could have waited all night it floors me that my second order was sent to the one person i asked not to come back to my housenext im transferred to someone in escalations he took his title a little too literally  i would think their goal would actually be deescalation but this guy seemed determined to really annoy me further he was immediately defensive even though i wasnt asking for anything but the services i originally requested he acted as though i was demanding he give me my first year free or something he also seemed completely unfazed that an installer would cancel an order without doing any investigating at all for all they knew i could have knocked down walls to get them access to the jack but they couldnt be bothered to checkin the end after looking at the jack and comparing it with the wiring of neighbors who have the same century link service i was requesting i dont even think a jack install was necessary it appears identical|well priced for a healthier buffet but a bland nonorganic salad bar and not enough vegan options makes this place a bit lackluster please bring in more vegan items|probably wont ever visit this location againjust watched a woman in the back making hamburgers pick up her cell phone off the counter where all the food was sitting and proceed to make a call place the phone to her ear then put the phone back on the counter with the food all while wearing gloves and then when done on the phone proceeded to make hamburgers with the same gloves on i then used the restroom and there was no toilet paper needless to say i walked out without ordering or using the restroom|i echo much of what others have said  i saw dr zenner from about  and have been seeing someone else since theni have to say first  though dr zenner was very accommodating when there was an urgent situation that needed to be dealt with immediately he was very helpful at the beginning when i was in a terrible situation and i did feel like he had my best interest at heart for the first few years i saw him for the last year or so i was seeing him ish i agree that patients were starting to get pushed through the office quickly and there is way too much time wasted with small talk and shooting the breeze  and have learned that i was being completely overmedicated and misdiagnosed  dr zenner essentially turned into an avenue to get prescriptions filled  the wait times were always ridiculous which sadly has become the norm for medical practices  you do indeed have to schedule  months out at least to even get an appointmentthough he did help me in a few emergencies i would recommend finding someone that can spend more quality time with their patients and with an office staff that could at least fake a smile|i feel like theres always something wrong with this place its the closest to my house and there not another near by so we came and it was closed due to construction okay came another night super slow then i come by and their drive thru is closed so i go inside and see a guy wiping the windows down idk if its their drive thru system not working but its always something wrong with this place love the food tho but think imma go elsewhere for burgers|they may be conveniently located but there is nothing else convenient about chase i used to shrug it off when i heard people talking about chase ripping them off i just assumed that there must be more to the story in all my years id not experienced it i was originally with another bank that was swallowed up by chase sadly now my turn has come to pass and i find myself needing to apologize to some folks the shady dealings at chase are well documented and people are still falling prey daily i guess it was just my turn im withdrawing every penny and closing my account as soon as possible|let me tell you about my experience at the spayneuter clinic this morning located on the ne corner of gilbert rd in mesa az im not one to overreact or complain about virtually anything ill start from the beginning this past monday on  i took my pugboston terrier to get spayed this particular clinic was highly recommended in the past so i felt comfortable taking her everything went fine took her home gave her the required medication that they had provided me with for the next  days yesterday i began to notice that there was a slight discharge a little pink but mostly fluid i called the clinic at around  pm and the person i spoke with said thats normal the drainage is due to her uterus removal but let me know that i can bring her in tomorrow between  am   am if im still concerned okay i kept an eye on her the rest of the day everything seemed to look about the same this morning at  am the area was completely swollen and now im extremely concerned so i rushed to the clinic where approximately  people were ahead of me i knew the drill sign in and wait i made the terrible mistake of forgetting her leash at home so im kicking myself for being in such a rush to get here so im holding her while trying to fill out the same damn paperwork i filled out on monday but im compliant and do it anyway there was a sweet woman and her daughter that helped me while i filled out the paperwork suddenly dolly begins to bleed profusely everywhere im clearly in a panic at this point so i scramble to the front desk begging to be seen sooner the person at the front desk had the audacity to say no i have to wait in line like everyone else the people behind me all back me up saying that i can go in front of them he said no thats not how the system works im completely dumbfounded by this statement and i feel as though that i may throw up i respond to him saying why does the system have to come before humanity tears are streaming down my face and im in complete panic mode because my dog is in pain and i cant do anything to help her and no one at this facility cares about the wellbeing of an animal in an emergency state because again thats not how the system works he then implies that im verbally abusing him and tells me to not speak to him in that way please note not one shred of profanity was used while communicating with this individual i begin thinking of every emergency vet in the area that i could take her to when he recommends a place to go to but they dont open for another couple of hours or i can come back at  am to be seen im sorry but what are you thinking by saying this do you expect me to improvise how to keep my dog from getting an infection due to the non stop bleeding for several more hours please for the love of god put yourself in my position for a second and understand how critical this is i said to him okay let me ask the doctor he initially stated that they said no and i have to wait in line i cant believe what im hearing he then comes back a minute later and lets me know that ill be the next in line yes thank you so i wait the next person is calledthen the next and the next i was obviously not on the top of the list at this point my sweater and my shoes and the floor and just covered in blood im shaking from anxiety and pure anger to conclude this nightmare i was seen  minutes later where they stapled her shut again and proceeded to blame me for her condition i have to go back in  days but i would rather pay another clinic  to remove the staple than to ever step foot in that facility ever again if you live in the gilbertmesa area do not support this establishment i was asked to update my review so heres an updatetheir staple on friday resulted in an infection  i had to take her to the emergency vet i tried to contact the woman from corporate but no response no one should ever support this place im disgusted beyond belief|this place is horrible the general manager is awful he doesnt care if you get your furniture or not he just cares about the sale  they promise you furniture that never arrives take your money and go some where else|this review applies only to this location two of the toms bbq places are owned by the father and two are owned by the son this location is owned by the soncompanion and i arrived for lunch companion ordered the chicken sandwich jalapeno mac and cheese a brownie and a drinki ordered a burnt end sandwich cole slaw and a drinkour first problem was that unlike the fathers locations the sons do not accept amex one would expect that in a chain using the same name the same rules would apply we found a table and in due course our food arrivedcompanions chicken was overcooked and dry some of it was left behind as being unpalatable next was the mac and cheese unfortunately it too was way overcooked with the noodles being just mush it was taken home in the hopes that refrigerating it might firm it up and at least allow it to be deep fried the brownie was the highlight of the meal being a nice portion of cake with an excellent chocolate flavor and texturemy burnt ends lived up to their name and were truly burnt having eaten burnt ends in many places before i was familiar with what they were supposed to be and the burnt refers to being seasoned and cooked twice they are not usually dry andor actually burnt i ended up covering them in bbq sauce so that i could get them down the cole slaw was excellent and seemed to be the same recipe used in the other storesthe restaurant was reasonably clean and the restrooms which are quite unusual were properly stocked and reasonably cleani was fairly disappointed on this occasion as i have eaten at other toms and never  had food like thistwo stars for a reasonably clean experience and a great brownie|well i am providing an updated review from my last one i have attached a photo of  watches in which i spent about  on each its less than  months and both are not working they are wonderful paper weights though|if your looking to have authentic mexican food then dont bother coming to elviras  they serve you tortilla chips from a bag not freshly made as you would expect  it comes with bottled salsa again not freshly made as you would also expect  the food is subpar  there were only  of us and they still got the order wrong  the restaurant was less than half full but it took around  minutes to get our food  slowwww service  our waitress didnt check on us to refill our drinks so instead the bus boy did it for us  first and last time going there|just left because me and my family waited about  mins without any server coming to our table  different servers and the host as well passed many times as if we werent even there|theres clearly a reason this place has two stars customer service seriously sucks aside from unfriendly and lack of personality and bad attitudes  they served us rotten vegetables on our bagels approximately  little slimey cucumbers is not acceptable and every table is dirty i hope the management is paying attention the parking lot is packed so its definitely not the locationits your employees|have been going here for years and gettingand loving the cornbread  however as of the st of the month they started charging  for the cornbreadbut neglect to mention thati would think if they changed the policy just a couple of weeks ago that they would now inform customers that they are charging for cornbreadwhich was free|i really will not recommend this dentist we scheduled our forst dental appointment here in arizona and we chose a filipino so we feel more comfortable his profile says speaks filipino apparently on one of his staff speaks it he did not even talk to me and he cleaned my teeth like plowing a field he did not care if he was piercing my gums the equipment is old and the assistant does not know how to polish well when i got out to discuss the quote the girl could not explain he was just saying more or less depends on what u want and you can barely understand the handwriting on paper|i ordered a dozen tamales for christmas a couple of days ahead of time and they did not have it ready this was made worse by the fact that this was not for me but for the adoptafamily program the only thing the owner offered was for me to wait an hour or take my money back she seemed annoyed that i was not happy with her options very very disappointed with this restaurant|there is no reason to make an appointment with this business every time i have shown up with an appointment time on time they clearly will take walk ins ahead of you and make you wait this is not ok when you have nothing to do but your nails they offer no reason why and leave it up to the people waiting to decide who is next by yelling whos next when you have an appointment that has passed over  minutes ago its very frustrating after this happening the last  times i have made an appointment i will not return i never have  mins to waste bc of their poor management|im giving this  stars  went monday night dec  sat at the bar i ordered an appetizer while waiting for a friend this was at pm my friend arrived at  pm and my app still hadnt arrived the bartender went to check and brought it back with her she said no one had brought it out it was lukewarm as it had been sitting there a whilei then ordered the happy hour burger with a side of onion rings side of bbq sauce mayo and ketchup the burger came plain with no onion rings the bartender never put the order in for the rings i had to ask for the mayo and ketchup as well they finally did get the rings out and didnt charge me for them the bartender apologized and was very nice the burger was very good as were the rings but the lack of attention paid left me with a bad feeling i had never been to a cheesecake factory before and wont likely be back|son muy lentos con el servicio los cajeros se tardan demaciado estubimos en cola  hora no se apuraban a cobrar|some of the worst service i have ever experienced we waited for over  minutes to have a waiter come over when i asked the hostess if we were ever going to get served she said she would let the waiter know but instead she took a to go order i will not be going back to this restaurant|this place is always disgusting  i never see anyone cleaning  the grout has black mold in the showers|dont waste your money here  this used to be a pretty good place to go for reasonable food at a reasonable price however over the past few years it has deteriorated tremendously  we stopped in for dinner received a coupon and thought wed give it another try although we were leery about doing so  we should have gone elsewhere  to our surprise the dinners have leaped up from  to  for a dinner within just a few short weeks  smacks of them taking advantage of the christmas shopping crowd for the money  out the door including tip we could have gotten a better meal at any drivethrough fastfood place and at a cheaper pricethe main offering was meatloaf the pan had a few brokenup remnants so i scraped them up and put them on my plate i reached for the adjacent pan to try some of the paste potatoes and the gal standing behind me said excuse me please  it was a kitchen worker with a full pan of fresh meatloaf  she didnt even have the decency to let me know she was there  she stood there the whole time i was scraping up the leftover bits  they also had the usual overcooked greasy fried chicken and overcooked dried out baked chicken  imho not really worth   we headed for the carvery for hopefully a better main course of roast beef andor ham the roasts looked great i asked for ham and hubby asked for roast beef  the manager was carving and i swear he can cut meat thinner than the mechanical deli slicer at the grocery store  did i say cut  i meant to say shave  the piece of roast beef was so thin and small that it would have taken two of them to make even a decent sandwich he actually shredded the slice it was so thin he had to scrunch it together in a pile in order to pick it up and put it on the plate the ham i got was such a small thin and by the way tasteless piece that i finished it in three very small bites  if they dont want to serve a reasonable portion then dont offer it at all the portions were actually embarrassingly for them stingy and insultingly small there were two parties of  people that night as well as a lot of other couples  they were very busy shortly after we got our meal and sat down they all started lining up i noticed that the manager had just pulled out a new beef roast when they all started lining up he served all  people plus the other couples that were not with the groups and by the time we finished our meal and got up to leave he still had twothirds of the roast left ohthey also had polish sausage  he served  people from one  sausage serving a very small slantcut piece to each three or four bites of the main course is to me not an appropriate restaurant offering even if it is a buffet i had a clear view of the carvery from our table and i watched the reactions of people as they were served  without exaggeration every single one of them looked at the tiny portion of meat on their plate then looked at the manager and then back at their plate a few asked for another slice which he grudgingly shaved  i swear the second piece was smaller than the first you could see the disbelief and disappointment on peoples faces as they turned away  some even smirked and shook their heads the rest of the food was just as bad  the broccoli and brussel sprouts were way undercooked the carrots were tasteless mush the mashed potatoes looked and tasted like paste and the beef gravy tasted like anything but beef  not sure what it tasted like other than gross i tried some of the corn chowder soupthey should have called it cornstarch soup the rest of the food was equally unappealing  the only reasons i gave this a one star is that a our waitperson coleen is an absolute peachalways has a great attitude especially considering she was taking care of not only our section but also the private room with the two person parties b their breakfasts are palatable if you are the first person in the door  we occasionally go for the eggs benedict  if we are the first two or three people in the door the eggs are great  after that they are nothing more than hardboiled better than another location there we were the first couple in the door and headed for the eggs benedict  eggs looked great ham bits were curled up and dried out andthere were no english muffins or sauce  they told us they were almost ready but by the time we left there were still no muffinswe will not ever go back for lunch or dinner and breakfast is not very certain either how sad  this used to be one of the few decent buffets   shame on you corporate for ruining a good thing i cant completely blame the managers  they are just following corporates edicts  we get way better at golden corral for less money|this place is has really gone down hill business is so bad that they have been forced to raise their rates their counters are over run with chotskies and the place looks to be in a complete state of disrepair the service has really dropped off as well i have been driving out to the  for my copy and shipping needs its  a shame what happened to this place|first the nearly empty restaurant at  pm prompted the hostess to make us wait  minutes for a booth  there were tons of empty places  high handed is how we read it  next we had an average mexican meal followed by dessert  the person with me could not get flan since they were still making it so another dessert was done instead  the bill came and we were charged for  desserts not two  we pointed out the problem and the server was not surprised  she just took the bill and redid it the right way  it seemed practiced  we will not be going back for a long time  the whole experience left us wanting a new mexican restaurant who wanted our business|literally spent  minutes in the drive thruthere were only  cars in front of me and i only ever saw one bag of food gothe others were drinks so annoying|worst experience ive ever had at a nail salon waited  minutes for them to fix a minute thing and then when i finally was waited on the girl cut my skin on my nail and made me bleed and treated me with no respect have gone here for such a long time but now i think ill give my business to a better salon|i am writing this not to be negative but more informative i ordered a big mac meal with a dr pepper  today for lunch at noon within an hour after eating it i felt nauseous and threw it all up and had to go home from work i have been in bed since then and i hope no one else had any kind of food poisoning|i used this office as my pcp for the past year or so and let me tell you i have had nothing but problems they tell me they take  days to get a referral and it takes months even then i have to call several times to even get them to send a referral i needed a couple referrals for different services and each one was such a giant hassle the receptionist staff sounds so uninterested and angry over the phone they never sound friendly and they sound as though they never want to deal with any issues you may have i also got some blood work done here and i was told i would get a call or receive a letter well that never happened took them  months to give me my results and i had to call them for it this office is so unprofessional and doesnt do what they say they will i have no issues with the actual doctors they are great but everything else is just a hassle and not great at all my grandmother also has the same exact issues with this office so its not just me i have decided to go and switch pcps and take my business elsewhere i will never recommend this office to anyone|heres a recent update  having returned because of a very nice manager we were unhappily surprised by changes  to wit  they have now put on the tables those electronic things where you order your food yes i know they have them at applebees and thats why we never eat there  you use them order your appetizers drinks and desserts  the only thing you order from the server is your entree  when our server showed up  after a really long time  she told us she was late because she was tired from having worked a double shift the day before  i dont care  your job is to be on time not making customers wait  then when i questioned her about the little kiosk she told us everyone has them now no they dont and also told us she didnt have to worry about her job because she was irreplaceable  really  the cemetery is full of irreplaceable people  after we ordered we never saw her again  the food was brought out by an expediter  she never even refilled our drinks or came over to see if the shake we ordered was any goodso heres the bottom line  order appetizer from kiosk  order drinks nonalcoholic from kiosk  order entree from server  order dessert from kiosk  pay with a credit card at kiosk  practically selfservice now  since the server is doing  of the work  being done by machine does she deserve a full tip  no  only  work deserves  tip  if i want selfservice ill get fast food|service is really bad food is okay   maybe prices arent great|las pupusas stan bien y el resto d la comida no sta tan mal pero el servicio es pura mierda como decimos los salvadoreos cuando llegas al restaurante miras las mesas llenas pero de puros platos sucios las meseras tienen una actitud muy repugnante y son muy pasmadas es una lastima q la duea no tome cartas en el asunto para mejorar el servicio tan kulero y mierda q dan tantito mas el curtido est muy deshabrido o sea del asco duea del local no sea coda e invierta un pokito ms en vinagre para darle sabor al curtido y la salsa ni se diga ya mejor den agua en vez d salsa est terrible tambin y d q sirve q tengan tantas pantallas si estn apagadas todas yo me pregunto si sern d adorno vale pa pura verga|i dont even want to leave one star wow i havent been here in probably  years or so a few friends wanted seafood and i remember it being amazing wow was i wrong this place was so run down i was embarrassed our guests didnt even eat their food but they hate to complain so didnt even say a thing but being a good waitress she should have noticed when only one bite was touched they werent happy appetizers sucked and were dry waitress didnt know a thing about the menu and was all over the place when asking questions lobster was chewy steak was tough i just cannot believe how much this place changed stay away ifyoure looking for seafood this isnt the spot to go|just left this pos restaurant feeling disgusted and disgusting long story short found steel wool in my food the staff was dismissive at bestoffered to void the cost after i expressed a lot of disbelief i recognize that this was a genuine human mistake but currently i cant get myself to really give a shit|bad kebabs  psychotic owner dirty chit chat the owner mr habib had us seated next to the only occupied table in an empty restaurant and served our meals himself the kebabs with rice werent good at all and we didnt finish our dish however the restaurant looks nice and neatworst part  while eating our meals the owner kept coming out talking to the two gentlemen sitting next to us in farsi and in a psychotic like behavior  they sounded friends or knew each others to our surprise he was using very very bad words and dialog in farsi in his conversation with them that totally shocked us specially when you are at a dinner table you dont want to hear words shi  and stuff like that in an iranian culture almost any culture  this is too rude and absolutely unacceptable anyway he is a very rude manplease note on the top of the very expensive bills there is a big  charge under tax this should include the  tip  as well the   tax  is to fool us to add an additional  for the tip have you paid attention to those names and locations giving this place  or  stars  either they are not much familiar with persian foods or most of them live in las vegas |one star for lack of accommodating nursing mamas  my baby had to have a procedure done in the surgical center and since im a nursing mama i needed to pump since he is unable to eat  i asked the front desk where i could go and she said the bathroom i asked if there was an outlet in there she said she didnt know well thanks for helping me how is there not a cleaner space for mamas that need to nurse or pump i went to the bathroom and lucky for them there was an outlet im still pretty upset that i have to stand up next to the sink and pump in a filthy public restroom you promote breastfeeding babies but you dont help moms that actually breastfeed longer than their hospital stay ridiculous its time to get with the times and get nursing mamas away from a filthy public restroom especially those that have to pump|the coupon is a trick we rarely use coupons so when we got here and thought oh great a free pizza with the order of any entree  we had two glasses of wine during happy hour and the lobster mac and cheese fishy foul never finished it gave the coupon yet somehow the waitress said the bill was  dollarspuzzled we asked how much the wine was during happy hourget this  they are normally   we never said anything about the lobster fishy smell and fishy flavor because we are not nickle and dimers so  for wine  for a  inch or so pizza and  for disgusting lobster mac and cheese  we didnt argue we said ok fine used our stupid coupon that lured us in and paid   being it is near christmas we left a  tip regardless thats how we arethats well above  considering the awkward circumpstances that the waitress defended this bait and lure trick she barely said thank youwe got to the parking lot and i said oh this place is getting a reviewdont go you have been warned|the only thing good about this place is the people watching from a table by the window the drinks are watered down and over priced the sushi is lack luster and the hibachi will more than likely ruin your night because youll spend all night with epic diarrhea|after read many low rates of orient kitchen located in  baum blvd pittsburgh pa  kind of feel sorry for  the restaurant the owner should review of their yelp to improve in good attitude improve their honest cooking of daily fresh foods to bring the restaurant lively instead had his son in the picture to upgrades the business there is no customer to give them the opportunity to take good pictures to get thegood impression of orient kitchen restaurant where are the value customers  none once bittentwice shy will not return but for only those not look up in yelp just walk in and hope the owner take this opportunity to keep up with changes have return walk in customers hope for the best learn their mistakes and valve the customers to serve healthy and greater foods|i used to love this place when i was growing up it was always such a great place to grab a familystyle taiwanese meal with friends unfortunately i think their business has gone down considerably since when i used to go  years ago i went the other night and ordered one of their quick dinner combo plates lobster and shrimp that came with a side of vegetables and rice the lobster and shrimp portion was a confusing stew that tasted like msg im exaggerating but i wasnt impressed and the vegetable part was this really sad portion of canned corn the food was not okay of course i definitely did not order the right dish  my parents used to order their special dishes but at the time i was eating onthego by myself and did not have time to sit down and eat several dishes also i didnt know this but they dont accept card for purchases under  and my dish was less than  luckily the manager let me slide but that policy is pretty annoying especially considering that they are located right next to a college campus which college kid who wants to grab a meal onthego carries cash anymore|im a long time nickys customer but after enduring the wrath of one specific waitress over the last  years or so i wont be returning  theyve lost a couple waitresses recently and the service has gone way downhill  youd think that after being a customer for so long id get better service knowing that theyll be seeing me again but no  this one waitress is just so terrible ive complained about her before and shes never changed  today was the last straw she wasnt our waitress though the service was not good even a little strange but my friend was returning to the table to leave a tip and crossed her path by accident the bad waitress made a comment to her about how that wasnt going to work meaning that she had walked in front of her  who does that  who talks to customers that they see all of the time like that  my friend didnt even see her coming and one of the bus boys even commented  the food isnt that great for me to have to endure her everytime so i wont be returning after today|this was my third time in a row visiting this saloni get regular acrylic fills i asked for a cut down and he refused to cut down to the length i wanted basically said he would file it down which he didnt then i got gel top coat so it would dry faster and yet it was still messed up  after he told me i was completely dry i also had several nails coming apart from my real nails which i asked to have glued or fixed it looked like he was gluing but once i left theyre still apart if i didnt have my daughter with me distracting me i would have kept on himhe had the nerve to ask me where i went to get my nails done because they were coming apart  i told him here and he and another guy did them  and he just shook his head attaching a picture of my nails  days out dont waste your time and money cost me  for a fill  for a cut down and for gel top coat shouldnt have given him |after craving sushi i wanted to check out yama but they were closed so the only spot i could remember was sushi  and boy biggest regretthe service was horrible very rude and short server i started with miso soup which was the only thing i was able to eat i then ordered the surf and turf roll salmon nigiri and a spicy tuna hand roll the surf and turf roll is grilled meat with fried tempura and the beef was so overlooked and dry it was uneditable as for the tuna what a horrible piece of tuna i wasnt even able to chew it i will not return and know there are better sushi spots in charlotte now dont waste your time and money|food the food was good my only complaint is that they use the bare minimum when it comes to there ingredients you really dont get the full effect of the thai dishes if it you want better portions  consistency this is not the placeservice i waited until my second time eating here to make my review and this is the conclusion that iv come to  the service is lacking n heres why the workers look at you like youre  crazy when u walk in instead of asking how many ppl and where would we like to sit  i also noticed that they separate the caucasian ppl from the rest nonwhite by sitting anyone of ethic background outside when theres plenty of room to sit in doors not sure how asians can be racist or bias to any group of ppl but i seen it with my own eyes they never check back with us once the food came out you have to physically track one of the workers down or go the the desk to and ask for a refill or napkins ect like i said i never like to write a bad review and always try to give the facility to make up for their lack or service quality of food and professionalism we all have bad days but it shouldnt be consistent not if you want returning customers|this was my first and last time eating here i ordered a takeout order and they told me it would be ready in  minutes i got there about  minutes later but the order was not ready i waited for another  minutes and realized that they gave the owner my order and forgot to make mine finally got out of there about  minutes after that also it was too pricey for the small amount of food i got very disappointed|after calling in september to book a holiday party reservation for  i followed up as instructed a week before the show to confirm our numbers to be told that they didnt have record of our reservation  after numerous calls from me we were pretty much told we were out of luck and were offered no severance whatsoever  in fact when i made the original reservation i was told they could only book parties of  or less but when i called to confirm and was told we were bumped i found out they took a reservation for a party of   apparently if you know someone there they will bump legitimate business for you  needless to say half of our corporate holiday party was cancelled the week of the event with nearly no apology or attempt to remedyavoid at all costs for large groups|i use to come to this place for a quick lunch or dinner i just stopped in for the first time in almost  years and wow has this place gone downhill there was no ice in either of the soda machines while the machines themselves looked like they havent been wiped off in months the soda tastes kinda funny so i ended up just doing without the drink the entire restaurant looked like it needed a really good cleaning when my dish came to me it was cold and kind of dry as if it had been sitting at the window for a while and there were fruit fliesgnats flying around my food the entire time i ate this place is not wellmanaged avoid at all costs|so essentially best buy ripped me of of a  ipad air  i returned the item aug  i had to wait around for a associate to do some technical things to it he handed me a receipt which was the one i brought in not a return receipt after not seeing the return credited on my card and the ipad not being in the system the manage said he would look ad video footage i called and called and stopping in emailed ect for months finally he said he didnt have the resources to look into it any more essentially i am being called a liar or crazy at this point i feel crazy now i have to pay  for something i dont have i guess customers are not a high priority happy  christmas from best buy|im a bit disappointed in delaneys  my husband and i went here for our last date night of  on saturday  i made a reservation for  and im glad i did as it seemed to be pretty busy with a wait  there was live music in the bar area so that was nice  we were seated and served waters right away  we were given dinner menus but drink menus werent given to us until the waiter came by to see if we wanted anything to drink  how am i supposed to know if i want anything to drink when i havent seen the drink menu yet  we ended up passing on drinks anyway so its a moot point but stillwe were served a fresh loaf of sourdough bread right away which was excellent  i ended up ordering a sirloin steak and the husband went for the ny strip  both were served with a side of potato and a side salad so we did not leave hungry  the side salads were fine pretty typical  however both steaks were served with a side of disappointment  i ordered my steak medium rare but it arrived barely pink in the center  the ends of the steak were seriously well done  husband ordered his strip medium and his was way more pink than mine  both steaks seemed to be severely lacking in the salt department  mine had a sauce on it which was tasty but the steak was still missing a lot of flavor  the garlic mashed potatoes were good its hard to mess those upi did get creme brulee for dessert and was definitely happy with that at leastthey do get points for the lovely decor the live music the service and the dessert but i cannot get over how much i did not enjoy my steak  so far my worst steak in madison|we hired merry maids to help clean our home before we sold it suzanne came in and gave us a quote and setup a date for them to come and clean when the day came to clean only  person showed up so we had to reschedule two people finally showed up the nd time and did an amazing job but supposedly took longer to clean because the neighbor came over and chatted with maids  because of this we were charged for that extra hour the merry maids shouldve told the neighbor that they were working and that we would be charged that extra hour this wasnt even told to us when suzanne came over to give us a quote this is a poor business practice so disappointing since i have used them in the past tempe office and have had no problems|im giving prime eye care phoenix one star just to be able to write  review  i never saw the doc because i choose to leave before i was even in the exam room i dont like waiting in doctors offices beyond my appointment times which is the reason i made the first appointment in the morning am and arrived at approximately am the lady tech who has to do the initial exam before you see the doc got there shortly after am  when the front desk staff told her that the first appointment was there she walked by the desk past me and two other people sitting in the waiting area and without looking back announced yea after i clean off the tornado on my desk i understand there may be traffic problems car problems etc but come on not even a look or perhaps ill be right with you  i waited about ten minutes during which time i heard her chatting with someone in her office about her trip to disney great adventure i checked with the desk to be sure my appointment was at am it was and then let them know i was leaving  i was then called in for my exam by the tech i still left the only positive note i can make is that perhaps my leaving will allow those also waiting for an exam to be seen on timesurei hate to wait but the totally unprofessional attitude of the staff member is the main reason i left  any business that provides a service yet considers their time to be more important then mine is one i will not use|i really love this place the owner is outstanding  buton a recent order and this is the second time now that my friends brought me back my favorite salad and i was not happy  they do tend to stinge on the chicken  for a big salad the chicken was barely there  just some dried out corners that probably was half of a breast chopped in tiny pieces  i will go back to eat there no doubt but i do have to address the issue because i do not have the time to run back during my lunch time  please make sure your order to go looks decent  thanks|this is the most incompetent organization i have ever had the misfortune of encountering from scheduling an appointment to having the technician complete the job it has been a comedy of errors with these folks we were told our unit would take  hours to complete and the tech finished it in around  minutes no surprise that the fix did not resolve our issue another installer came out to do it right and he arrived without the proper parts to complete the repair requiring another visit they do not honor obligations or even arrive when they say they will i only gave a  star because no stars arent allowed|i must say i think this place deserves  stars for having the item i was looking for selling it to me at the price advertisedoverall in a nut shell  i had no idea what i was walking into was not greeted and eye contact when speaking to a customer seemed nonexistent  probably pretty nice people but to walk into a comic shop for ak mags was already a bit offputting  i expect someone to speak to me with some sort of salutation and prefer not to have to assume i am the only person they could speaking to based on the fact that i appear to be the last person to walk instanding there i discovered they sell guns and are an ffl keep in mind they sell baseball cards and comics which now explains why they seemed focused on what was in front of them and rightfully so but without explanation it just appears to be poor customer service not terribly uncommon for gun stores unfortunately unless you know the owner which seems to be a common themi stated what i was looking for and a very nice gentleman was sent over to help me he wasnt familiar with firearms which wasnt an issue but there was a price discrepancy  there was a price discrepancy and the shared with me that the ad i saw online was not posted by them but they would honor it anyway which seems like an odd bit of information to share with someone who buys lots of stuff and otherwise wouldnt even know the store existed but i guess i was supposed to be thankful for the favoroverall it was okay as i ultimately got what i came for and i would have to spend more time there to determine if it is a go or a pass so ive experience better|we just had dinner at this restaurant tonight  left very disappointed  my  year old daughter celebrated her birthday here  was anticipating to be greeted by the servers this did not happen  she even specifically asked for this branch so she could be greeted on her birthday and maybe here will be better unfortunately this happened last year on her th birthday at a branch in goodyear  the food is great but the staff broke my daughters heart not once but twice on  birthday occasions to us adults it wouldnt matter but to a young girl it made her really sad  unbelievable|their icu nurses were great a few years ago when my mom was there for weeksreally top notch the er is another story completelythey have a great new trauma center so i think if youre in an accident or get shot this is a good place to go but when emergent services for nontrauma are required they are underwhelming i experienced that firsthand when my mother had to be admitted through the ergetting them to understand that she was in terrible pain and needed to be examined promptly was a chore when she began to choke and regurgitate the liquid they gave her to drink i had to tell the nurse who was standing at bedside watching passively do something help her it was bizarre as for myself i hadnt gone to the er for about  years but today exhausted after over a week of increasingly worse asthma coughing lack of sleep i wanted to avoid a  am  call i went to the er thinking a breathing treatment might helptheir automated vital sign equipment was malfunctioning and they said they couldnt find a stethoscope or manual bp cuffi asked for but wasnt given a copy of the patient information sheet they had me sign i was left to wait in their nearlyempty waiting room for over an hour and a half without any contact from hospital personnel coughing and wheezing like a steam engine the whole timemy suggestion would be if you need attention in their erhit a lamp post first in your car and complain of neck pain that way you will be a trauma patient and quite possibly you will also be able to get any needed emergent medical care for your other conditions while you have their interest|my husband got food poisoning from the lobster fried rice i called the next day and spoke to the manager  the sad thing was he kept repeatedly denying it was not from their food and saying it takes  hours before food poisoning kicks in thats a bunch of crap  it can take as early as  hours poor management will never go back please dont review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review or if youre connected in any way to the owner or employees|so i dont normally do reviews but i experienced some of the worst customer service at this location that i am astoundedi had a larger order catered for my company nothing too big  pans total  i spoke with calvin that informed me i could pay over the phone if i wanted to since online for some reason didnt have a payment option as i didnt have the card i indicated that i would call back once i did and he informed me that was fine just to ask to speak with the manager this was on  on  i called and provided the card number to the manager amanda and confirmed the details and the pick up for  am on this is where things turned into an absolute nightmare i arrived and couldnt figure out where to park and pick up the food as im new to area so i called and was provided with directions after finding the garage i was informed that i had to park in the pf changs take out spots which were all full i asked if there was anywhere else i can park and was informed they dont control their parking spots and i would need to find somewhere else to park a huge majority of this parking structure is reserved parking only mind you so i drive around a few more times without any luck i called back and asked if i could have the food brought down to me and i was informed no that wasnt an option  minutes after another  minutes of circling around someone steals a spot in front of me that had just opened up i quickly asked the lady was she going shopping and she said no to pf chang for take out i decided to wait as i wasnt finding any luck and none of the take out parking had become available i waited another  minutes and she finally came down low and behold with a pf chang employee behind her carrying her foodi finally head into the restaurant to find out that amanda had not processed the payment for the food and it turns out someone could have bought the food to my car for me as i initially asked i wasted  minutes of my valuable time due to inefficiency on the behalf of their receptionist and in addition missed the entire first half of the meeting i had ordered food for calvin handled the checkout and was pleasant i admit at this point i was so upset that i lashed out at him when it wasnt his fault the lack of knowledge and customer service i was provided was definitely something i care not to repeat and i will not be having my company return to this place of business for any future catering needs|i am a long time fan and customer of four peaks brewing since founding in   i can recall when there was no kitchen serving great food in record time when there was only a tupperware container of pretzels on the counter and just a few beers on tap including one called bubba that meant lights out if you had two  the idea that a few local guys could brew interesting beer right here in my home town was amazing to me  they were ahead of the curve on the craft beer revolution   commitment to a local brewing alternative to the corporate giants however seems to be unimportant to the owners of four peaks who have recently announced a deal with abinbev  while im sure that service at the restaurant and consistency in the brewing will not be sacrificed in the deal it is a valid concern to all those who support local businesses and local craft beer that four peaks no longer represents these valuesmy initial post on this matter was found to be objectionable not for language im not that guy but for lack of specificity in my disappointment  i have no objection to the quality of food and beer or to the level of service at four peaks  i do however object to corporate brewing entities buying up the creative little guy in an effort to recapture market share  patrons of four peaks should know that they are not getting local craft beer any longer and they should know that the profits will no longer remain in the communityreaders on yelp should have this information to better judge whether they are experiencing something that is unique and local  im glad for the guys who started the brewery they and their staff worked very hard to get where they are  as a patron who valued and supported their efforts i am disappointed in this result because it robs the product of its authenticity to be branded and distributed as something unique and special while it is now just another offering owned by an international conglomeratehave dinner there the french dip with fries and a side of ranch is fantastic  service will be great and the crowd will probably be buzzing  know however that you are no longer supporting the little guy and the profits will no longer remain local|i lived here for about nine months and i think the office staff changed about three times or more and the management changed once the apartments arent anything special and you can certainly find better quality for less money in the area my apartment had cinder block walls painted white and this weird plastic floor that looked like wood but never quite came clean when going through the movein check list with an associate i noted that there was ice built up in the freezer the refrigerator was quite old to which the associate told me that ice belongs in the freezer the refrigerator broke about a week later because there was too much ice built up in the freezer about two weeks later my ac broke in august they had also told me that there would be a dishwasher in the unit told me that explicitly over the phone and there was not i could go on but ill just say that i would not recommend living here|food is great but im giving them a  star because i just spent   at this establishment with my wife and didnt bring her here so that the illegal cholo kitchen workers can disrespect her this is suppose to be a family restaurant not a place where we cant even eat in comfort first of all if you are illegally in this country and have a job then do your job dont blow kisses and wink at customers because thats just disrespectful its already disrespect enough you are in this country management seriously needs to rethink their hiring process because i already phoned immigration for the illegal activity thats going on there so unless you want the establishment to be shut down  you should probably terminate those two cooks before they get there|i took my car in for an oil change and free fuel injector cleaning service took  hours while i waited car didnt look finished when complete i am now spending  to fix the problems created from not completing the job didnt properly fasten parts back in place gave them a chance to fix it manager was nice but did nothing but give me the run around they tried but could not execute|came here with my girls to watch sisters a r rated movie the lady at the ticket booth said we can buy tickets with one id that has a birthday stating they are  we bought our tickets and popcorn and everything then when they were taking our ticket they rechecked our id i only had my school senior idea thinking it was okay but figured it wasnt the manager gave us a refund and everything so now we are here sitting like what the heck is this|i made an appointment  months in advance and only  hours before my appointment they called to cancel i called back to try to reschedule but they only had an appointment available a month later and they had no flexibility to work with my work schedule its absolutely ridiculous lacks the compassion and diligence necessary to be a good doctors office|blacklisted for complaining once  thats how its done at gymcatson my first day i found that what i was told by the front desk was not the case  i complained i believe it was civil and respectful but made my surprise clear i was upset that the kids had no supervision and were deciding for themselves if they were going to do the drills as they ran through the circuits in one case the trainer was not in sight of the students for an extended period of time another trainer made painting a poster that would be used in gymcats advertisement part of the circuit and then down much of her time outside of the building arranging the pieces of the painting  so i complained once i was taken out to the floor and talked to in sight of over  parents embarrassing then i was told that each of my complaints was wrong despite the fact that it was happening right in front of us and i was pointing at it the front desksales person refused to acknowledge that what i was told the day before was not happening or that any concern i had was even valid i was told repeatedly that i was wrong and that the kids were having fun and thats what matters for that price i believe they should have had fun and been learning end result of complaining once owner would not have a conversation with me and i when i registered for another class i was told that i was no longer welcome there blacklisted  i didnt even know they did that they were willing to keep the money thoughdo not complain to them only talk to them if you want to tell them how very very wonderful they are they have deep egos and shallow business ethics|the place used to be so retro and fun now there is no longer any sinatra or dean martin rack pack sound track playing  the casino now only has cruise ship funky town playing or some disco musicits not nothing to do with original vegas   they took out the old school steak house and replaced it with a caf sort of deli  diner room   the slots do not pay out in my opinion just saw smally ten dollar pay outs here and there  they dont even have anyone to explain how the games work the pit boss manager guy is some grey haired older guy with a tooth pick and no personalitythe waitress are good you have to have class and tip but i dont see many others than thugs with dr drey outfits and thuggy loud mouths  with no low comps  thugville atmosphere slots that they claim pay but dont and an over all environment of the element has arrived and be carefull not to get pick pocketedthe elcortez had something but being that its trying to become the d or the golden gate or some trendy place as they always refer to their boutique quality bring back the original el cortez radio and i will return there are no speakers at the back bar why fix the place oh and if you are not a diamond member you can pay  or so for a ticket to the new years party  bartender fried glob like greazy fries and cold pork surprise or whatever it isgo a little bit better at trying to keep the decent people|they sent us to collections because they charged us for a home that wasnt ours we never received a bill or anything we are obviously going to fight this but we are in the transition of buying a home it dropped my score and is hurting my chances apparently this was a bill from a home i bought in   pretty sure i would recognize an address of a home the i bought unreal i can see why there are so many complaints one phone call to me would have been suffice and this could have been cleared a year ago they arent even considering a deletion letter for their mistake|we have been staying at the rio for many years but it has reached the level of being totally unsatisfactory and needs a total remodel  the hallway leading to our room  every and i mean every wall sconce was broken  the room   of  lamps broken drapes torn furniture had holes carpet stained safe broken etc|purchased the room on groupon that included  food credit rio is a lot more beat up than i remember  the parking structure requires you to walk outside before you hit the casino which made for a cold adventure during the winter and you can tell that there isnt as much attention to detail some lights for elevators didnt work wood was worn light fixtures in the halls were beat up the room itself was big yet adequate  double beds desk and pullout couch so big advantage of rio is that you can easily fit  adults here they did have soap lotion conditioning shampoo hair dryer and a fridge yay but no freezer section no coffee maker although overpriced starbucks next to the elevators on the ground floor the food credit was a joke since its only valid for the buffet which is around  per person or the voodoo steakhouse which is easily minimum  per person the food credit also requires you to sign up for their rewards club the biggest thing that i didnt like about rio is the required resort fee which is  per night for folks not too familiar with vegas you need a car if you want to stay here it seems close on a map but the walk from the strip to rio is far and dangerous id recommend either paying more to stay on strip if youve not a vegas regular otherwise staying at alternate offstrip hotels with more ammenities and less expensive resort fees|i am on my knees oh

last  visits i had the staff was extremely rudei was chard a gratuity of  for having small children with me who didnt eat  were in a car seat asleep on another occation my husband and i sat at the bar

party and they sat us all down and took almost  minutes to take just our drink order havent gone back since|this is the worse pizza ive ever eatenim from chicago and we use real cheese i dont know

temper is not around  i go back to the front desk to find out where she is  in the meantime she goes back to her desk and puts somebody else in line ahead of me even though i had been waiting patiently much longer  i told her that i was next and instead of showing any common courtesy or respect she tells me i have to get in line  i told her i am in line  it is her that was out if line  i say all i want is for her to do what is fair  then she just brushes me off and doesnt care at all about doing what is right  job connect has a system that is broke  when you come here dont have high expectations about this place  they simply dont care  it doesnt inspire much confidence in me if they cant even show me any respect when i first get there looking for work  they treat me like dogs  but i am a human being  even the black lady working the front desk was very rude and unkind  very uncaring and unapologetic she was extremely condescending  exact opposite if how she should behave for her particular job title these people are terrible  dont waste your time with this place|extremely rude employees also the door people at the xs club  are sexist and homophobic plus the decoration of the hotel is kind of ratchet avoid it|bad karaoke alert waited hours for our group number after we sang as a trio we were told we could not sing our solos so waiting for hours meant nothing and the same guys got up and yelled metallica  and  times for six minute long songs the worst so disappointing dont go here|when you get in the express lane without realizing it was only  items  she should have said that she only take  items or less she said she was closing and to move to the next one she should  then continue helping customers she was lying to me and that is unsatisfactory customer service you dont lie to your customer you tell him the truth she should have said to move to the next line because shes express only so im dissatisfied with this smiths store|great decor everything else was mediocre  messed up the order  didnt want to fix it for us  took a long time to get anything  will not be back|ugh pretty bad im not a super picky eater but when something sucks it sucks zero flavor no seasoning just not good at all pretty bummed that i wasted  on this|never going to this place again i found a huge clump of hair inside of the taco i ordered and the hair clump had a bug attached to it i got my food during the graveyard shift pure disgust  a waste of money  not to mention the other food i ate upset my stomach im never going to this place again and will post this anywhere and everywhere i can|poor produce selections  the lighting made me feel so depressed|if there was a zero starthats what i would give them today  tell me is this only   months from my  star ratingyesand whywould you ask am i saying barely star today  i walked over to the office to fill out a service request some gal lady sitting in the front lobby when i tell her i needed to do a service request she says what for whats wrongand truly while i feel those areimportant questions but what happened to hello oh i know this isnt jerry mcquireor hi there my name ishow are you today  and how

in the mgr office a month agothat its going to be okyoure going to love it even moretell medo i need to start clicking my ruby reds and telling myself this so i can begin to believe itsign meregretting|im giving this place star because the food was actually good but there was a fingernail in my food needless to say im done with this place|came here for dinner before we went to trop cinemas to see everest great movie we were craving thai and my bf found this place via yelp small restaurant kind of an odd odor inside i wasnt sure if it was plumbing issues or chemical cleanerit was gross whatever it was service was meh food salad drunken noodles mango sticky rice sake was meh nothing was very tasty or exciting i mentioned im vegan and yet they brought my salad out w chopped egg on top overall a meh experience not impressed i wont be returning|not impressed at all had the worst sticky bun ever|with a new niece in the family weve been visiting carters often as weve been pleased with the designs and quality of their clothing however as my niece continues to grow my family and i will be taking our business elsewhere this location has been the closest to my home but when the stephanie location opens in march  well be heading there no matter how polite i am and take care to tiptoe my behavior around the staff they have been unnecessarily rude ive held my tongue when the sales associates and the managers have spoken to me that way because i know that it wont change their behavior instead ill hold my wallet and take it over either to the stephanie store or to the north outlet store where weve received better service|i give them  stars because the food was horrible first off second half my order was wrong  and to top it off the cashier was rude|the staff not friendly and the long wait is ridiculous doctor and staff shows no concern for patients at all they dont care doctor treats patient like a number taken my son here several times to treat his teenage acne  months and no results at all his acne actually even got worse the doctor just writes prescriptions he doesnt even look at my sons skin he sits across the room from my son and diagnoses him from there doesnt even get close to him or touch his face to examine his skin dont waste your time going herei tried to complain about the long wait so they tell me to schedule p cause they just return from lunch i did that and we still wait over hrs smh|it used to be fun  they used to offer good deals to players  the buffet used to be consistently good and moderately priced  now the buffet has become far too expensive for the offerings which are now frequently cold food old food bad food  it is no longer better than others in its class and the price is ridiculous  worse the service has gotten so inferior that even as a local who has visited many times and even brought visitors from out of town may never put anyone through it again  my parents are  years old  the buffet was noticeably empty for prime dinner time during christmas week  there were literally dozens of table empty  my parents both have issues with walking  the very young and rude staff tried to seat them about as far away from the buffet as you can get  we politely asked to be moved closer  the answer was no that they did not have a server for tables closer and they would not bend on that  the rotation of servers  and keep in mind this is a buffet where servers only provide soft drinks and clear plates could not be compromised to serve customers  another server seeing the stupidity of this scene came over and said of course you can sit closer and she seated us in a more reasonable location the other host of whatever she was said we could wait  minutes for a table even though dozens were unoccupied and literally no one was in line behind or ahead of us when we came in  after the server sat us and assured us it was really no big deal for her to venture one table out of her zone to serve  year old customers with issues walking fine right another very young hispanic woman comes over to the table and adds insult to injury she starts scolding us for sitting there and even when we told her the server put us here she continued to scold us   in the future this will not happen again and you should not have been seated here and on and on and on assuming that next time we came in she would make sure we did not get good service but that we be punished for breaking the rules and apparently inciting the server to break the rules  she went on and on and when my father tried to speak she cut him off and scolded him i told her finally to get away from the table now before i called security  only then  did she back offthe food was adequate but it was far too expensive at over  bucks a pop to only be adequate  i can get that somewhere else for less than half the price  the point system for players is extremely inferior to the stations  the shrimp scampi was featured and supposedly one of two reasons for the high cost it is the exact same inferior shrimp they serve as peel and eat no flavor small not good and in short supply  the second feature is the prime rib which was not spectaculari used to really like this place but over the past four months or so it has deteriorated so quickly that i have to wonder if someone is intentionally driving it out of business  never have i heard so many customers complain about so many issues from the inflated buffet prices to the service to the fact that employees have really taken to hassling people for any reason at all  i have not repeatedly seen bartenders ask patrons to move from seats at machines where they have sunk hundreds of dollars because they stopped playing for a few minutes to talk to a friend or whatever and when no one is legitimately even there waiting to play a machine  i dont know if there was some regime change but whoever is training the employees apparently wants to offend and alienate as many people as possible  i wrote to the management and i completed a survey both telling them that the service in particular is getting so bad it actually feels hostile in there  the response was sorry you had a bad experience come back and try againfor everyone who also liked the orleans do not be surprised to find it has changed and you too may be assaulted by an employee who has apparently been trained to be unpleasant rigid and offensive|thus far i am not impressed  staying in vegas for  days and figured i would mix it up staying at  places  started at the luxor which isnt anything special but is a decent place for the money  decided to upgrade when i came to nyny to a suite  the room is only marginally larger than the room at the luxor and frankly the room at the luxor was about as nice for half the cost  at least it didnt have a broken wall safe and wall paper peeling off like it does here  additionally can i possibly be any further away from the elevator  probably wont stay here again but will stick with the luxor and just upgrade to a real suite for less than i paid here|bonjour watch out diamond star players as a member one of the perks is getting the resort fee waived so i was surprised to have been billed  per day for internet i was liable for the that charge because the wifi is only included when you pay for the  resort fee front desk staff wasnt helpful one bit and it was ridiculous my fellow yelpers arent kidding service is really rude here im not going to complain too much since i had a couple days comped but its very misleadingwhen i asked on how it could be possible to be charged for something that is technically waived in addition i have never been billed for wifi only at other total rewards properties caesars ph anywaysshe had no answer to my question and said that it was a better deal for me to pay the  instead of the  resort fee thanks captain obviouson top of that it was spotty wifilolanywaysthe room itself was on the small side but it was very accessible from the lobby and casino  my strip view was hardly a view red room th floor the casino itself has definitely aged and could use some upgrades the sportsbook is super run down crowd tends to be in the ss however location is topnotch and other major casinos are very accessible overall  the casino is definitely worth checking out if you happen to stop by for a drink or to check out some of the replicas as mentioned customer service here stinks and for the rates that these rooms go for youre better off either paying less for better value on a lower end hotel flamingo linq harrahs or just paying a bit more for a nicer room with that being said id be back but not as a hotel guestparis is very average  stars rounded down|first we had to wait for some  minutes to check in while only  of counters were open  terrible servicewhen we finally got to the reception we discovered that on top of the price we already paid through pricelinecom there is also a resort fee of  dollars which is nothing but a hidden fee and a way to mislead customers please pay attention  the price advertised is not real add at least  dollars to itin order to get in and out of the hotel you have to get through a crowded casino full of smoke parking is not easy as well it took us some  minutes to find a place|the venetian used to be my favorite hotel up until today i just found previous stuff from the last guest guest that stayed in our room im not racist in any way but i can guarantee you there are chinese   there was not enough amenities for the price of the room i highly recommend other hotels on the strip for the same price i came here for my th birthday and i was very disappointed i just wish they would go through the room a little bit more thoroughly before letting other guests stay in the room and finding their stuff|we would never eat here again the atmosphere was like an upscale coffee shop it was so loud that we could not hear each other food was mediocre and it cost over  per person we had an amazing dinner at carnevino go there instead  based on this experience i would not patronize a thomas keller restaurant|went there for dinner last night standing in line for  minutes to get food is not my idea of a good meal dirty utensils with cheap plastic glasses used over and over the same type used at much cheaper buffets the spread is vast but again quality and quantity never go together food taste was average the final bummer is the price  for a family of  adults and  kids under  years of age  expensive ripoff is more like it|when in vegas go to a buffet but not this oneso the plan was to go to the bacchanal buffet unfortunately there was a hour wait and we did not want to wait after a quick look at yelp this was the next bestway over priced  something for the buffet plus another  or so for mimosas i dont mind paying that price if the food was good or the selection was vastthe food was bland no big selection it was like hometown buffet or such establishments|i cant believe i waited in line for so long only to be greeted with disappointment my cousin and i used a groupon for this buffet so it was only  per person but that price is still not worth it selection is small and pathetic food is medicore at best the only thing i liked was the roast ribeye the crab isnt that good sorta watery and fishier than most places the desserts is lacking do not get the cheesecake ewww and i had the worst chicken fajitas ever this buffet literally has no saving grace seriously save your money and go elsewhere if my family didnt take me here i wouldnt even bat an eye at it planning to go to bacchanal tomorrow so lets see how hard bacchanal will whoop spice markets ass seriously dont come here|expensive and food are not fresh beef tastes like ages old not recommend tastes bad no idea why there is long line in front of the buffet really miss the boston maki maki must better food with much better price|if you value your stomach lining and intestines stay clear of this buffet my husband got two free meals to go there they had asian mexicanitalian meats and dessert barand salad bar i got a small amount of italian and asian then went to meat station and asked for a slice of brisket there was absolutely no meat on it just a giant slab of fat imagine the thickness of an italian sausage yes it was that thick i of course didnt eat it but what i did eat had me running  literally to the bathroom i could actually feel my intestines moving it down to the to well you all know where just thinking about it makes me nauseous ive eaten in their restaurants before this only happened there steer clear|where to begin arrived at around  after broncosteeler game on a sunday evening were seated promptly and our first waiter came right over and gave a detailed run down on the menu we had to  flag down the manager to actually take our order after waiting over  min we only ordered soup salad cheese and charcuterie plat as well as  dessertsnothing that required much prep time we waited and waited and waited finally begged the manager to bring our food all but the soups and salad arriveda good hour after we were seated the charcuterie and cheese plates were tiny  pieces of salami and a fatty piece of something the resembled uncooked bacon but was apparently duck and a cheese plate with small chunks of cheese when we again asked the manager where was our soupsalad he said he would comp our entire meal hence the one star on the review he also told us he made the salad himself not sure why but our original waiter slid by our table several times never making eye contact or acknowledging us again the dessert was goodbread pudding as was the  sonoma salad and the  soups but we were treated shabbilyperhaps because we were not ordering full entrees we had come to pittsburgh for a family holiday celebration and this was certainly a low point we also complained to the hotel next door since they two are adjoining and this restaurant provides room service to the courtyard hotel i would not recommend this place to anyone|they think they are exotic and cultured because they carry a host of european teas confections coffee spices sauces and wines maybe this effect works for the townies of champaignurbana but for anyone who has seen a world outside of the cornfields it is just products you could get elsewhere for much much cheaper this place is hella expensive for some goods which im sure the extremely snobby middleaged workers couldnt tell you much about and you could be getting at a much lower price elsewhere everything is so overpriced its actually kind of insulting their paromi teas for instance are priced  higher than their original retail price a bag of intelligentsia coffee is almost  over  for a  oz bar of chocolate not even strawberry fields has such high prices  wow wow wow they have a large selection of belgian chocolates of which i got a box for my mother who has a very high standard for chocolate who enjoyed a few of them so i will give two stars their cafe serves your run of the mill espresso based drinks on the whole not worth|im giving this a one star because the chicken needs to be fried crispy the skin was rubbery and the seasoning was light the location was clean but had a weird smell|the food was alright but some of the foods we ordered were cold and not fresh also the plates chopsticks and cups looked a little dirty later on during our lunch some other people came into the restaurant and were seated to a table close to us but they were arguing and the manager didnt do anything about it once we were done we paid our check and got our change back out of  and they still asked for a tip which was was very rude tips are voluntary and shouldnt be asked for i paid them a tip even though they didnt deserve it because im for sure not going back there again|normally we get our dailyweekly gelato fix at frost or at thats amore which is only a few miles from home however my boyfriend and i happened to be in chandler today and instead of going to frost we thought wed try gelato  bad move i normally do not post onestar reviews in fact if a business is that bad i just dont return however in this case since i love gelato and hate to have people experience bad gelato consider this review a public service announcement at pm on monday december   we walked in no one in the front of the store bad first impression eventually an employee comes to the front of the store and i ask him why is one entire gelato freezer empty he tells me that the freezer is broken i ask how long has the freezer been broken he replies over a week i then ask so i guess this means you dont have  flavors as advertised on your website he agrees nd bad impression false advertising they use to have  flavors now they are down below  flavors  very soon i guess they will have to rename it gelato  as their gelato selections keep plummeting lolanyway i ask to taste a few flavors and cant seem to taste much flavor in anything but i eventually settle on a triple cone mud pie chocolate chocolatebanana and wild berry my boyfriend is easy vanilla his vanilla was totally tasteless my flavors were okay but if comparing them to frost or thats amore then there is no comparison the reason for my onestar review is coming up so please read on when we get into our car and start eating we both noticed that our cones had large holes in the bottom even though we grabbed two napkins apiece the thin napkins were not strong enough to stop the ice cream from leaking onto my italian leather coat ironically purchased in rome italy my boyfriend got vanilla ice cream on his jeans no big deal but try getting chocolate ice cream out of leather i guess i will have a permanent reminder of this experience but it gets worsein the middle of eating my chocolatebanana scoop i notice a green  yellow worm ive included a photo of my holy cone and the worm im sure this worm was meant for perhaps another flavor i didnt eat it but im guessing it was a candy worm anyway it just totally freaked me out seeing a worm in the middle of my cone so between the holy leaking cones the worm and the stain on my italian leather coat im giving gelato  one star if you love gelato go to frost their cones dont come with holes they actually come with protective paper sleeves i love the authentic flavor at frost and when frost serves you a sample it is a very generous spoonful also i must add that gelato  advertises wafer cones the employee who waited on us told me that they have never had wafer cones  so again there is alot of false advertising happening at gelato  buyer beware|honestly i made this account specifically to review point brugge because it still has left a bad taste in my mouth i was really excited to try this place because its at the top of the list of the best places to eat in pittsburghmy boyfriend and i decided on a whim to go one friday night a couple of weeks ago its located on a cute little corner and it was buzzing with people we walked in the door and as it was our first time there we werent sure where to go all of the seats near the front seemed to be taken as well which is expected on a friday night we didnt want to look around for seats because we werent sure if we were supposed to seat ourselves so we waited for around  minutes at the door until a waitress walked right past us when we tried to ask her if there was any seats in the back she made eye contact with us while we tried to talk to her but she kept walking i thought it was a bit rude and i felt uncomfortable but i just figured she really needed to drop off the check she had in her hand at that moment however when she came back inside she walked right past us again not even acknowledging uswe didnt even make it past the door im not sure ill ever try to go back seeing as the way she made us feel like we were as insignificant as possible|the food wasnt good but the service was awful i dont complain often but the lady was immediately rude to us when we walked in she judged us right off the bat and kept glaring at us across the room i swear we arent rude people just normal adults trying to enjoy a meal she made us order more food than we wanted or she said she wouldnt service us it took forever to get us service and my friend got food poisoning this place is the worst korean bbq place ive ever been to i cant honestly say ive never been treated so poorly at a restaurant do not eat here|what happened sushi tachi used to be good but after last nights visit i dont even know if were going back to your place the nigiri sushi are packed with lots of rice felt cheated on the ayceit seems like there was some slime on the mackerel and the salmon skin hand roll is mushy inside sorry yuka we are gonna miss you very sad|no less than four ablebodied bums asking for money outside the store today  makes it very uncomfortable for a female to be harrassed when shes just trying to buy a gatorade  the circle k right across the street is just as bad because we need two circle ks right next to each other  ive even been cussed out for not giving money to someone asking|i went to this ulta to try and find makeup for sensitive skin i have a skin condition which makes the skin around my eyes very dry irritated and red the employees were very rude they treated me like i wasnt supposed to be in their store sorry i cant wear makeup all the time and my skin acts up im not an animal it wasnt just one employee who was having a bad day it was  employees who treated me like i was wasting their timenot only that but the makeup they suggested for sensitive skin was horrible for skin i looked it up later it was like none of the employees took the time to care about what they were doing employees definitely need customer service training|today is dec twenty first  and i have been without consistent internet  since november eight if a cox supervisor can see this please look at my service record there have been at least nine  calls and conversations with cox people  three techs new modem  all connections checked and still no service the last three incidents i was told  a crew will be out or call within twenty four hrs i have not had eitherif you are planning on cox communications please think again cox please call meby the way i am using my computer at work i cant use my own|i have been a cox customer for  years and i have to say the customer service i have received the past year or two has reached a new low   its unbelievable how many cox reps do not know what they are doing or talking about i have had numerous transactions misprocessed it is a given i have to call them back to get it corrected and sometimes they have messed up the process so badly it cannot be correctly oh well is their attitude  i have been given incorrect information so often i wouldnt trust a word they say  i have dealt with both residential and business and have accounts at more than one address residential is full of untrained reps and the worst service as stated above cox business is like sleeping with the devil and youve sold your soul i would never enter into another business contract again with cox  they make you sign a contract and if you try to make any changes they extent the contract under the guise of we need to get our expected revenue  i would understand this but they have gotten all their expected revenue and even after pointing this out and showing them the numbers they still wont release you from the contractwhat next i expect a cox business rep dressed like rumpelstiltskin coming to collect my first born child there should be more competition in the communications industry but companies like cox are so big they are like a monopoly and they know it so why bother giving customers any good service oh and forget about trying to deal with a cox store which years ago was a very manageable process now its a storefront and a zoo and they do not answer the phone if you try to call them say to see if they have the equipment you need in stock  no you must go down there and face the zoo|food was disgusting guacamole salsa and sour cream were all watered down food had no tasteso bland i will never return to this location the best location i have tried is on main west of power|so this place is alright i paid a very small amount of money for each night  so what can i really expectthe place is clean the bed sheets freak me out a little because im sure they dont wash the comforters which are not inside a duvet or anything our tv remote doesnt do anything but turn the tv on the rooms are sooo loud holy crap i can hear everything passing our door the worst thing for me is that the place is a little sketch at night these rooms have adjoining doors to other rooms that are locked the first night we got here someone was trying to come through that door they may not have known it went to another room i dont know for sure but it was scary i went  through  hot wire so i was paying for an unknown hotel they tell you where you stay after you pay kind of deal i dont think ill be doing that again its too much for me to be here more than one night|completely disappointed with their customer service we ordered  a family lasagna when it arrived we opened it to find  of the pan only sauce no lasagna when we called back they told us thats normal and decided to send out an extra piece when the driver returned to us he practically tossed it to me and was halfway to his car before i actually had a hold of the bag we will not be ordering from this location again the food tastes good but little ceasers is cheaper with better customer service|i got dog food from here that made my dog very sick i tried to weave out the cause and found half way threw the bag that is was the food my poor baby i didnt change type of dog food so it couldnt be because hes not used to it i called in got told to bring the food in in exchange get good dog food but when showing up i was refused you sold me sick dog food and your not gonna try and help fuck you|customers beware  i took several holiday presents to be wrapped and sent to postnet in cave creek  my gifts were returned damaged to the store  as it tuned out the olive oil had been improperly packed and it broke and leaked all over the box and the remaining gifts  the owner was extremely unhelpful  i stopped in after work to ask her to do the right thing and resend the items at no cost to me  she reluctantly agreed to do this is a very rude way  when we went back with the items she reneged on her word and refused to send them  she said we would have to wait till the claim was filed  if i could rate this womans business a  out of  stars i would  go someplace else|dr bruce has been quite good to work with over the past several years he stays up on new stuff but isnt so gung ho hes using it inappropriately biggest problem here has been staff and im moving on have left messages enough on that phony ass answering machine dont think ive gotten one response after using it you may as well piss in the wind if you need a prescription filled hopefully you care because they dont here ill transfer you|ordered here only because it was the only thing open late that would deliver boy was i sorry i wouldnt order anything from here ever again if it was the last restaurant open in phoenix not only did they take  hours to deliver the pizza was cold and also everything else we ordered damn shame|we have purchased tires here for a couple of our vehicles and experienced great service and honesty up till today  my son took his truck in for balance and a leak repair on tires he bought there  he called first then dropped off the truck  he calleda couple hours later and they returned the call that his truck was finished and good to go  when he got there no work had been done  he asked and was told it was all done but when he questioned them the rep  said the tire with the leak had an issue and they couldnt do anything l they never called and they led us to believe it was fixed  then told us we could buy new tires  we wont be back  too bad the current employees lost sight of customer service|service here used to be excellent in fact they insisted on same day appointments  you can no longer reach a human being on the phone or leave a message with a physicianss assistant  it takes hours for them to return a call if they do at all and by that time appointments are no longer available doctors have always been fine but their front office is ruining this practice|absolutely horrible customer service  i placed an order for  dozen tamales on  to be picked up on  at  pm  i then called back on  to add another  dozen tamales and move the pickup time to  pm on   when i arrived at  pm the woman at the counter told me that they sold my tamales at  pm because i didnt arrive by  pm  when i gave her the name of the individual i spoke with on  who confirmed that my order pick up time had changed to  pm and that i added  dozen tamales to my order she only provided me with my original order of  dozen tamales  when i asked for the additional  dozen tamales a guy behind the counter told me they were all sold out and werent accepting any additional orders i will never order tamales from here again|i rarely give bad reviews but i just had the worst experience unfortunately first i showed the stylist my free shampoo coupon from yelp she informed me that wasnt theirs when i showed her it was her location she told me it was corporate or another franchise and they didnt honor online coupons i said fine but she may want to look at having it removed from yelp she made a phone call to inquire further and was informed that it is a coupon they should be honoring her next remark was well apparently no one uses yelp anymore ummm i do so that was a bit offensive to me so the stylist comes to was my hair great yep  just washed no conditioner seriously i have medium length curly hair so trying to comb through it with no conditioner is almost impossible she proceeded to rip at my hair trying to comb through it i instructed her that i needed a  inch trim and i have long layers she took off almost a whole inch and just cut my hair straight across in the back nothing like its shaped horrible last i asked for a blow dry as its  degrees  nope i left with sopping wet hair never again|this place is rediculous wish i could give them a zero they are making their employees write down their customers driver license number on the receipt for any customer spending more than  and paying with a debit card they say it is to protect our privacy really how does me having to give you my driver license number protect me just look at it and make sure its me there is no reason you need to write down my personal information what happens when you lose that receipt with my personal information on it i will never return to that mcdonalds store  or any other mcdonalds location that requires me to give them my personal information just wish i had known this before i paid and they asked for my info because i would have left and went to jack in the box|worst grilled cheese ever  poor managementmenu should read sourdough sandwich  light sourdough bread  veggies   provolone cheesewhen asked by the waiter how our food was we commented that the sandwich pretty much was awful he then allowed us to write our comments on a paper which was then logged into the comment box in addition to immediately giving it to the on site manager nothing was done  no manager followed up to our tablethis item reads grilled cheese served panini style all bread so little cheese who serves a grilled cheese with no butter on the bread and there was no grilled marks on the bread as a panini would what is this doing on the menu|horrible employees  youd get better service if you walked on broken glass  pour rubbing alcohol on your feet then went to work  not a place for kids  not a place for kids|im not one to leave bad reviews but my recent experience here could only be described as simply poor customer service having been tanning at palm beach for years never have i been shocked at how a situation was handled im not going to say what happened  with whom but all ill say is even though this location is closer to me ill make the drive to the rainbow location from now on|went to this store for the first time to pick up my husbands prescription and they took forever i wait more than mins i will keep going to my regular cvs on lake mead the girl in the drive thru was nice but she just takes to long|the level of service from the sales department here is absolute crap i was working with carlos and a manager by the name of mary all day today to buy my daughter her first car  i got pre qualified and told them i would be down as soon as my husband got home from work and would be there around  or pm  i did ask them if we could put less down then they were asking its only normal to try to make a deal when buying a car anyways instead of simply saying no they went ahead and sold the car right out from under us super crappy needless to say my family will never do business with this dealership ever|went here yesterday and its end of the year the guy in charge of the beer section had let the sierra nevada beer inventory run down to almost nothing he did not seem to care i had to drive to the lees on lv blvd to find the pale ale in bottles that i wantedthey had plenty what is the point of bar code scanning at the register if the beer guy will not stay on top of his orders and inventory  he had to know that the inventory was next to nothing but he did not seem to care one bit you are losing sales and customers with this type of attitude|kiosks take a long time hard to find where to return car|feel very disappointed coming here i wanted teppanyaki and i understand i am by myself so they cooked it at the back everything was less than ok miso soup had bad seaweed cuz been sitting all day salad was not fresh worst of all the food came put so fast  was just so bad not fresh you can tell its been sitting there i mean if im going to pay the regular price why should the quality be that much less i recommend if going for teppanyaki have them cook it in front of u after all its the same price i gave  stars cuz the server a young korean guy was very accommodating  genuinely apologetic i honestly dont think ill be back unfortunately there is a place ohjah nearby that i go to and

and wanted to buy a roast to make some beef jerky  they told me they couldnt do it and i would have to come back tomorrow  i explained im very busy and could they please help me  the store manager had a really bad attitude and said no  that i would have to come back tomorrow and that was the policy  they lost the sale of probably  or more plus a customer that would have come back  with that kind of attitude i would not recommend them to anyone they are a small business and you would think they would want the business|have been here several times with coworkers for lunch this place is meh went here last week for a holiday luncheon i ordered the mahi plate the food was fair at best the fish was over cooked and didnt have much flavor being hungry and not in the mood to wait for another meal

original earl sandwhich turkey sandwich tomato soup and cheddar broccoli soup  asked for aaa discount but cashier said he doesnt know about it  he turned and asked his coworker and they both shrugged  this is my first disappointing experience ever at the earl  hope they improve their food and service in the future|service mediocre  food arrived cold and wasnt tasty totally overpriced for mexican|im here at am and it states that they are closed at am but when i show up at am they said that they are closed since midnight whether the employees ate lying to me or they need to fix the time either way its was a waste of time|the only reason i ever come to mia zas is for fundraisers its a good place for a big group of people since there are so many different optionstheir menu is completely customizable i typically do half sandwich half pizza the options are wide but the quality is not that great|except for the pasta nothing else on the buffet was good the sushi was ok the quality of the chinese food was very bad i would never go back l|the play was funny and i enjoyed it my review is based on my experience prior to the start of the performancei purchases  tickets via ticketmaster pick your seats on november th almost a month and a half before the event the total price per ticket with all the convenience fees came out to  remind you this was pick your seats not some random computer generated seats we arrived to the showroom presented our tickets which were taken rather than scanned and given back and the usher takes us to our seats as we are walking to the table i see a man sitting in one of our seats dead center stage and the usher tells us that there is going to be a live taping of the performance so we cant use that seat he proceeds to give us  seats only one of which was one of the original  purchased i told him that i wanted the seats i paid for but he said that the guy taping the show arrived last minute so what could he do to make it better i told him to go get the tickets and give us the seats but he was more concerned with the video guy who turned out to be the husband of one of the actresses in the performance we ended up sitting at a totally different table they could of compd us some drinks the guy video taping could of apologized they could of done something to make it rightwhen you pay that amount of money way over priced you expect a great experience and mine was kind of ruined from the start i dont think i would recommend this to anyone and i know that i wont be taking anyone else to see it|the service is absolutely terrible and the wait time is reallllllly inconvenient because the staff are so unorganized i literally walked in and waited at the podium for  minutes and servers were just staring at me and i was like hello will

reservations at the weirdest times the hostesses are sooooo rude here and will ignore you unless you ask them for an updatethe staff spent more time cleaning the tables while there there were probably  people waiting outside because when i was seated there was  empty tables around me the rolls are just okay but their fishsashimi was good even though the servers didnt know what they were how do you confuse a white fish with octopus  their prices for ayce are pretty standard not too cheap or expensive the quality of the food is pretty goodthe interior of the restaurant is gorgeous of course and very roomy they also have an incredible sake selection ranging from hotcold fruityto house|i been in this place  times one time was really good experience the second time i had a white guy that was

before closing it was  and they close at  seems like a fairly accurate representation of their customer service|menu  more like a list of threats  poor service  unclean counters  napkin dispensers without napkins expensive food  the only reason they turn a profit is because they prey on unsuspecting travelers   i can already tell this is going to be a looooong flightnote  fill a water bottle from a nearby fountain  |dont really see whats so good about this place order the small pho it was just ok asked for extra lime to make it taste better and got a half of a slice the little lady that

extremely rude i proceed to her register i ask for a toffee cookie she screams are you talking to me with an attitude lots of tude wth im baffled as to why she is yelling im thinking ok maybe she has a hearing problem or something but no she apparently thought i was on my phone because i had one ear piece in my ear really lady im going to ask someone on the phone for a toffee cookie when im standing in line with obvious eye contact with her smh i just dont get why she was so unhappy that day nevertheless management just needs to work on customer service with her it may have been a personality thing but im in customer service and i always tell my employees leave your attitudes and your problems in the car when you get off work theyll still be there waiting on ya but seriously there was no need for the attitude and poor customer service from her i simply just wanted a toffee cookie  thats it|service was extremely slow was about to get delivery on the table  when it came to the bill at the end was like were planning our assault on the death star and asking for a complicated flight pattern so much confusion what made everything even better is that a few people from my table last night got sick|absolutely horrible dining experience i didnt realize we had to know french fluently to be able to order the menu was entirely in french and our waiter after waiting for over  minutes to simply ask for drinks and an appetizer seemed in a very big rush to get our order as there was only two servers for a full restaurant and was very unhelpful and rude in translating the parts of menu he brushed off most of our questions it then took over  minutes for our appetizer of two tacos and  minutes for our main dishes to come out waiter never attended to us or asked if we needed anything or if everything was okay food was okay but the customer service was terrible if youre in the mood to wait close to an hour for your food to come out then this place is perfect|if you are looking to not get served food within  minutes come to this place rudest waiter named shaun took him  minutes to come talk to us and get our order took  minutes to get the food when i asked him a question he brushed it off answered something i didnt ask and left before i could continue did not ask if we needed anything or if the food was good food was mediocre do not go to this restaurant serious issues with their manners and service yikes|really not impressed i tried this place when a friend recommended it and the pizza was not very great to top it off the employees kept going in and out of the front door for no reason im not talking about leaving for deliveries either its annoying when you are sitting by the door the only table available in the whole place and its cold outside the employees were rude and the pizza was bland i wont be returning ps the in store menu doesnt make any sense no ice and no lids or straws for the cups|his show is boring nothing new and nothing exciting his acts are the same as what you already see on tv i dont know why it is associated with cirque du soleil there is no cirque in his show at all  he talks most of timeabout his childhood and how he became an illusionist i mean its ok but make it sound more interesting he sounds like he is just reading sometingwith no feelings at all lol if you want to see magic id recommend david copperfield insteadill give him  stars since ive met him a few times at work and hes really friendly warm and personable|booked room online because it was close to the airport and they had a shuttle upon checking in i ask where we parked for the week we were to be gone no long term parking  ask for refund so we could go to other property would not give a refund room was poor airplanes going over all night bed was ok much better places to stay|pretty disappointed with my first visit to us egg probably will not be coming back for  i got  pieces of dry cold french toast that butter and syrup couldnt even penetrate california eggs benedict with a tiny bit of hollandaise and over cooked poached eggs with also cold hash browns our waitress didnt check back after she delivered the food until it was too late and by then i was too hungry and just ate what i couldoverall i think they are over rated and over priced for the quality and quantity of the food served|nice shop two complaints discovered my purchase  pounds cheaper elsewhere also cattlemarket  til service trying to pay while other customers pushing by to be served maybe try supermarket practise assistant packing purchases while customer fumbles to pay while paying and packing purchases and avoids stampeding impatient customers behind|not sure whats happening here but theyve consistently been missing the mark most recent visit  reinforced this server was quite absent throughout our time there forgot to bring out drinks and then forgot to put in the order for beef tongue the sushi rolls viper and dante had major issues with the rice rice was mushy and too loose to hold the rolls together no matter how we tried to grab them they simply fell apart the beef tongue was decent but it arrived after most of the meal was finished i still love the interior but ill probably venture up the street to enjoy sushi from now on|the food is great unfortunately in the span of a month we have had  company dinners there and both times we have had food poisoning the customer service is phenomenal the food is just great good portions well seasoned the first dinner  person had food poisoning and we thought it a fluke we should try this place again because everything was so good second dinner  people with food poisoning unfortunately we will not be visiting again order with precaution|the worst laundromat ive ever been to first of all they have an awful card system that you cant understand and it doesnt warn you before it takes your money spent  dollars on  washes and  drys with should have been about  dollars they charge you to use the bathroom and the only way you can pay is with the prepaid card that they issue to you the machines work well but everything about this place is dreadful and their weekly deal and good dryers is the only thing that they have going for them the employees are also rude the old lady looked at our time and asked if that was our dryer in a very condescending voice she looks at her watch and says well im leaving here at  implying that shes kicking everyone out at  i guess thats what you get when you go to a laundromat on ave and camelback avoid this place if you arent a fan of frustration|dont join massage envy  if you dont care about your money and want below level service i strong suggest you join massage envy  i have been a member twice i guess i am stupid once is not enough  both times the management and staff lied about the terms of the agreement  they auto renew and lead you to believe via conversation that when your contract is up that you are still able to utilize unused visit  they cheat on the amount of time for visit taking you back to the rooms late and finishing early  the staff does not stay so you never have the same massage therapist more than once or twice  when you ask the therapists why the general response is they are not treated well  the desk staff is great because they are telling you whatever you want to hear  but when it comes time to deliver forget it  when you complain or ask to talk to management staff refuses to give names or numbers  there is no way to contact anyone  so if you enjoy being treated poorly tossing your money out the window and receiving only average massages  run dont walk to massage envy  they are guaranteed to rip you off while they are smiling right at you  how they sleep at night is beyond me  the whole chain should be shutdown|the staff were really nice the food though was all luke warm the ribs looked like they had already been cooked sat out all day then put back out when more needed to be replenished the deserts where good though and looked fresh however everything else was sub par  if you stay at the jw marriott they provide a  discount|christmas time its busy  i arrive at  the yelp location says they close at   just need to mail a package of gifts for my niece and nephew  nope guy says their site says they close at   no exceptions even though there are others still inside  jerk

holding a package for me since it was a few days late they said they did not have it but maybe it was being delivered had a note in my mailbox saying my package had been delivered to the apartment office the apartment office told me that the post office has not delivered any packages to them for the last  days  other people were in the office saying they were missing packages as well how can they skip an entire apartment complex for half a week at christmas time  so the package that my grandparents paid extra to have shipped priority is lost because the usps cant do  literally their only job which is to deliver the mail i get that its the holidays and its busy and wah wah wah i worked retail for many years and am appalled at the utter lack of service and accountability that runs rampant at the usps this is completely typical for them and even thought im mad im not at all surprised shut it down forever the usps is garbage|its mcdonalds what do you expect workers that believe they deserve  per hour but will get your order wrong most of the times when you decide to eat at mcdonalds you know what youre getting nothing special not healthy but its not intended to be service

the buffet off the stripthe marginal benefit of paying  for the ms buffet isnt that well worth itthe popular dishes will be the crab legs oysters prime rib and unlimited mimosasthe flan and creme brulee is good macarons are below average tastingcome here if you want to eat at a buffet but with low expectationsthe bathroom is located outside on your right|we were patients at bf for over a year we had many ok experiences however the wait time even with an appointment was always excessive  hours after our recent experience however we will not only not be going back we are filing a formal complaint with the nv medical board dr mendoza made my  yr old son wait nearly  hours past his appointment and then when my son splashed water on him from a drinking cup he threw a toddler fit and refused to see him this person should not be in pediatrics and probably not even customer service of any kind he was rude and aggressive towards my  yr old as well as my husband and yelled at them even after they had exited and were attempting to get a refund in the lobby services not rendered copay shouldve been refunded he continued to follow my husband out into the lobby and acted aggressively and continued yelling at my husband and young son to the point where my husband was concerned the man was going to physically assault him they did not process a refund even though services were not rendered and after calling their administrator repeatedly they will not even speak to us and have not attempted to make this right one week prior to this we saw dr webber and she misdiagnosed my son and had us treat him with a powerful prescription that made his condition worse and is a complete crackpot we gave them another chance after that and clearly we shouldnt have i have never personally had or heard of anyone who has had a worse experience at a medical office|donuts here are so stale not sure what the hype is about|clean place friendlyish staff im new to the waxing thing i know you cant expect every single hair to be perfectly removed i went there a week ago and got a brazillian the girl missed a lot of hair not just  hairs or  hairsand i leave   tips every time i have hair everywhere the rooms are dimly lit when i got home i was like woahhh when i called to ask for a different waxer for my next appointment  i was then informed that there was a secret service called a retouch but i no longer qualified because its been   days they should tell newbies about their policyso now i was told i have to pay for a whole new wax i promise i am not being ridiculous or dramatic my vagina looks absolutely ridiculous and unacceptable theyre trying to blame it on new growth when you can clearly tell this hair is more than a month of growth three or four of them are like an inch long then there are the tiny hairs growing which is normal but long ass hairs everywhere else looks busted terrible customer service up front the first girl i called was fine the next day a girl with an attitude problem was so rude i had to raise  my voice and pretty much yell at her so i could speak|i have been a patient for a few years and give them high marks for convenience  despite having difficulty receiving lab results and being provided with incorrect information about my care at the practice i continued as a patient because of the convenience  as a side note i have also been told by my pharmacist that this office is notorious for extended delays and the need for repeated requests to refill prescriptions   after a recent experience i am done  thanksgiving weekend i was treated at urgent care because my blood pressure spiked to dangerous levels  when i stopped by the office after my uc visit even tho they claim to see walkins i was told by a receptionist they didnt have time to see me even after i explained the uc doctor urged me to see my pcp  i was also told by the medical assistant that i could return on monday morning to have my pressure checked and if it was elevated at that time i could see a doctor  altho i was given medication at uc to use if my pressure spiked again i ended up in the emergency room  when i contacted the office on monday november  through the patient portal i received no response from anyone  my frustration building on december  i prepared a letter to my pcp and pa explaining exactly what happened including the lack of any response  to date i have heard from no one in this practice  if this is the kind of treatment you want from your doctor by all means continue or begin your care here  i value my own life more than that  i dont need the stress and frustration from an office that doesnt care about their patients  im going somewhere else|my son had an appointments across the parking lot so i decided to go check out some coins i have a few silver coins and have always wanted to increase my collection on two different occasions i rang the bell and waited nothing happened no one answered

thai food in the valley but has the worst takeout the location is always slammed and living local its nice to pickup and eat at home but after witnessing through others and first hand the servers constantly get orders wrong and then you get stuck waiting close to an hour for your food after this being my rd experience weve decided to order take out some place else|dear primanti brosi honestly can say as a life long patron i now absolutely hate the corporate fuck hole youve become ive waited a week to post this just to make sure i actually felt the same way firstly and i wont dive too far in to this end of the story trying to excuse a manager placing his hands on an employee in any way as a management style is absolutely ridiculous i have half a mind some days to return to that location and use my management stylefollowing this incident i still tried going to primanti bros to enjoy a penguins game ya know because permannys has good game specials and is a great place to watch the game negative the southside yes southside location was empty it was weird to me that there was no one there ive watched many games there before and it was never empty soon after speaking to the bartenderserver who never told us her name even when i asked she just walked away so ill just call her the hideously mannered strawberry blond i completely understood i asked the beer special she didnt know i asked if the penguins game could be put on she didnt know i asked for spicy mustard with my sandwich she assured me you didnt serve spicy mustard but then came out with it and made sure she threw it on the table to let me know she felt like an idiot man it was such a pleasant experience i cant wait to go back or ill just go to an applebees or buffalo wild wings for the same typical bullshit corporate environment it was one thing to expand to the suburbs and create the big restaurant but why would you turn the legacy stores into these spit shined shit shows so with that thank you primantis for absolutely ruining a part of pittsburgh neigh a part of my life and becoming the same sports bar in every mall shopping center next time i can at least go to a tgi fridays and know that the pens game will be on at the bar|this review is simply comparing the lv bar masa and the nyc bar masa lv doesnt hold a candle to nyc quality of food service and atmosphere is far superior in nyc lv

massive difference between salmon filets and salmon sashimi had i trusted you i could very easily be dead or in the hospital right now|i just called to make a reservation for christmas eve and i had to repeat my reservation  times due to the fact that the man who answered the phone had very broken english i completely understand and i am sensitive to the fact that most of us are bilingual nowadays however when in a business establishment especially over the phone is it too much to ask that the person taking the reservation not only listen to the customers request but also understand it at first he thought i wanted it for this evening then christmas day and then kept writing down the wrong phone number the whole experience just on the phone was such a turn off that i will be cancelling the reservation to go somewhere else sad especially being that i can literally walk there from my house|this place is dirty the soda machine looks like it hasnt been cleaned in a very long time and the bathroom is really bad toilet paper roll on the floor dirty floor i nearly feel off the toilet cuz the seat is very loose and the food wasnt as flavorful as the peiwei we go to in mesa

min to get to the front all we wanted was a regular coffee when i finally got to the front of the line the women said that there is no regular coffee anymore if youre going to be a starbucks at an airport then the lines need to move faster and also put up a sign if youre going to be out of coffee so people arent wasting their time|not impressed overpriced and they dont serve miso soup with meal

and they had maybe  others in the restaurant i will never go back to this establishment|i went here for reverse happy hour because the deals on drinks and munchies are half off but i experienced the worst service ive ever had at first we ordered our drinks and munchies and they came out right away so that was no problem the problems started when our pretzels came out and we had no plates silverware or napkins we asked our server robert to get us those items he left for  minutes and we didnt see him anywhere finally i had to walk to the kitchen and ask him for napkins we then had to ask again for plates once my friend ordered another round of appetizers she needed silverware to eat it with we had to ask again and same thing happened we didnt see him for another  minutes and had to flag him down from across the restaurant once we were ready for our bills we had to wait at least  minutes just to find him to ask for those we were smart and had our cards ready so that he could take our bills right then to possibly speed up the process we were wrong he then disappeared for at least  minutes and we noticed the table next to us getting aggravated to the point where one of the guys had to track him down to give him his bill we waited another good amount of time and could see he was just talking to someone by the kitchen this service was absolutely awful and unacceptable if you get a server named robert get seated in a different area|do not go to this place they do not know how to do nails very unprofessional and rude|if i could rate no stars for this location i would

booked myself an appointment at neil barton as a special treat having read all the great reviews i have thick curly hair so i always research any salon i go to to make sure that they understand curly hair i couldnt get an appointment with neil but i was assured that dawn was just as good as neil when it came to cutting curly hair oh how i wished i hadnt visited this salon the whole experience was terrible my hair wasnt washed properly and dawn spent  minutes chopping my hair before getting a trainee to blow dry my hair who ended up frazzling it i left the salon not only with frazzled hair but with one side longer than the other i was so horrified that a salon with such great reviews had no idea how to cut and style hair luckily for me i managed to get an appointment later that day at electric hair in harvey nichols with the lovely john who sorted out the mess on my head ladies please think twice about booking an appointment here and if you have curly hair than definitely dont step foot in this salon either go to electric hair or if youre ever down in london head to lockonego and book yourself with jonathan long who is by far the best hairdresser when it comes to curly hair|ever since this place switched over to panera it has gone down hill i have come in  times in the last month to get autumn squash soup they have been our every time and now they say they will not be getting

wanted a regular service  we had to tell them what we wanted they seemed not thrilled that we wanted more service said  the lady who did my pedicure rushed the whole spa pedicure and did a horrible job on callus treatment burnt and scraped some skin off my foot and ankle i had to ask her to be easy and slow on my foot she just looked at me and laughed  did not apologize  as she led me to her desk for manicure she was on her personal phone the whole time t kept ringing and she had to stop multiple times to answer her phone and calling back  i felt that she was not doing a proper manicure procedure cause my manicure was poorly done again she didnt ask me how i want my nails to be done  another customer sat by me was shocked on how poor customer service they gave me and my friend apologized that we had to go through this kind of customer service i never had a horrible experience anywhere else until i came to this place very disappointed|omg the place was bare shelves were empty there was nothing there ive see better selections at family dollaractually thats where im going  not recommended|had a pm reservation werent seated until close to pm did not receive our food until  we had to cancel our plans we had for after dinner and the food came out lukewarm as if it had been sitting in the kitchen for  minutes also the portions were very small for the price we asked for the manager and he acted like he didnt know what to do we rarely complain but this time was necessary he offered to take our food back and warm it up but at this point we were starving and wanted out of there he finally took  of  entrees off the bill and gave us free entree coupons which we wont come back to use ive been to the other location southside before  although it was years ago  and was never this disappointed avoid this place unless you have hours to spare godforbid tickets to a show after and enjoy mediocre small portioned cold food|bakery square ruined by christmas  went to panera bread with my son and came back to parking garage and my car was towed including my car seat  reserved parking space was poorly marked and all other spots next to the space were one hour parking   hours and  later thanks for ruining my christmas  the staff werent helpful and could have cared less that i was stranded with my baby and no car seat|food was ehhh definitely not worth the pricethe server was rude we live in the area and went during the holiday season and the server kinda ruined our visit we didnt order alcoholic beverages and the treatment from the server went downhill from there when we ordered our food he acted as if we owed him one then when our check came for  not the  required for parking he was extremely unprofessional with how he made a big deal out of it we offered to get another drink but he insisted it was more work for him we will never go back|ive been to this location x and was not satisfied with the level of customer service and satisfaction there were minor issues that could have easily been addressed and resolved such as a consolidation of gift cards price consistency and honoring an error they made  a major disappointment was the cashier not telling me the reward i was entitled to and preventing me from utilizing it in its entirety  i will not return to this location and look at fredericks catalog instead|this was is the third time we have redone a kitchen including new granite and is by far the worst experience  while they have a good selection of materials we had to repeatedly contact them to keep the project moving  they only made a template  for one area out of a total of four areas which resulted in the granite in one area not fitting in two areas they felt that filling the counter in these two places with caulking to be adequate  they promised a plumber would reconnect the sinks but eventually we had to pay the plumber  before he would do so  we would recommend looking at other granite places before settling for tintas|most horrible location i have been to by far i got the ultimate wash which is  and got into my vehicle and they didnt even wash the inside down or anything i used to go to the tempe location let me tell u night and day wont go back|i wanted a certain sofa  they said they had to order it  that was on november   its now december st  i was told first that it was supposed to be in november   since then ive called every week only to be told that it would be pushed back another week  no one has given me any answers   every time i ask to speak with a manager they take my number down and apparently throw it in the trash considering ive never gotten a call back  its almost like they are laughing at my frustration  if you order furniture from this location you can expect to be lied to and not taken seriously  i do like and want the piece of furniture so at this point i have to sit back wait and laugh at how bad their business ethics are|avoid this place at all costs ordered a platinum tacori wedding band for my fiance to match her engagement ring that i bought here as well on august th i paid half upfront to get the ring made and told them i would pay the other half on arrival didnt receive it until december th which was  weeks after the order was placedthey blamed tacori the entire time except i confirmed with tacori that capri didnt place order until november theven worse the wedding band didnt even line up to the engagement ring because they refused to send the engagement ring in and they lied to tacori about us having an engagement ringderek and faraz are highly unethical and i suggest you take your business elsewhere|service here is terrible really bad  understaffed unorganized inefficient not even apologetic verizon is ten times better been here thirty minutes no one ahead of me  sounds like employees are trying  to make friends not customers|we found a house that was listed on zillow being rented  managed by mosaic properties i should have known from the beginning not to do business with a company that is such a scam the website said the application fee per person was  but i was charged   the only reason i knew of the price change was because i reviewed my bank statement  once i was notified that we were approved i asked monica about the price difference on the application fees her response was that the prices had changed but that mosaic had not charged it on the website on top of that i was also charged a nonrefundable cleaning fee which was explained to me by monica that the fee is to have the home thoroughly cleaned upon my move out so that the next tenant can move into a clean home which i understood and would have liked the same courtesy in return but yet again mosaic failed in that aspect  the day we received the keys we went into a home that was not cleaned the home is over  sqft and it literally took me  full days of cleaning i took over  pictures that i emailed to mosaic requesting to know the name of the cleaning company and the name of the company that supposedly cleaned the carpet and refunding my money i even asked for copies of the invoices of the services till this day have not received that information and i have been in the home for about  months dont even get me started on what a poor poor job they do on completing work orders i placed a work order on  that my oven is not working and today is   i still dont have a working oven they send maintenance techs out and they come look they leave and you never hear from them again this is not the only work order that i have placed that takes more than  days to repair things if they even repair them but dont be late on your rent cause they are all over the charges i am in property management for apartments  i understand that apartments  homes are different however i also know that it does not take more than  days to complete work orders and that customer service is a big aspect in our industry and mosaic does not provide any type of customer service and the employees are rude as well  i highly recommend that if you are looking to rent from mosaic you turn around and walk away no matter how nice the home is you are setting yourself up for headaches|they were understaffed and we had to wait so long to pick up the car when we returned it they charged us extras for early return did you ever hear something like that if we did not catch it we would have paid it totally we had to wait so long for the manager to come and heshe did not show up we did not want to lose our flight so we left but it was such a bad customer service that i will never give them a second chance do not rent a car from them|they wont be around for to long with there bad costumer services i just got my card and already closed it

because its been  days since i got it is dec  i didnt even get approved  ago so for this inconvenience i asked her if she can waive the  fee and she told me no in a rude voice and ask me to take care and hung up before i had a chance to say anything lol so if they offer services like this i dont want it its bad enough its people from india answering the phones but they should be better trained|saleswoman was nice enough made me feel very rushed and made it clear she had somewhere to be also the whole place felt dirty to me i didnt feel this was a place i could have a special moment dress selection was subpar|it would be a miracle to pick up prescription in less than half an hour it does not matter what location you always have to wait|i have had one of the worst experiences with centurylink i have been getting internet service for  years in many different cities all across the united states this company is run by thievesterrible customer service  terrible technical support they lie about their specials and dont count on getting anything even close to the upload and download speeds promisedthe bill and the length of contract  will be changed to somehow make you pay a lot

service provider  this internet service provider is arguably the worst in america|mr mendoza is unprofessional and i would agree with jasmine f that he is a cocky over confident jerk on top of being unprofessional and aggressive i will not refer to him as a doctor because he does not deserve that distinction he absolutely should not be working with children|maybe someone could answer their phone or even call you back nopethey took  from me and sent some guy over to my house to measure and he took  of my other blinds and all blinds are missing and no word from anyone i have called and called

harmonic balancer so i could drive back home to missouri  i made it to gallup nm before it fell off  they charged me over a thousand dollars  had to be towed to mo where i repaired the vehicle myself in about  hours  they obviously didnt torque it down properly  the vehicle has been driven over a thousand miles since my repair and its still holding up fine  they also lied to my credit card co and said the alternator bracket was broken which caused the problem there is no alternator bracket it bolts directly to the engine block buyer beware do no go here|im really sad that i had such a bad experience here the waitress really lacked quality and was devoid of personality she had a bad case of rbf we ordered egg rolls which came out quickly but were cold they tasted fine like freezer or panda express quality the cook forgot to make our fried rice and then made it and it was delivered to our table i ordered a  on a  scale and it was ridiculously hot to the point that my mouth was burning and my chest was hurting a bit i found it to be strange and thought i just got a bad bite but it was all ridiculously hot and honestly just devoid of all flavor i was not impressedi give this place two stars because the fried banana at the other table did look quite goodthe other waitress who helped us was very kind at leasti feel like this place is incredibly hit or miss unfortunately for us we had a miss|i can not believe the experience i had tonight from this establishment first of all i called and placed my order and was told it would be  minutes an hour and  minutes later it arrived the driver did apologize and he was very nice i had a large order and a house full of people waiting to eat so when the food did come everyone was happy until i opened my dumplings which were burnt and my niece opened her combo chicken and broccoli and the rice was all dry and tasted disgusting i have never had a problem here before and i have ordered from here many times the owners name is kenny they have an auto system that shows your name and address when you call so when i called back kenny answers the phone and i said yes is this the owner the phone got totally quiet for  seconds i kept saying hello then he comes back with this rude attitude and asked me what i wanted when i explained he said oh the manager isnt here let me have him call you back um dude i know thats you kenny that is some of the biggest bs i have ever heard pretending not to be the owner so you dont have to hear a complaint from a customer you took money from and gave crappy food too unbelievable and unacceptable people reading this review please take the time to read the unpublished reviews i wish i had before i ever ordered from this place|had quite a few problems with this one late night morning staff is great we just canceled an order cause the customer service was horrible we talked to a manager i hope the service gets better i love mcdonalds but wont put up with rude people|came to get his my dog his shots one updated shot one was told the wait would be  min ok then after  min i went to see what was taking so long  they asked us to pay for the shot he needed then said we had to

establishment after looking at the reviews on yelp  we came today monday december st at about  we came in the door and noticed that we were the only customers  the waitress saw us and didnt acknowledge us and went in the kitchen area my wife went to the counter and called for the waitress in order to get a highchair   with a  repeated hello and excuse me and mind you we were the only ones thereafter no success  i then walked up and almost yelled for the waitress  by this time  i figured i didnt want the cook to spit in our food so we started to walk outlo and behold  the waitress finally came out and said yesonly if my son wasnt with usi wouldve given her more than  cents needless to say  i was very disappointed will we be back the next time were in the lv area but of course but only when bulls start to give milk|we stayed here last night for our anniversary and booked a spa package with our room it was supposed to include a massage for each guest after having the massage and about to check out of the hotel they informed us that we had to pay for one of the massages we went to the front desk to talk to them about it and they were very rude and had terrible customer service they said that since we hadnt clicked on  guests in the room when we made the reservation that we couldnt get the  massages even though upon check in we said  people were staying the night and gave both names on the registration of the room the supervisor even said my husband hadnt added the second name upon check in which was a total lie the wording on the package was very deceptive and i am sure they try to have loop holes so as you dont get what you think you are getting and after youve already had the massage its too late and you leave being charged and extra  for the second massage which should have been covered under the package deal im very upset by the package not being what we thought it would be but not only that the girl at the desk and the supervisor were very rude and even at one point started typing things into the computer and i asked what she was typing she said what does it matter of course it matters because it pertains to me terrible customer service not even an im sorry this didnt go as you had thought it was supposed to they acted like we were trying to cheat them out of a massage when we were only trying to get what the promotion package stated one massage per person in the room if  people in the room that is equivalent to  massages needless to say they wouldnt budge and we left upset and mislead we will not be staying at the talking stick resort ever again and anyone reading this shouldnt try to book any package promotion|i chose two stars because youre not allowed to bring in weapons which means no concealed carry it was also distracting being able to see other screens you should put up some sort of walls so customers can only see one screen at a time exiting was confusing|inept is the nicest word i can use here  the age old fe error code  came on in november a tech came out about a week after the initial call was made he told us we needed a new motor and control panel we had to wait an additional three weeks for another crew to come out they installed the new motor and did not install the control panel stating these are reconditioned unit best to stick with the factory one looks like it works fine barely had they left the driveway when the error code came back now to go through the bullshit gauntlet of getting a tech back out herethis folks with a warranty this also after we replaced the motor a year after we purchased the machine and it ruptured a hose connection that flooded our kitchen|hostess started off by saying what to our party of   took  minutes to even place our drink order and the food

polishing  and the buffer fell on the hood resulted a one inch dent on my aluminum front hood    he apologized had me pair up with the dent guys to remove the dent  the dent guy said he could not get it  percent will out drilling a hole from the back of the hood  however the paint is indented and where the dent was you can still see it   mario tried polishing it but its visibly clearly a damage of the paint  this damage was not suppose to happen when you drop you car to get a ceramic coating  he rectify it giving me  percent off  i was going to bring my wifes mercedes to get the coat done but not anymoreeven around the lug holes of the aluminum wheels were scratched from when he removed the wheels  this car doesnt even have  miles or had a tire rotation donei do not recommend this business

need to have a better supply i will also say the food is good but that is far overshadowed by them running out beer i want|cigarette filled roomworst managementive never wrote a yelp review but after my stay at this hotel this past weekend i had to create an accountthere was a very large group of us staying at this hotel for a wedding upon checking into my room late friday night i noticed a very very strong cigarette smell in the room we had booked a non smoking  queen room room  i went down to the front desk and notified monet of the smell she stated the guest that had arrived prior to me had already told her about this we returned later that evening with no changes to the room the following morning i spoke to monet about this and she said they would come check out the room and finally did after asking three times when i asked if there was a manager i could speak with she simply replied nope  her attitude being one of the most condescending i dont care attitudes ive ever seen as a staff member someone did finally spray our room which didnt help at all we had beautiful dresses in the room for the wedding which now smelled and i even had to hold my nose in the shower the smell was so bad after numerous complaints to the staff where i stated i would not be paying full price for this room not once was there an apology or offering to come up with a solution monet could not care less about our commentsout of the  or so guests i spoke to that weekend about the hotel each had an equally horrible story to tell about monet ie its not my problem that you booked a  queen bed and we dont have one available if this hotel actually had a manager onsite they would see how horribly she treated us she should be fired immediatelyupon checking out on sunday the new staff memeber at the desk had the nerve to state no one in our room had mentioned of this smell until now and it was their understanding that we had been smoking in the room needless to say this did not go over well with me i am now dealing with marriott corporate on this issuewhat was supposed to be a fun wedding weekend turned into one with more issues at the hotel then ive ever dealt with if you ever have an issue at this hotel know that it will not be addressed and they dont care about you if staying on the southside go elsewhere  like the hyatt house down the street|i came to this location to purchase a couple of gifts for christmas with a friend as it turns out i had forgotten my wallet with id but didnt realize until i was at the check out the manager ken was called over and provided not only the worst customer service ive experienced in a while but he was argumentative and had a seriously bad attitude about the whole thing he actually told me to go ahead and go to another location or another establishment i was happy to go get my id and return since it was completely my fault for not having it however after the way we were treated im not sure ill ever want to return to a total wine i had never been to a total wine before but they certainly didnt provide me with any reason at all for coming back i recommend for anyone to go anywhere else liquor world is one of my favorites or lees liquor even ken definitely needs a new job or maybe just a class on customer serviceupdatei returned to total wine with my id an hour after to prove a point and to get the gift i wanted to get the cashier didnt ask for my id at all i paid and left way to be consistent total wine|very rude raced passed me in a gated development then i stopped to take a pic of his vehicle he jumps out and

not a mixed drink can someone explain that|i was in the other day to purchase  handguns i was trying to find one for me and my wife in the same caliber i was talking to the salesman for a minute and a

pizza and it smelled horrible already this morning  should never get sick from cheese pizza|highly disappointed our friends came down from california for d fist time since weve moved here and we researched this place because we love steak and my friends knows a lot about beef being his from wisconsin we ordered the ribeye and it lacked flavor i pour salt on that steak so much that it made me just plainly sad to have in front of me a great looking and cooked steak with no flavor at all the salad had hardly any dressing i had to ask for more and  to top this off we got home and within a few hrs my husband and  friends were vomiting and were exploding from all ends and my both rooms and even tubs and sinks were destroyed  luckily for myself besides a bad tummy pain i was spared from vomiting bottom line is that we paid a pretty penny for a great meal and experience and it gave us food poisoning sunday december th|for a first timer it was crucial they are too fast and literally

friend and i purchased retried beans and tamales at murrieta store and both ended up with severe food poisoning  purchase was made o december    buyer beware|i really wanted to like this place as i have celiac kiddos eating out does not happen much for us i dont recommend this place for celiacswe were seated with no problems for an early lunch i really feel the problem lies in the menu itself many foods have gf options but things like french fries are fried in a common fryer there is no allergyfree fryer so when something is listed as being gf you have to check with the server for example you might see chicken tenders with fries   gf however we were told that the chicken tenders would have to be baked and we would have to choose the fruit option instead of the fries why not list or sell the fries a la carte instead since it is not gf after being in the fryer the kids menu is small and with the fries option out for us that didnt leave much except for the adult meals also my kiddo asked for a plain cheeseburger along came a hamburger with lettuce and tomato seriously we sent it back and they added the cheese took about another  minutes dont get me wrong everything tasted delicious however  hours after coming home my celiac kid is sick i am not sure if it was crosscontamination or if they gave him the wrong bun but we wont be backi guess this is one of those places that is only catering to people who feel they need to be gf but not medically inclined disappointing i will stick with picazzos or even red robin for a cheeseburger|my mom ordered the duck noodle they gave her only bones my beef brisket was sliced so thin prices are way too high service is bad this will be my first and last time there   for a bowl of beef noodle what a joke|let me first say that after all the raving reviews we came really excited to try this place out also the buffet is beautiful with a wonderful ambiance that is definitely better than most other buffets like the bellagio which was really stuffy unfortunately however it was quite the disappointment first of all the hours say pm but when we came around pm the chefs had already stopped serving some of the food namely the make to order seafood station which we had been really looking forward to getting additionally as we were eating we could see the chefs and waiterswaitresses cleaning the restaurant at around pm well before the noted closing time this wouldve been understandable around  or pm which is closer to the actual closing time but to be completely honest this kind of ruined the otherwise wonderful ambience as well as our overall experiencealso the gelato flavors were dwindling really quicklywhen we came in only  of the  flavors were remaining and by the time i was getting dessert around pm they had only had three flavors leftand they werent refilling any of the flavors with  hours left of the buffetfinally we were incredibly disappointed with the salad there were only two salad options  small bowl of lettuce drenched in ranch dressing or  a quarter chunk of ice berg also drenched in what looked like either blue cheese dressing or mayonnaise personally i wouldve liked to see a make your own salad barnone of us are a fan of dressing and prefer being able to choose our own vegetables toppings and dressing if any quite frankly salad bars are quite a buffet staple and we were really disappointed by its absence at this buffetall in all for the price of this buffet  per person for dinner this buffet was incredibly disappointing none of us got to eat the make to order seafood plate even though we came in well before closing time the service was subpar and there was a sadly surprising dearth in the variety of food available namely how quickly they stopped serving the seafood lack of a salad bar and dearth of gelato we got the feeling from how early the chefs stopped making new food and how slowly they were making it that they were slacking off and from how quickly the waiters started cleaning around us that they just wanted us to finish eating and leave as soon as possible dont get me wrongthe cleaning and everything wouldve been perfectly understandable around  or  but given the fact that we came  hours before the closing hour and how long wed been waiting in line around an hour or so we were kind of taken aback that they had already stopped serving a lot of the food by the time we got in for one of supposed best buffets in vegas the wicked spoon definitely fell short of our expectations|had a package  day priority  it said that it would arrive   on website it was to arrive  and then change to dec  and now  dec  no box i went to post office on december and they said  it was with carrier on route   now carrier came by no box and he said he doesnt have it  great way to not guarantee your delivery i paid  for priority delivery in  days  and now kid gift not going to here when we needed it   they told me to call if not here by monday dec   and now on  minutes waiting for them to come back on the phone bad customer service|the blonde girl cailyn or caitlyn im not sure how you spell it because she was the only employee not wearing a name tagis the most incompetent person i have ever met and her attitude is beyond unacceptable she is very unprofessional and should not be allowed to talk to customers|first of all we like to go to local places we see on tv  we never got around to going here because it just seemed like another bar with a famous name  and really thats what it is  there are two areas the bar and the lounge for want of a better term where theres a stage dance floor tables and boothsthe alcohol selection is typical for a locals bar nothing special  they do carry tenaya creek beers so they do get  point up  we didnt try the food so i cant comment on thatwe were there with some old friends for a concert  the tix said  but the act didnt go on stage until  and we had to go to work in the am so we didint get to see the showin fine its a local watering hole but not one that id travel across town to go to again  ill stay on the east side|be aware of this company the  admin staff is rude and unhelpful along with threateningon  occasions they have made errors in billing and sent notes like the burden of proof is on you i dont know about you but companies that say things like this to customers when errors on billing has been made in the past watch outthe driver was great but ever since they have your goods in their possession it has on gone down hill  additionally i signed a  month contract and paid  month locked in pricing even though have had my items stored with them  years and i requested to have annual pricing since i have been there so long and their response was   oh wellthere are many other vendors that are in the portable box storage businessi recommend going elsewhere where you business is appreciated|poor service terrible food soggy and undercooked no understanding of the problem took  minutes to get an undercooked pizza had our money refunded the food was so terrible|i have ordered from these guys a few times each time something was either missing or incorrect i have never been satisfied with their food soggy wings soggychemical tasting pizza and really awful burgers and pasta i also hate that they need to take a copy of your card to run it only place i know of that does this if you like cheap bar food that lacks flavor and horrible customer service this is the place for you|wowzers wait for it i was on a road trip with my  year old brother and got tired and wanted an affordable place to stay the night i had intentions on hitting the road really early so a real laxed telly just wasnt what i was looking for so this place drove me on its price cool the night guy was pretty nice he let me pay cash butthe room he gave us was pretty bad we got a queen bed with a pull out couch after trying to settle in my brother freaks out because theres a heroin needle in the couch yea picture to prove it the bathroom was gross and smelled like bo and i dont know what so obviously i had to ask for another room the guy was really embarrassed and said absolutely heres another room i was so tired i just wanted sleep well after tossing and turning because the sheets and everything was just gross after  hours of sleep i got up and was ready to go so was my brother he didnt sleep very well either there was a new older guy in the lobby and after asking to check out he mumbles something that i cant understand after asking a couple times what he was saying this ass hole says oh your the one who found the stuff  excuse me found the stuff yes i found the shit and its fucking gross extremely dissapointed  in the way this hojo handled this the guy even tried to snub me my  deposit this place needs alot of help and renovating the staff needs some help with customer service too the least the guy could of done was apologize for the horrible experience on finding the stuff the rooms suck too theyre gross without the needles but i guess u get what you pay for step it up guys its almost  smh|i wanted to try this after seeing all the great reviews so  today i headed over  it smelled funny when i walked in nothing is labeled and no one bothered to explain the menu i ended ordering something i didnt want because there was no explanation of the menu items and no one working spoke english well enough to have a conversation withfyi if you go here go with someone who understands the menu to guide youi was a little worried that i made a huge mistake but despite not ordering correctly the food was very good  it gets two stars for poor service and lack of product labeling  im not psychic if you dont label the menu and the salsa how am i to know whats spicy and whats not i ordered meat lovers tacosfyi no choice of meat with that when i tried to ask about making a selection the service person looked at me like i was a stupid gringanext chips and salsa but if you want a mild salsa you have to play go fish nothing is labeledi am not inclined to visit this place again|this place is all around mediocreit feels quite dated and the menu is quite scattered the food was okay but the presentation could be bettermy biggest complaint is the service which could be a bit nicer over the few times ive been here ive noticed the staff can be quite impatient with youi wouldnt go here again by choice but if you need to eat in this area and are out of choices its not the end of the world to have a meal here|wow i dont know what happened to this place the worst dining experience ive had in a long time orange juice   cappuccinos took  minutes to come out and the capps were barely warm food took  minutes after drinks came out  a la carte waffle chix  waffle breakfast sliders everything came out on hot plates with cold food butter wouldnt melt on cold waffles slice of cheese on sliders was not melted syrup was water chix had that old smell sent food back and left horrible never eating here again|autohauzaz stocks a lot of parts but they use a ups gimmick called ups innovations to save the customer money on shipping that service is nothing more than a bin that ups infrequently collects from and then hands off to the usps for delivery it adds up to three weeks to your delivery time this trade off isnt explained on the website customer service will matteroffactly tell you that after youve been expecting it for two weeks if you want the part faster dont bother ordering it again from them theyll process the order on the following week when they get around to it and if you want the part dont criticize their laziness theyve got enough business that theyll just cancel your order oh and if you ever actually receive the first order that gets to you slower than the proverbial slow boat from china think twice about returning it after shipping it youll be charged a restocking fee|would not recommend going here for your hardware needs multiple times i have asked an employee to help me find an item only for them to tell me they do not carry it when i look for the item myself it is sitting right on the shelf customer service is much better at home depot carl at centennial home depot gives fantastic customer service and helps you find everything you need|cant be counted on to be open during hours posted on the door twice in the last month weve tried to eat here on our way to symphony hall and they were closed even though the hours post stated otherwise saturday my wife called to see if they would be open at  pm on sunday and was told yes until  pm she and her friends arrived at  pm only to see a sign saying they closed at  for their christmas partyfood and service is always great but have a backup plan in case theyre closed|i normally give the benefit of the doubt busy short on staff but i came in only looking for a couple of quarts of oil michael behind the counter didnt seem to be in the best of moods so i really didnt try to strike up a conversation he rang me up and i gave me the total and swiped my card i then asked if he was going to ask for my rewards customer number which i use quite frequently so i know the process he begrudgingly said i normally would ask for it when its not busy i believe i was one of two customers in the store so he had to reswipe my debit card again so i would get credit for the transactionjust a reminder if you dont say it they wont always necessarily do it i cant speak for other employees just for michael|since they have such a big following they treat the customers very indifferently i am a senior and picked up the tab for my sons family i did not eat since i have strict food restrictions  they refused to give me the senior discount since i did not eat a meal in very poor taste  i live across the street and will not go back not will my family|i have no problem with their selection i have a problem with their customer service however i went looking for a specific item that i could not find amongst their shelves and when i asked the cashers about it they simply shrugged their shoulders and gave me the i have no idea look so i said ok ill just take this bottle of wine then go ahead and check me out to which my cashier proceeded to chat with customers in the line next to me with her head turned away from me and handed me my receipts while still talking to those customers and i had to get my own bag and take my receipt from her fingers i will be sure to go to bevmo the next time i need to purchase any sort of alcoholic beverages or accessories where we always experience good customer service|trust and honesty are in question i have been to this salon twice both times i was charged and paid more than ten dollars over listed charges i have short hair i dont need much work i never ask for extras i was told that individual stylist charge different from the listed prices some charge way more than other stylist in the same salon when asked who in the salon went by the listed prices i was told they didnt know well if they dont know then say this is a baseline suggestion of charges and they dont really follow this guideline bottomline they do good work personalities are all over the map cost is anyones guess|soo not impressed not worth the money i took some friends for sunday brunch had a great server service was on parbut the food the food i had the avocado omelet i had a side of hash browns a waffle and a side of bacon  the omlete did not inspire me to even take a picture  it wasnt well presented and the taste was just okaynot even great tasting nothing i could not have made myself  barely any avocado in it  the hash browns were horrible too salty and not even hash browns more like smoshed country potatoes  waffle was good but thats almost impossible to mess up the bacon was soggy and not crisp like i requested  and wayyyyy too greasy they didnt even blot off the excess fatone my friends there said the french toast was way too sweet one friend ended up with peppermint toast she did not order it she ordered the regular onesaid it was fine i had their coffee and a bloody mary coffee was good bloody mary was the worst  thank god it was not a  bloody mary i would have been pissed the cost of the meal overall was too expensive for the quality of food they served|horrible food i went here last night with a couple of friends the food was below average the calamari is clearly frozen and comes in a bag they only have the rounds for that reason im sure the pub fries were pathetic i only received the ends and they were burnt and oily i will not be back save your money|save your money and time and dont visit duckworths not worth it my mother and i visited duckworths today after hearing my mom rave about the blue cheese chips from her prior visit we were greeted and seated very quickly and professionally our server attended to our every whim and was about the nicest waitress ive ever had the pleasure to have wait on me howeverthere was a problem with the water i ordered a water and it had a plastic dirty unclean dont drink this taste to it i have a well on my property that goes through  stages of purification to get it to taste good so i know bad water when i taste it this water was the nastiest water ive ever tasted the waitress began to say that it could be the ice cubes providing the added dirty flavor and proceeded to bring me fresh water with no ice cubes same horrible tasting water my mom then saw one of the general managers and flagged him down she simply and nicely said that my water had an odd taste to it and asked if it could be a dirty water filter that needed to be changed the manager was very rude to us stating that well we change our water filters pretty regularly so i doubt thats it he then walked away and came back  minutes later stating i tasted the water and its fine in a rude snappy voice i politely said well it could just be my taste buds then he then walked off in a huffy manner no apologies no offer of complimentary drink nothing our waitress then began to tell us that she hates the water there because of the flavor and only drinks soda when shes working due to the waters flavor other than the fight about the water with the rude manager the food was okay fries were very good but everything else had just a eh kinda flavor and taste to it it certainly wasnt deserving of the money we spent on it basically it was just cheap and poorly made drunk food save your money and time and go somewhere else|if youre looking for horrible customer service but nice uniquely decorated  rooms than this is the place for you the front desk ppl are not welcoming at all they also tried to over charge us they were very unorganized  unpleasantly rude i stayed for  days  i could barely get any sleep due to their loud music bumping throughout the day  night i stayed on the ground level until i found  baby roaches in my hotel room then they finally moved me to the second level it wasnt as noisy  i didnt discover any more roachesthank goodness but overall the rooms were very nice  uniquely done up but the service was very shity so on that note i will never ever return back  i wouldnt recommend anyone to go there as well|i didnt know whether to watch a movie or make a conference call dont get the tabletop seats it has all the charm of watching a movie at kinkos|i can not believe the hateful message and intolerance of these people regardless of your religious affiliation straight or gay do not support these ignorant people homophobic intolerant unprofessional and just plain rude please do not support hate|awful awful aweful this was our first time eating dom  demarcos and we got  large pizzas and garlic knots for carry out i understand the pizza is supposed to have a char but these are burnt beyond belief and the crust is hard as a rock and inedible  i called and the manager said i could have  off my next bill seriously  i would never

my engagement ring and wedding band  we got engaged in october  and i went in for my first cleaning in april  it was done at chandler and the man who helped me was completely rude and barely spoke to me the whole time  i went to the scottsdale location in october and figured i would get my rings soldered and have them inspected at the same time  after waiting almost half an hour while they attempted to look up my records from chandler unbelievably slow system and i dont really understand why they couldnt just call the other location they finally agreed to solder the ring and inspect it  this month december i had a stone fall out of my wedding band and went back to the scottsdale location  they said they had no record of the october services rendered and that i would have to pay for the repair of the stone  they kept asking if i had it done at the chandler location as if i was an idiot and couldnt remember two months before very upset why did my husband pay the extra money for a warranty if this company does not keep records|we were extremely disappointed just a few minutes ago when the longest dim sum meal ever finally concluded  it was just under  hours  it was about half full when we arrived but for some reason though seated within  minutes of our arrival it took  minutes for someone to ask if wed like something to drink and then another  for tea to arrive  first cart had dirty linen and dishes  we werent interested  the nd and rd carts had the same type of items   minutes after sitting down we finally had some dumplings  they were served steaming hot and smelled delicious  unfortunately without chili sauce or chopsticks we were still waiting several minutes  they were quite yummy even several minutes later when we were able to eat them at lasttwo carts had some stuff we wanted and finally made their way by us but there was apparently no way to make that known without breaking health code laws or assaulting an elderly woman  but in choosing not to snatch items off the cart with my grubby little paws as it whizzed past or tackling the lady and taking what i wanted by force we decided by default to go relatively hungry  the time honored practices of pointing smiling gesturing and nodding that have proven so effective in the past were useless here todayas things started to fill up more carts came and there was enough in the way of food that they just went up and down the aisles as opposed to skipping the nonchinese speakers who didnt couldnt call them over from the other side of the roomat this point we were about an hour and a half into our meal and the frustration of not being served in a timely manner and wishing someone was around to even ask to refill our water was subsiding as we were finally eating and it was quite good  this next point is an equal praise of the food as it is a knock on their service the food was fantastic even though what we ate had been on the cart and gone for a ride around the entire room several times for at least a half hour before we could get our mitts on itan hour and forty minutes in and we were done  quite honestly we could have been down an hour earlier had they served us in a timely manner  it took  minutes to bring us a check  i put in my card  it quickly disappeared   minutes went by  we got a dirty look from the hostess as they were now jam packed  a few minutes later she asked us if we could please leave because we had finished our meal and so many others were waiting  i indicated it had been  minutes since someone took my card  she gave what felt like an insincere apology noting only its so busy to which i responded it wasnt busy an hour and a half ago when we started waiting nearly a half hour for our very first cartanother  minutesmy husband went to track down my credit card  he stood there several minutes while everyone scrambled at the back counter to open up every menu and bill pay folder around them   minutes later he returned very frustrated with my cardthe frustration that had subsided once we were fed came back with this end of the meal hoopla  the supervisor couldnt or wouldnt do anything including just sincerely be sorry which is what i wanted more than anything  while i would have like a concession of some sort quite honestly just sincerely being sorry for the lousy experience would have gone a lot further  unfortunately all we got was attitude from the supervisor and i sensed though i could be wrong that she thought i was just trying to get a free meal or trying to bully her with saying i would go on yelp with this experience  unfortunately it was a pretty horrible dining experience one which doesnt match the food at all  victor was wonderful as always  as such we signed the credit card slip and i made sure to snag a pic with my phone indicating that we were leaving no tip so that if one mysteriously appears there in the future i can more successfully dispute it with mastercard  as victor has always been wonderful and took care of us today as best he could even though we werent in his section i went over to him and gave him  cash and thanked himfood  stars easilyservice   star and thats quite generousits rare and sad that we say goodbye to one of our favorite places  unfortunately with the lack of service today we just cant go again|i will never go back again and i will tell everyone not to shop or use the range  gun garage everyone there was very rude a group of  tourist drunk came in and was able to not only use their range but fire fully automatic rifles very unsafe and unprofessional i recommend to every one  find a different range its vegas plenty to choose from|worst sushi ive ever tried the location of emzy is good right under the duke energy center the decor inside looks like they are in the middle of refurbishing it the staff are disinterested and werent helpful preferring to pick their nails the sushi was warm when we got it so we sent it back and walked out do yourself a favor dont come here|ordered the basil flavor dish with chicken for lunch pretty terrible the chicken was soggy with a clumpy sauce tasted like a reheated microwave meal service was good no complaints there i doubt ill give this place a second chance|i never write reviews but mekong just delivered the worst excuse for chinese food ive ever tasted in my life i wasnt expecting anything out of this world but i expected at least mediocre i ordered over the phone and was never told my total i tried to ask but was hung up on after giving my card information the food took about  minutes i spent  minutes on the phone with the driver giving him the same directions over and over he finally arrived and was angry with me over my direction giving i had told him which main drag to follow and all the street names as well as landmarks i signed the slip for my beef lo mein and  shrimp roll although the cost was more than i expected i was starving so i signed tipped and sent the man on his way firstly they gave me  veggie egg rolls i had ordered only  shrimp roll they were doughy and only contained lettuce i then tried my beef lo mein i did not eat the beef as it wasnt cooked and the noodles and sparse veggies were flavorless i spent over  to throw my dinner in the garbage can absolutely terrible do not waste your money here|i would love to give lees a  but the girl behind the counter was friendly  however the food was at best a  nothing at all that stands out and the value for what you get was next to zero  for example my wife ordered a large orange juice and it was a sixteen ounce orange juice and it was given to us with  oz of ice and  oz of orange juice  when i asked the girl if that was the large she said she was only allowed to put  ounces and had to put the rest ice   i have never ever had orange juice with ice   thats the old filler trick there were no sides even offered as options other than drink   long story short dont waste your time or money at lees sandwiches  you can do much better in all areas almost anywhere else|ive been here a few times as i generally try to shop in independent bookstores when i can it is worth noting that the prices are generally  times what youd pay on ebay or amazon for the same book and that the interior of the shop is incredibly dusty many of the books are in poor condition or dirty with much of the selection appearing in no better condition than what one might encounter at goodwillhowever the most recent visit which prompts this review was certainly more troublesome than some dusty booksi arrived at this store and heard some cacophonous goingson at the back which turned out to be some kind of event in which bands and solo acts were playing there was a guy behind a counter collecting entrance fees and when i asked he said that the  cover would be going to a battered womens shelter that seemed rather decent so i bought a water  and went inafter the first band playedwhich was basically awful but being that it was probably two high school kids not entirely unexpecteda youngish harpie took to the stage to tell the assembled masses roughly  people what our donations were paying forshe commenced to thank the crowd for its support of their cause and it that point i found out this was some socalled anarchist fundraiser having been unacquainted with the local expressions of this movement beyond the odd foodnotbombs participant i was somewhat surprised to see this type of organization convening in the rapidly gentrifying area of phoenix in which ive chosen to make my homethe harpie then cajoled us further to participate in some activity she called the shame wall no not the wall of shame it was not that clever and encouraged all listeners to come and engage her and the others at some information table to learn more and get involved upon getting a closer look i confirmed that this shame wall was an exercise in slander and libel whereby any individual male female or other might anonymously accuse another of a range of transgressions ranging from thoughtcrime divergence from the observed leftist kant to aggravated rapeapprising this individual of the risk of prosecution at the hands of someone that would be slandered by this use of their donations i asked them to either take it down or return the entrance fee that i paid as i didnt want to support something that is both legally and ethically wrongas well as hateful and mean spirited at this point the girl became agitated and said that to seek protections for the accused is just as bad a rape itself and that no one is ever falsely accused of rape and that the very concept of a false rape accusation is simply the seeds of doubt sown by the running dogs of capitalism and oppression etcat this point a crowd began to form as the harpie continued to escalate and raise her voicedemonstrating again that when an authoritarian leftist says she wants to be heard she wants to be obeyed at the threat of social exclusion and defamation  we attracted some attention of the anarchist groups leader recognizing the contradiction obviously who handily carried in a set of chairs next to the shame wall so that we might sit and begin a dialogue neither the harpie once agitated or myself saw any point to this with the young woman setting her sights on some sort of win so that she might end the conversation settling finally on the goal of denying me the  refundturning to leave i instead appealed to slight boy man that i had paid a few minutes earlier no refunds he said and the anarchist turned out to be an enterprising little capitalist of the type not seen since pt barnum as you came and heard the music and then had a conversation continuing you ruined the eventthis poor confused little boy his unread bakunin likely gathering dust in the shop while he thumbs through tumblr believed that my refund request had ruined their anarchist club event well the little bastard has probably never seen a print of picassos guernica to think that the worst thing an anarchist might encounter is skepticism or disbelief also what kind of anarchist has a  smart phone and a credit card reader that he can attach to it to collect donations from my massive conglomerate bank was lawn gnome entitling this anarchist club to legitimately conduct business under lawn gnomes permits charging of entrance fees and sales of water etc is the anarchist organization or lawn gnome a registered charity as the girl promoting the shame wall promoted it as one on stage what standards are being applied to the above charity organization to ensure funds are not mishandled what is the involvement of lawn gnome has lawn gnome secured live music permits for these anarchist fundraisers why is lawn gnome so dusty inside with its surly employees so unconcerned with the labors for which they are presumably compensated|service food environment drinksbar price we came here for an anniversary dinner on a fairly busy weekday night we did not have reservations but were still seated immediately the inside of the place is incredibly well designed a modern version of rustic elegance we found ourselves at several moments throughout the dinner stopping our conversation as our eyes would catch random decorative features that we enjoyed the servers hosts and management were all friendly and attentive comparable to other experiences at similarly pricedrated restaurants in las vegas nothing mind blowing there our favorite part of the evening was by far the drinks from the bar we had a pimms soda and an hk antioxidant the food sadly was incredibly disappointing all around in total we ordered caesar salad tomato heirloom salad shrimp cocktail gnocchi and the beef wellington you have to order the beef wellington at grs restaurant right maybe we should have followed our stomachs and gone with the incredible looking steak cart instead of following our brains to the wellingtonanyway the food was all incredibly bland the wellington especially had no specific flavor and the gnocchi had an incredibly blanduneventful sauce for the name id expect a lot more than this for the price i definitely better get a lot better quality id come back here and enjoy a drink at the bar but definitely wouldnt return for the food|nothing special  ended up in this place because rusconis was closed  employees look miserable and have zero customer appriciation|gordon ramsayesque review  looks like someone took a crap on my plate  it taste like it tooputting it gently three years later gone are the crowds and for good reason the food has become shockingly badto start the once good oxtail chili cheese fries has become a disgusting mess  stringy over braised oxtail meat stewed in excessive quantities of cheap taste like dirt chili powder then slopped atop soggy fries  an overcooked rubbery egg with almost no yolk processed cheese wilted cilantro and shriveled rubbery jalapeo peppers round out the dish   noto the patties used for the burgers yes adding a little sauce in the raw mix adds flavor  adding too much makes the meat wet with an odd texture and causes the burger to break apart when eating  the toppings lack freshness and now pass sauces are so heavily slathered on the flavors are completely overpowering and off balance  epic fail for the kalbi burger patty fell apart kalbi marinade and ko chu jang mayo dripping everywhere  the spicy miso burger not far behind it too oozing some sweet miso concoction mushy meat falling out with almost no toppings except a hardened piece of cheese in the center of a apple vinaigrette soaked bun  no and noservice is off the strip friendly and fast but with only three other tables at peak lunch hour it better bemaybe bachi on bachi for one of the owners cowardly acts ehrin watada first commissioned officer in the us armed forces to refuse deployment to iraq  maybe just trying too hard to up the ante in asian fusion flavors  either way not recommended|this was the worst food we have ever ate in las vegas it took  minutes to get our entree and it was awful we sent it back and ordered something else and it was just as bad complained to manager and she offered a free dessert we declined im sure it was as bad as the rest of the meal|dont waste your time  tried the crepes a holiday cookie ice cream and coffee  nothing special  crepes were mediocre  kids all took one bite of the cookie and claimed it tasted strange  most of the cookie went in the trash  not worth the wait the calories or the trouble of figuring out which line goes where|this was the worst experience ive ever had at a restaurant the food was good but the servers actions was as if she didnt like us she would not check on us to see if we needed anything and when we did ask her for assistance she was extremely slow to move and her attitude was not pleasant at all i would like to blame her being busybutit wasnt that busy|i was looking for a specific car that this dealership advertised on the internet it was in phoenix and i live in sacramento i fly for free so it was a minor time inconvenience to buy a used car in phoenix  the car was advertised with a special internet price with a few bold side notes one of the side note was that the price is valid only if you finance through them otherwise it is  more i called the sales manager from sacramento and i asked him why that is i told him that i have my own financing he said that that is the deal and asked if i want to see what rate i get qualified for he got back to me in writing saying that my interest rate is     i did not get back to him the next day i flew to phoenix on an assumption that every deal is negotiable i told the new sales person that i do not want financing and he gave me the same internet price with financing involved he gave me the runaround that what he quoted me were just numbers anyway the financial person wanted me to sign their finance deal right away i said that is not what the new sales person made me believe anyway i refused to make the deal or pay  extra for my own financing the owner got involved saying that i knew before i came to phoenix what the deal entailed i agreed that i knew but everything is negotiable until we all agree on a final deal i even offered to pay  extra about the internet special price but he refused and walked away it is his right to do as it is my right to express my disappointment in the dealer not to negotiate even  very inflexible i walked away and now i am on my way back to sacramento|absolute worst attitudes from these employees every

said yeah but didnt break it down at all i just paid the over priced charges to get out of there im not coming back|im leaving no stars the food is average at best the major issue with this restaurant is the service as an indian restaurant i walked in expecting below average service the service i received was horrendous we were a party of  and the meals came out one at a time about  minutes apart i ordered chicken tikka masala and garlic naan i got the chicken and rice with no naan when naan finally arrived the chicken was cold oh and there were only  small cubes of chicken in a large gravy boat update management contacted me about the service issues and has given me a satisfactory response im sure they will work to take care of the issues from happening again|i came here yesterday with some friends we all order a croco burger  decided to start with an apprizer took the nacho plate  what a disappointing and sad looking plate i got i posted a pic so you guys can see what they are selling for almost  it was just a plate of burnt chips even when the waitress gave it to me she had a face of shame on her  it also took  mins to make some how good this is they took it back when i told them how disappointed i was and did not charge me  another bad thing is we got almost no service my friend wanted water and no waiters was to be found till they brought our food  the only reason why they even got  stars cuz the burger was all right first time ate it was better but it was still fine this time  if you want to eat at croco grill skip the nachos go for the poutine or burgers or skip this place all together  im going to give them one more try for the poutine  made my own nacho plate at home going to upload it to show them how a noob can make a better plate for less then they charge|the vegan burger is amazing but the service is horrible i have returned so many times hoping for change  sadly i will have to forego the amazing burger  its not worth the rotten mood that accompanies the poor service|i heard quite a bit about this restaurant and had high hopes for it but unfortunately i was disappoint in the food noodles were soggy and i feel like top ramen would have been a far better choice the service was good which is why im rating this  stars|worst place everhookah sucksssservice is terrible the guy literally told me not to come back if i was not happy seriously  not

restaurants here in vegas with the exception of this one i spent over  for two and ended very disappointed with the food that was presented to us fish and chips tasteless rack of lamb salty the only thing that was good was the draft and local beer that we ordered overall visit was disappointing and the evening was ruined good luck to all those who may attend here|first off the nachos will be the only reason why i come back the burgers were average and the corned beef sandwichlets just say i had much better at a local deli for a third of the price the staff was friendly and the atmosphere was pretty cool but overall take your money elsewhere except if youre going for the nachos disappointed in gordon|tried to take my boys there twice around  and the crew told them they were closed also

entertained and i have regrets every time we go the service is horrible every freaking time yesterday we went with our family from out of town it was pretty embarrassing not enough waters were brought out for the table no cream came with the coffee chicken and waffles were toddlersize portion we got the wrong filling in one of our breakfast burritos and our server had to be hunted down to get a refill on coffee i want the restaurants in tempe to be great i hope this place improves its service the food gets better and becomes a little less sloppy overall because i really love that duck pond and i want to eat delicious food and have basic service while i sit next to it|second visit here and now i know why it took us over a year to return  at first owner was pleasant and nice showing off their pirogi machine to my family  appetizers meat pirogi with mushroom sauce and stuffed mushrooms came out very quickly and were very good  our server seemed to have his mind else where as every time he came to our table to get drink orders or check on us he was busy looking everywhere else which made us wonder if he heard what we said  we ordered our entrees famous seared scallops jager schnitzel ghoulash stuffed chicken  all were good until we came to the seared scallops they were cold inside  when we finally got the servers attention he took the plate for it to only be returned with the owner  she was very very argumentative and kept insisting they were cooked properly and that is what seared means  she kept touching them and showing me look they are cooked i touched them and said yes they may be cooked but they are cold  well thats how we serve them was what she kept stating over and over again  she did say they were cooking some more well done ones for me and at that point i told her no thank you  i didnt want them  my family finished with the other items they were okay but nothing that was very impressive or that had us saying we must return soon  we didnt even stay for desert nor want desert as she had ruined our friday family dinner night with her attitude  when we got the bill my husband stated that the scallop dinner was on the bill still  her response you ordered itwow  you charge your customers for a meal that they were not pleased with and immediately sent back and did not order anything else to replace it with  i had  bites of a  scallop and returned it  very very poor customer service  also to overhear another table order the scallops and she made it a point to tell him how they are seared and that she just wanted to make sure he knew they arent hot looking at me the entire time  rudeover priced diner food  awful decor  old diner plastic style booths|ive been to other movie theaters that serve dinner but this place really doesnt know how to properly execute this we went last night to watch star wars we arrived early to ensure we can order food prior to the movie starting but no we didnt see any waiters until the movie started a good  hour into the movie and people all around us are ordering food we couldnt pay attention to the movie when our waitress finally arrives she informs us that there was a kitchen fire the previous night and most of their food cannot be ordered really why am i just hearing of this a great leadership team would have ensured that all employees communicated this information to customers i went through two employees before reaching our waitress we order hamburgers instead since the oven was lost to a kitchen fire but no they were also sold out of buns  i order a drink to only be told i must choose another one all around me waiters and waitresses are apologizing why would any management team put their employees through that complete morale killer for the staff  just when i though things couldnt get any worse here comes out the food my husband and i ordered the coconut chicken tenders mine had the thai chilli sauce and his had the honey mustard my husband asked the runner which sauce was this she didnt know she then became irate and threw the food down told us she wasnt the cook and continued to walk away the rudeness her running partner saw what happened and immediately apologized he then took the food away and placed it in another section it wasnt our food to begin with but miss attitude walked away before she could determine that food finally arrives our  chicken was over fried almost black and very hard the  nachos were piled high with so many ingredients you could not see the nachos making it very hard to use your hands my  pineapple crush tasted horrible and watered down my daughter was the only one who scored a great tasting cesar salad  if anyone rates this place with more than  stars they clearly have never been to a theater that is top notch in their game clearly they need a new management team|despicable customer service ordered around pmnow after pm and the delivery driver couldnt find the address stated twice over the phone the employees shout on the phone the manager said a man called the first time last time i checked im not a man and was simply rude manager wanted to recount what id done wrong instead of offering a solution if i

has decent food but messes up the orders too often we go there quite a bit getting used to the messed up orders and a lot of the time theyre out of certain sodas when you pay  for a drink i hope they have a supply of it anyways its not too bad of a place but can use some fixing up|horrible service my waitress didnt listen to my order when i asked for things im allergic to not to be in my food she was rude towards me when i asked questions about the food they take forever just to bring my table the two bowls of white rice we were missing and she continues to walk back and forth without acknowledging that we were missing two bowls of rice worst place to eat|the first clue should have been when we waited to order in awkward silence while the cashier held a full on conversation with the sandwich makeronly to turn to us with an irritated look and say im ready for your order when you are  i bit my tongue and proceeded to orderi ordered the medium brisket combo and honestly it tasted great i finished the first half and picked up the second half when my wife pointed out there was a human hair that had been resting under the sandwichleft there presumably by the person who made the sandwichwhen i returned the sandwich to the counter i noted that the hair most likely came from the manager as she had long dark hair and was not wearing a hat visor or hair net as required by law she offered to remake my sandwich and became irritated when i asked her to have someone else make it i then pointed out her health code violation and she replied by telling me shes not required to wear anything on her head nrs  a except as provided in  b of this section food handlers shall wear hair restraints such as hats hair coverings or nets beard restraints and clothing that covers body hair that are designed and worn to effectively keep their hair from contacting exposed food clean equipment utensils and linens and unwrapped singleservice and singleuse articlesb this section does not apply to food employees such as counter staff who only serve beverages and wrapped or packaged foods hostesses and wait staff if they present a minimal risk of contaminating exposed food clean equipment utensils and linens and unwrapped singleservice and singleuse articlesnow i understand maybe she thinks shes exempt under sub section b so i took the trouble of looking up the definition of a food handler as described by the nevada revised statute and found the followingnrs  food handler definednote the  regulations governing the sanitation of food establishments defines food as raw cooked or processed edible substance ice beverage or an ingredient used or intended for use or for sale in whole or in part for human consumption or chewing gumfood handler means any person employed in or operating a food establishment whether that person is an employer employee or other natural person who handles stores transports prepares manufactures serves or sells food or who comes in contact with eating or cooking utensils or other equipment used in the handling preparation manufacture service or sale of foodthe term does not include a person whoonly handles stores transports sells or otherwise comes in contact with food that is sealed and packaged for sale directly to the consumerif the food is potentially hazardous food handles the food only occasionally and incidentally to his responsibilities or employment and such handling is not part of his regularly scheduled responsibilities or employment or is providing services as a cashier salesperson stock clerk warehouse or dockworker delivery person or maintenance staff or providing services in a similar position with limited foodhandling responsibility part   ncl  nrs a        bottom line  you made my sandwich  you are a food handler  and the law applies to youas if contaminating my sandwich by violating health code wasnt bad enough following up by lying about it makes it worse not to mention the other employee who was openly eating in the food prep area while he observed our conversation and the employee who replaced my sandwich not washing his hands in between changing glovesthree health code violations in plain view in a matter of a couple minutes imagine how many more violations there are to be found here i left my car in the parking lot and came back later after shopping looking in the front window i could clearly see another blonde employee making sandwiches without any hair restraintenjoy your hair sandwiches if you eat here that should be their new mottoim contemplating a call to the health inspector maybe they can get these employees sorted out because either they are unaware of proper food handlingserving methods or they just dont care either way my health is more important i will never visit this location again|signed up  charged for bimonthly service and extra bee treatment  weeks later the bees were back  and was basically told only comes with  day warranty never told about

place  i wanted to surprise my daughter with a new phone but wasnt sure exactly what she wanted i inquired about their return policy and was told by the lady who waited on me that i would have  days

cellophane  and unopened she didnt want it i hurried back to the store and demanded my money back they agreed to credit me but they charge a  restocking fee i argued that the box hasnt  even been opened they said it doesnt matter  i was furious at the lady who sold it to me and again stressed that i wasnt sure of the make and model she said it wasnt necessary for her to tell me about that fee because it is written on the back of the receipt  excuse me that is poor customer service and i should have been toldi was however able to catch them on a technicality in that i read their sign regarding returns and that my particular device was excluded if unopened their manager said the sign was old but after agree to credit my account that money i demanded receipts he explained to me that it is not their policy but rather the policy of the manufacturer dont give me that crapopened yes i can see a restocking fee unopened and wrapped give me a break it is perfectly salable to the next

a little rickety but i loved the look and style of it every time i would sit up on the bed it would make a creaking noise it ended up snapping the other night i looked up the warranty online and it stated  years i call customer service and they said it would either be  years  years or  years although that was odd i knew i was still in the safe zone since it had only been a year and a half after placing me on a  minute wait he came back and told me it was only a one year warranty i told him that didnt make sense and although he agreed with me he didnt offer any further help all he said was that he could sell me another bed frame and headboard i will never purchase anything else from living spaces|i purchased a  mattress with adjustable base along with an additional  for  pillows

card  so i called the office and asked them if they had my records  i was told that they did in fact have my file which shows that i still have   available for purchases  so i asked if they could honor their records when i go in to purchase my additional items      i was told that they could not help me even though they have my credit on file  nor would they reissue another card which i did not ask for anyway as it was clearly stated on the back of the card which was misplaced ha  long story short i will not go back to living spaces as their customer service department and acting manager provided less than stellar customer service|i moved in here almost  yrs ago its a great location but forget getting any maint help i have no water in my kitchen for  months now they change employes

airport restaurant the staff would be quick but no our server went on break once we got a food so another server was left to gather our plates refill our drinks and we ended up waiting for our server to come back with our check  mins later i ordered the french dip and added on onions the huge stack of onions was thrown on directly in the middle of the sandwich and not spread throughout so i had a bite of just onions and then none for the rest of my meal as soon as my plate came the bottom slice of bread was completely soaked through so i had to turn my sandwich upside down just to keep it together the au jus tasted and looked like warm brown water i didnt add any flavor at all to the sandwich my husband said his burger tasted like a frozen patty do yourselves a favor and unless youre looking to hang out for a while and drink beer try one of the other options in this terminal| christmas date with my boyfriend with a la carte ordersspicy tuna rolls my boyfriend ordered these since im not a big fan of sushi based on what he says good but not enough when i asked him what about it wasnt enough he simply said that there was too little rice and not enough filling one order came with  piecescalamari tempura  nice and warm i really like the sauce with the tempura minus one cause according to my bf it lacks saltbulgogi  i really enjoyed this one my boyfriend said it was personally  stars for him because it was a bit soggy but i think this tapas did have a lot of flavor a bit of a kick although it looked a little dry at firstshrimp skewers  for us both he thought it was too greasy but too dry i personally love shrimp but there wasnt anything special about this onepork katsu breading was falling off for one at some point one whole side came off of my katsu  and it was really dry but to be fair the sauce was super good despite that and made it a lot better miso soup   not salty enough for the boyfriend but he does love miso soup so  it is and it took the looooongest time to come out service   okay to be brutally honest the service sucked the waitresses spoke too quietly if at all and the other waiter who initially took our orders completely ignored us altogether hardly anyone checked on us except maybe once or twice while they were grabbing our dirty dishes and our miso soup  never came until he asked waitress  minutes after we finished the rest of our food  also while ordering the waiter was not polite at all we literally had to ask ourselves to get our check after  minutes finishing everything like whats with thattldr food was decent for the price we paid but as food servers ourselves service needs to definitely be reevaluated my boyfriend outright refused to tip just for how bad the service was and he doesnt want to go back|i will start by saying dont be tempted by their cheaper interest rates if something appears too good to be trueit probably is at least in this case the loan process started positive but once transferred to the final loan processor things went downhill first the processor was scheduled to call me for a phone meeting and she called nearly  minutes beyond the scheduled time okno biggy the final closer later sent an email stating that she would review the file and get back to me regarding if there were any outstanding loan items needed on my end she never sent anything by email or called  days later i reached out to another person that was listed on the loan no response until  days later indicating that she couldnt help me so now i call the generic contact number and really no answers yet i am scheduled to close in  days and have no clue where i stand on timeline and i have sent in required docs i am hopeful that management will contact me but as of now no response bottom line is they dont return calls or emails and you are left standing on your head wondering whether you will close on time and if you dont close on time then sign away more money for a rate lock extension i have excellent credit and have never experienced this before with other lenders beware of this lender|visited this location earlier tonight with a group of friends and was not impressed at all by the by the book staff  as part of our order we ordered a dozen oysters  the waiter came and said we only have  left for the night  we said ok no problem bring the four  the waiter said let me check with the manager and see if i can sell them to you  we said ok  mean while we were talking amoungest our selfs discussing how weird it was that he wouldnt just have offered us the oysters for free beings they only had four left  he came back said stated he could not sell us the oysters as it would screw up there inventory  wtf  are they planing on saving them till they get their next shipment to be able to complete a order of  or   its situations like this where customer service is completely ignored because someone be it the waiter or manager didnt have the balls to make a judgment desicion  i only give this place two stars because the craw daddys we did order were very good|i enjoy pita jungle menu but the decour at  this site is too industrial making it noisy and uncomfortable to make matters worse they play terrible music and the sound system is horrible the staff yell and through plates around without regard for dinners too bad|just ate here first time foods are okay it just took so long to get our two orders waited abt min long long waiting while not many customers and its monday late morning|we grabbed a pizza to go askedfor some napkins and paper plates and were told theyre for dine in customers only  seriously had i known that before i purchased i would not have  just so you know we will never be back|we almost did not enter as the place was empty about pm but i had read about the  salsas and we pushed forward just as one other car pulled into the dimly lit parking lot the mexican restaurant next door was packed so we probably should have went over there this regional brand of mexican food might appeal to nongringos as most of the food was quite unusual and hot and some food was just downright bad the  order of guac had large chunks of avocado but also has raisins and a liquidy kind of taste it was not what you would expect in a normal mexican joint the steak tacos i ordered had to be sent back due to excessive fatty pieces and the chicken tinga tacos were way too spicy for a normal palette the spicy theme continued as nearly all  salsas had a version of heat that ran too hot this was a sweaty experience so gringos stay away on a positive note the pregnant waitress was very nice and helpful|came on a monday hookah was harsh  had to keep asking someone to come fit it  they seemed bothered everytime we asked they werent very welcoming  wont come here again |i was happy to find a full service seafood restaurant so close to my gate since i didnt have a lot of extra time before my connection i ordered the lobster bisque which came out pretty quickly however it was only lukewarm and a skin was already forming on the top it also was very sweet and a bit clumpy i also had the waffle fries which were highlighted on the menu and they were also only lukewarm which is pretty unacceptable especially for fries overall pretty mediocre and i wouldnt go back|the store looked very nice upon entering but they didnt have a big selection they have maybe a case worth of mods but they stretched it out into multiple cases the selection was very limited and the juice wasnt a good selection either wont come back and wont recommend|its not for everyone its more like a fast food restaurant the food is different its not your regular asian page ll|very expensivevery stingy with the meat but super bright  clean restaurantnicest most polite  beautiful black employees| stars for cool seats  the management is invisible when there is an issue showing started and lights were still on completely through previews into first  minutes of film    per ticket you should have that dimmed and ready  when i complained after they hunted down a manager which took  min manager was snotty and said call this number to get a voucher this number just rings and rings no matter what time you call  no email either lights to serve food  no this was all entry lights and lights over the screen  ruined the d experience|i took my family to see the new star wars here today the seats are great theyre super comfortable and recline all the way back we ordered a few things to share and the food that came was quite enjoyable but be ready to pay fine dining prices for decent pub fare the reason for  stars is simply the fact that the service was bad really inexcusable for these kinds of prices the popcorn we ordered never came so after we were done with the entrees and  minutes into the movie we hit the service button and somebody other than our first server came out to us we explained that we didnt get our popcorn and that person apologized and said that theyd go get it for us right away another  minutes went by no popcorn in fact it seemed like there was no staff at all even though the theater was packed none of our dirty old dishes were removed they were just left to sit in front of us the entire movie is this the normal policy or was it just a lazy day for the staff we werent going to push the call button again and ask  times for the same item when the bill came sure enough the popcorn was listed there and charged for  we complained to our server and she apologized and took it off the bill but i think they shouldve done more for a double screw up like this sorry kids maybe next time well get popcorn i think when you pay over  for a family of  to go to a lunch and movie service should be better|i cant get in contact with anyone  i purchased a membership and prepaid for my birthday dress the app wont allow me to choose a dress and no one answers the phone will dispute with credit card|i have never experienced such a horrible service at a restaurant before my friends and i sat down looking at the menu for  minutes discussing what to get and the waiter comes to our table asking us if we have any questions and then we told him we were fine we just need more time to look at the menu later after another  minutes he comes again asking us if we were ready and i told him no were still looking at the menu then suddenly he gives us a frown and said could i stand here and wait till you guys are decisive or not i was so in shock i asked him to repeat what he said and loudly he told me he was going to stand at our table to see if we decide to order or not rude my friends and i could not believe him so i told him we still need more time because it was our first time at the restaurant and as soon as he left the table after giving us the rolled eye we left the restaurant this waiter had square black framed glasses asian with a shaved head i have never been treated this way at a restaurant before wish i could have spoken with the manager|yesterday was the worst experience in this restaurant we arrive at  pm my husband my two toddlers girls and i the restaurant it wasnt busy when the server took our drink order we order a wings of fire and the fancy dancy pizza the wings arrived at  and the pizza  minutes later the server said that this pizza took so longer to cook but the pizza was a mess it was burned the bread was like a salty cracker and the cheese looked like microwave heated my husband told me that we should leave the place but my girls were so hungry the manager went to our table and said sorry for the crispy pizza and she paid for the pizza i heard another families making complains we used to go to the shea location and always was perfect|had a massage with ericka although the massage she provided was skilled and effective i was unimpressed with her ability to connect with me as a client i feel it is important to provide a great massage as well as make your client feel comfortable which she was unable to do at the end she asked me to pay for a  min massage even though i had a  min massage i had to correct her and her response was that i needed a  min massage  im giving my experience two stars because the massage itself was good and i was able to schedule on short notice|ok i have been here twice thinking that the first time it must of been me but after coming here a second time im convinced carlos bakery is to commercialized lets first start with the attendants and the insufficient manner at which they attend to customers all of the attendants are behind the counter doing absolutely nothing while the just one that is taking orders takes an order and then goes back to box the items all while the line gets outrageous perhaps thats what their trying to achieve but really  people behind the counter and only one taking orders and just one ringing up the orders get it together carlos i wont get started on the desserts they are too bland and obviously have lost their original touch now that the bakery is commercialized get it together carlos|for such a highly rated place what i experienced hopefully was an offnight and not some strange hype related rating disease  the burger i had was completely average just teetering the line between bad and ok  not much flavor to be had semismall pricey burger which is a pretty awful combination  there are a lot of great burgers in the valley and this was very much not one of them|what an overrated rip off glazers grocery store has twice as good donuts for  cents less and they are expensive  went down late sunday afternoon just to try the lox and cream cheese donut i read about in the paper and was informed they quit making those at   could have told someone on the phone duh  anyway i got the chocolate covered with coconut  it was just a thick plain cake donut with a thin layer of mediocre chocolate  this place isnt worth the effort or money not including the bad service with one guy at the time|sadly the food just wasnt very good presentation service and atmosphere were fine  for short rib entree it was pot roast and not very well seasoned pot roast either beet salad looked good but no taste duck prosciutto was bland for this price point we were extremely disappointed like giada etc but this was below average|it was my fianc s bday and i decided to suprise him i had high expectationasand cant wait to taste te food so we came to the restaurant it was very nice very nice decorated but when they brought the food it was just a simple italian food nothing special  the same thing that i used to make at home im very disappointed because if its celebrity chef and that expensive  it should be something unbelievably delicious  ive been in italy and honestly buying food in the streets of italy was more delicious and authentic then coming to giadas restaurant  it was a big joke never gnna come back nothing special just a simple italian food that you can eat everywhere|for the price the food is  stars good but not excellent my girlfriend and i ordered lavishly total of approx  i ordered a  ribeye rare it was cooked all the way to medium never sent a steak back before but this was too much the waitress took it to the cook then came back and asked if i wanted a percent off or a new steak i said if it was enough off i would take my steak back but how much off did she mean she had to go check came back and told me i could get  off  really i told her i wanted a new steak i was annoyed and told her offering  off on a hundred dollar meal was a little sad she said well you said you wanted the steak back are you kidding me whats the alternative you give me  off but i dont get my steak she must have said something because the manager came up with the cook the cook told me it was accidentally cooked to medium rare but not medium  really so the cook comes up to argue that he only messed up by one level instead of two he was wrong but who cares this whole situation was ridiculous my new steak was obviously rushed and just thrown on the waitress did end up comping my bill  or so but the experience was horrid a huge part of spending  on one dinner is the experience i was considering taking a large group of friends here when they visit if it ended up being a great place but believe me i will not be back manager never said much at all to me basically ignored the situation believe me when i tell you avoid this place if you expect good service i will give them credit on a good salad bar nice decor steak was just ok italian fare was surprisingly really really good|eff this place ill never return they just caused nearly k worth of damage to my car dont go just dont youve been warned|just like many other reviewers i was unfortunate enough to experience the horrible customer service of this companys dispatch center when i called to ask for an approximate arrival time of the cab the male dispatcher proceeded to cut me off and sarcastically tell me he has no idea because he has no idea who i am or where i am going well sir if you would stop to let me finish my sentence or politely ask for my information i would happily give it to you instead i asked him to stop speaking to me in such a rude manor in response to this he began to have an adult hissy fit while screaming yelling and threatening to hang up on me i asked for his name and he proceeded to hang up on me  i called back got another dispatcher and asked to speak to a manager he informed me that there were no managers at the dispatch center and said i could leave my information and i would receive a call back i left my information but never received a phone call i have actually never left a negative review for a company as i typically just discontinue my use of their services but this experience was so unbelievably ridiculous and unnecessary that i felt compelled to share with other customers i will certainly be sharing my experience with my friends and coworkers|after the paperwork was signed for a six month lease and deposits made they said there was a mistake and asked for more money which was paid  the rent was to include everything including gym but not cable or internet  approximately  month later gym required  and was not included and neither was water  garbage    they require  months notice which was given in november and now they are saying that a  month lease was signed which is a total lie  it is either a clerical error on their part which was not noticed or done on purpose to get more money  a two month notice was given on their paperwork and signed off on and they are requiring another one because they moved the date to  months  they say they are not required to rent the apartment if the keys are turned over which i think is incorrect  totally rude and condescending and thievesi dont intend to go back and forth on this but your implication that it was a credit issue that changed the amount due is another lie  it was incorrect math on your staffs part just like the incorrect math on adding months for a six month lease   your company is incredibly unscrupulous  your lying replies are just thatlies|not impressed at all this place came recommended to me  we had the sliders which had far too much bread and not enough flavor and the fish tacos which were fishy and clearly not fresh we didnt like the seating arrangement either so sorry vig never again|worst everi went to this restaurant last night around their closing time waiter come to me with menu and asked rudely to order fast as they are closing i order quickly for one pad thai noodles they gave me a another order saying its pad thai i always eat pad thai and that was not a pad thai for sure but i managed to eat that while eating he gave me my cheque expecting me to leave fast my bill was  cad and they dont except cards so i paid by cash i paid  cad the waiter didnt came up with my change assuming that it goes into tip so my change was technically  which was the potential tip i asked another waiter to bring my change he got pissed off he kept the change on my table and said where is my tip i said not for this service not today his literal words were why you indians have to be so cheap you guys are so cheap he abused and showed offensive gesturesdeep inside i knew he was being a beggar and asking for tip  the worst part was when the fight started the other waiter also joined him and they start yelling for indian community which was way too offensiveif it can happen to me it could happen to you there is no manager that you can complaint too if you would like to get insulted over worst food then this is your pick|i would have given them  stars until i experienced an unload of  messages via email notification from the app untappd after rating their beers i rated them anywhere from  stars for a few of their beers this is just two of the examples of the comments posted on the app all but one have been deletedyou either dont know how this app works and how it affects small independent business owners oryoure a cunt not sure on which of those the beer research institutetwo camps you fit into butjesus fucking christ thanks for trying our beeri guessthe beer research institutei actually recommended this business yesterday before i received these messages today i hope that the owner knows what they are advertising its extremely unfortunate that those who were great to us while we were there have to be associated with working for a company who would allow something like this to be sent out to one of their patrons sincerelyits not my beer ratings that will kill your business these are screenshots of the email notifications|i couldnt get past the ordering process before walking out because of horrible customer service no thanks i rather spend my money at chipotle next door|too long of a wait and they are always running out of fruit how do you run out of fruit when all you do is make fruit smoothies its hit and miss with smoothie consistency|absolutely loved this place until i found  hairs in my sandwich|was super excited to try this place out only to be really let down got a chicken panini sandwich there and i was very underwhelmed to say the least was way below average chicken was dried out  ingredients did not taste very fresh and for the price  you could literally go a few blocks and get  panini sandwiches for what they charge for one also skip getting the fries at this place because they were hardly even cooked  very raw  and the ones that were cooked tasted worse than homemade mccain fries i can see how this place will appeal to students since its literally across the street from mcgill but i really cant see it lasting that much longer unless they make drastic changes|worst franchise ever and especially in san tan valley these aholes wont deliver  miles away from their location is it cuz they cant figure out neighborhoods or are their drivers are not smart enough to use a map gps googlethis company will never get mine or my familys business worst business ever especially since their food is subpar to begin with|the  spicy fish n spicy beef is too bad may today is monday the meet is too old that not tasty like be before i will not come  back againby the way the water is very nice but i think the food very important for a restrautant to run their business good luck |just stopped in other people at the barsat at the bar waiting to orderwaitingwaitinganother couple sat downthey were greeted and got their drinkswe were still waitingand waitingand leftonly one star because you have to leave will not be back|i imagine they would probably be a good place if one they made an ipa and two they didnt close early to cater to an invested christmas party i understand theyll make more money with the christmas party but perhaps they could also have staff to cater to regular people who would like to enjoy beer oh wait no that makes too much sense this scenario seems par for the course for charlotte|i was sad to give such a low rating for my experience the starters were quite promising excellent garlic edamame and steamed shumai however the service is simply terrible my wifes plate was brought to her some  min before i ever received my food she had finished well before i even received my own order it did not escape me that another party who arrived and placed their orders at least  min after we did ordered the same thing as myself the chef preparing food at the bar in front of me simply waited and did the dishes at the same time i sat through the whole lunch watching my wife finish her meal before mine came out at the exact moment the other partys meals were delivered no apology at all nothing said before we paid our bill and left moreover my sushi and sashimi combo was entirely average at best a fair price but disappointing nonetheless only days ago i had been enjoying delicious sashimi from some of my favorite places in california avoid this place there are other options with better service|clean but bathroom is poorly designed the shower curtain only covers half the shower and water ends up all over the floor oh and sleep there but dont gamble no jackpot winner in  days that i saw get some exercise walk the strip restaurants also suck oh yes we had a suite too no coffee pot wtf|i rented a house from them in feb  two days after moving in my car was towedi was not informed you could not park on the side of the street after pm yes you can only park in your drivewayproperty was in a hoa and had one big mailbox since i didnt receive a key icalled to ask them for a key and was told i had to get it from the post office in which i had to pay  for onethen in dec of  i received a lease renewal and after only  year of occupying the house they raised the rent by  i worked  days a week  hours a day and didnt have the time and want to hassle with movingin august of  i had a massive heart attack and was barely able to walk as it left me completely disabledi have  small children and struggled to make the rent up to december as we know how long it takes to receive disability benefitsaround december th i received the new lease in the mail and it was once again raised by  a month at this point  might as well have been  and i almost collapsedso per my lease i had written up a notice to vacate and hand delivered it to chad in the phx officei was pretty surprised after telling him of my familys hardship that he just smiled and signed it with a blank faceso this christmas instead of celebrating we are packing and wondering where we will live on very little money come march|i am experiencing the same issue as patrick s began our lease in january  and just received our lease renewal rent is increasing but nearly mo i can only imagine it will only increase over time we are looking to move by the end of our notice to vacate the home is not worth what they are asking for in rent and i refuse to pay the extra because they feel its some how justified we have never been late on rent never asked for much of anything from them we just pay our rent and live in the property feels dirty to increase rent for no apparent reason if i could do it over again i would not have rented with them if you do choose to ask for the hoa rules and regulations as we have also received a notice in regards to on street overnight parking when we had family in town this is not posted in our community and apparently we were just supposed to have known thisupdate  contacted management and waiting on response if it is at all possible to maintain our rent at the same price we initially had will update if i ever receive a call back and what their feedback is|weve only been tmobile customers for a year and while we are happy with our service from the company as a whole the employees at this store are either totally wrong about deals and promotions or they flat out lie to close the deal avoid this store use the website chat option instead so at least you can get a transcript of what youre being told instead of having a yourwordvstheir situation never coming back here|we had a little over an hour to kill before watching a movie so we decided to check this place out since it was right next to the theaters there was an advertisement that said they have  wide screen tvs sunday night football was on so why notwe sat down at one of the tables and waited for a while the service was slow and they were not very busy one of the servers finally took our drink orders and brought us menus the husband and i decided to share the chili cheese fries with bacon which is a part of their featured football items the portion was bigger than we thought it looked pretty good at first unfortunately the fries were kind of dry the chili and cheese tasted very bland and the added bacon did not make it better in any way im glad we didnt spend an extra  to add chicken or porkcool place to watch your football games but its too bad that the food was horrible i also think they should put a sign at the entrance saying please seat yourself since i saw a group of customers standing around and waiting for service i miss tgi fridays|nothong like it used to be   its now a big corporation which has changed the name and all stores alltogether   sad but it happens i used to buy and resell to them since  but its not the same |ive been coming here since they opened they used to be quick and great foodprices  theyve changed their menu raised prices new staff that seems confused extremely slow service and dirty  the food is ok  disappointing that this is the only pho i can find near me|the food there has no flavor service was terrible i have never giving anything  star before but this place deserve it|you dont even deserve one star the worst urgent care ive ever been to first of all one other patient in the waiting room but i waited for over an hour was told by the creepy lady working the front desk that i was covered under my insurance come to find out i wasnt after they already had taken my copayment for the dr visit then they wanted to keep my card on file for their reference definitely not the way to run a doctors office dr johnston was very awkward and didnt seem to care what i was there for but the  bill wasnt worth someone taking my blood pressure and asking me a few questions pathetic whos the owner of this dump|i come here often with various friends and family and it is by far one of the best karaoke joints in town i also often recommend this business to many others as well however my last visit was very disappointing i had visited their website and there was a coupon under the promotions tab that stated that if you have a  tab or higher they will deduct  off the total bill they did not honor this during my last visit even though this coupon did not have an expiration date listed on their website|i had a great time today at top golf with my family however my experience was only hindered by the staff and business organization of this franchise we were first greeted by a rude and inconsiderate employee who escorted us to our bay she seemed apathetic towards our experience explaining that there was no way to play any other games she explained to us that as out of state players we were able not able to have our own team because of this the  of us were forced to play on two teams instead of being all able to compete against each other as desired just as we had teed off we were introduced to our bayhost a very impatient waitress she continually exclaimed hello as we were trying to watch our grandma hit the ball and took no message from the fact that we did not immediately turn around she explained to noone the drinks and left before taking any orders she returned two minutes later to see if we need anything and didnt return for the rest our hour an a half stay at top golf i would love to return again for this fun family experience when i come back to arizona but not until these kinks are knocked out|family went here got food poisoning its the only shared meal they had and i didnt eat it myself so im just fine its sixteen hours after they consumed the disappointing burgers and they are still recovering|seems like a pretty nice deal for whats basically a regular corporate gym  a bit crowded  the oddness started when i asked to get a copy of the contract emailed to me so i could look it over without someone breathing down my neck eager for me to sign it  no they said id have to come in to view it  red flag  i mentioned that didnt make sense because if i signed id get a copy anyways  so they said theyd give me one to pick up and when i did they had written void all over it  fine whatever theyre being paranoid  well it got really interesting when i read the contract about twothirds of it was a massive waiver of liability basically saying if they spill water on the floor and someone trips tough luck  if they dont maintain any of the equipment and someones foot gets crushed too bad  then after that theres a oneliner about how eos doesnt have to offer cardio or weight lifting equipment and those are incidental to the establishment  what  if those go away whats left a movie theater a tanning salon in the vegas area  seriously a store and a kid care service and some trainers who wouldnt be able to train anyone  then the contract says go to suchandsuch an address on the eos site to request a waiverless version of the contract but keep in mind the monthly fees will be significantly higher  the site says someone will be in contact within three business days  nope  after a week i let codyn know he contacted his manager and it turns out they were just kidding  all members must give up their right to hold eos responsible for any liability  no exceptionsi go to the gym to lift not play games  if a gym feels the need to play games like this and cover their posterior like this i shudder to think how members are actually treated and i certainly wouldnt want to put my wellbeing at risk by going there|smallest imax i have ever been to seats were torn and somewhat reclined somewhat fell back theater was clean and staff was friendly and there was plenty of people to make sure we had a good time popcorn was stale and nachos were not that great i wont be going back unless they do some serious remodeling and get better food|we heard about thai street through yelp and thought it was super good after a long day in vegas me and my girlfriend just wanted so have delicious thai delicacies  however it was not to be the waitstaff were incredibly unhelpful and didnt even give us menus the whole time the server was on the phone and i had to ask the server to take our order after she ignored us for  minutes when the food eventually came after forever it was terrible the attitude and                  inattentiveness of the waitstaff totally ruined our night  stars never gonna return|if i could give this place no stars i would  my boyfriend and i were visiting vegas for the weekend and i had the biggest craving for thai food we looked to yelp for a good place and it led me to this restaurant  it had great reviews and i was really excited  we got to the restaurant at  upon entering we were not greeted not acknowledged after  minutes we finally got acknowledged and seated maybe  minutes in to waiting  the waitress finally came over  there was  waitress probably  person cooking the food in the restaurant  and  really clueless looking waiter  rolled around still no drinks  no water  nothing  at  o clock  still no drinks  no food so we just left honestly the wait for the food would have been no big deal if i could have at least been served a water thanks for ruining my last dinner in vegas|cab

shakes so maybe for desert or a treat|the menu was too damn small and the waitress called my moms quesadilla a quesadilia and i thought i was eating rat feces|tried the grilled chicken sandwich right off the bat it was ready in  minutes a horrible sign and eating it was incredibly dry almost like jerky inedible threw it away was in a hurry and left without complainingsomething tells me i was served food that was returned or premade and just sitting there disgusting and a shame for a restaurant advertising freshnesschik fil a i have never this with|this place is pricey and while the food

and not flavorful at all will come back to try the bistec tacos because i see those are a yelpers favorite|welp i dont think i have ever been so pumped to try a new restaurant before than i was when i saw tako opened and was getting rave review ive been waiting patiently to get the right time to get everyone together finally got around to it last weekend i gotta say i was so underwhelmed we walked in and were promptly seated per our reservations but it took about  minutes for our waiter to come say hi long enough that we paroozed the menu and already picked out what we wanted we ordered drinks one was a mixed drink which was too strong of a drinksecondly the tacos were good but not that expensive good i know a lot of people really enjoyed it but i just dont think its my taste|their tech named joey stole around twenty thousand dollars worth of jewelry from my closet  which was the access to my attic  this was a couple months ago i called them  they were disinterested i made police report  my household insurance only covered five thousand for jewelry the company called to solicit more business from me thats how i learned the techs name which they said didnt work there anymore i would never use them  they have even a free service to check air conditioners turns out not to be so freedisgusted with them |weak message weak weak weak my girlfriend and i paid the  for the hour message and we both feel we didnt get our moneys worth and in additionthey insisted we give them a  tip each insisted meaning they wouldnt take less so the  message turned out to be a  and definitely not worth it|your cook is good but very salty if you can do that im  percent you gain more customer your kare kare crispy pata is very good but only one problem salty|do not i repeat do not for the love of god go here for poke this was the worst poke i have ever tasted even i make it better  there were no sesame oil or sesame seeds and  while shit all that damn salt thats in there its insane it tastes nothing like how poke should taste if you want good poke go to island sushi they have various types of poke to choose from my bf ordered the shoyu poke plate and i ordered the bbq chicken with a lb side of limu poke all that came out to  the only thing that was good was my bbq chicken we had to throw the rest away the poke made the bf sick that when we got home he passed out for a few hours we will never come here again|was really excited to try the new location in south charlotte loved the decor and the menu looked promising could not stay to dine in so i bought a small vanilla cake with a strawberry on top to take home and while it looked absolutely mouthwatering i have to say that i was really disappointed in it i cut it in half to share with my grandson and the cake fell apart not in a good way the cake completely separated from the frosting that was on top and in the middle and neither had any taste to it it was like eating cardboard we did not even finish the half after  bites each we threw it out plus the other half in the box while i was not expecting it to taste like a pastry shop in paris i did expect alot more from a  cake|went today for a late lunch i ordered the cheeseburger poutine and my bf ordered pork  ways poutine the staff was friendly and the food came out fast it looked really yummy but i just didnt like mine either the meat or the cheese had a weird smell to it guessing the beef since my bfs food smelled fine i dont think it was spoiled or anything just cookedseasoned different than i cook mine my food was really salty too i ate about  bites and called it quits gave the rest to a sweet homeless man outside who started devouring it immediately my bf finished his food and said it was pretty good but his stomach hurt him for a good while afterwards cause its definitely not easy to digest with all the salt and fat my review is solely based on the cheeseburger poutine i liked the fries and pickles im open to try a different menu item another time poutine isnt for me but im glad i tried it|way over priced  for an outerwear vest rent is high someone has to pay the bills on this dingy joint slovenly dressed sales women|chiam  on craig and jonesdrove by mutiple times couldnt wait to try wow just like panda express nothing to be excited about just allot more money and food was cold tried and denied wont be back|im currently sitting in the restaurant because i couldnt wait until later to write a review my service was absolutely horrible while my food was great and seasoned it was cold when i attempted to let the manager know he was extremely rude he came to the table and says whats up takes the food and brings back hot food later no apology no introduction nothing food is great service is the worst ive encountered in a very long time|i find it ridiculous that your spending so much money on over priced mediocre drinks and then on top of that spend  on a glass of water thats no re fills shut with  i can buy  gallons of water so when i asked the owner why one is it so much for a little glass of water and no refills he has the nerve to say i have a business to run are you kidding at least if ur gonna charge  it better have refills shit is ridiculous i mean come on i understand if im not buying any drinks and i ask for a cup of water but if i paying for ur over priced drinks already at least give me a free cup of water lol ugh so over it the music was ok need to find a better latin club|i really wanted to like bakn i really did the atmosphere decor and location are great for this place and the concept is great too everyone loves bacon right but the food is very disappointing the first time my husband and i went he got a grilled chicken sandwich and i got the breakfast sandwich  recommended by the waitress we also shared the bacon jam and biscuits my husbands chicken sandwich the chicken was burnt to a crisp so all you could taste was char my breakfast sandwich was ok better than the chicken sandwich but it was so incredibly greasy the bacon jam was pretty tasty but it just didnt go well with the biscuits considering the biscuits were crumbly and dry they were more like scones than biscuits we gave bakn a second chance and ordered the bacon stuffed pancakes and an eggs breakfast the pancakes what a nightmare they were so crumbly and dry and the eggs breakfast theres not much you can screw up but bakn managed to cook the home fries to the point they were chewy and inedible all in all the menu looks and sounds amazing but certainly does not taste so great|i am from afghanistan we make better and delicious food in homei ordered qabuli and kofta  they brought something cooked last weekthe next day i got sicki paid  and trashed the fooddont go here never|i usually go on my lunch break but today i decided it was the last time the staff is to slow i had to walk out because i wanted to order to go but the host took all day coming back to see what i wanted that i used half of my time last time i went i found a clear rod in my fries i got a cheese steak next door at the nosh it did the job i wont be back|i created a yelp account just to give this place a review they have horrible service they dont even deserve the one star that i am forced to give them i emailed them two months ago informing them about the lack of customer service and they never got back to me bad business all around long wait times one time they never even acknowledged me in the drive thru after about  minutes and i ended up driving off and constantly out of products havent been in months i dont plan on ever going back to a tropical smoothie hi jamba juice|not a fan   had to go back for an adjustment for a simple mens haircut   while cutting my hair all i heard was how great he was at cutting hair   not going back|after multiple visits over the past few months this last weekend was our last visit for awhile  we stopped in on a wednesday evening and found an open hightop table and waited nearly  minutes before even being offered water  the acoustics in here are awful and we couldnt barely hear each other talking  my husband was served the wrong beer which can happen but the replacement was served with over  foamhead  knowing it would take awhile to get a new one we just drank our beers and left  we even joined the loyalty club when they first opened but unfortunately are not inclined to visit much due to the slow inattentive service slightly high prices and extremely awful acousticsfood is decent the pretzel is a must|have been sitting here for  minutes and no service at all talked to the manager and he said we could leave if we wanted to total bs service here |made an appointment online to go in to this urgent care since my primary care physician had a waiting list for same day appointments ended up having the worst experience with the doctor i came in because when i swallow it feels like i am swallowing knives same symptoms i had back in april when i had strep throat the doctor came in the room talking a mile a minute would barely let me speak and when he asked me a question would cut me off before i was even able to answer he was rude and did not even attempt to listen to me regarding my symptoms i was in so much pain that i could barely get my voice to project to answer him so when he asked if i felt like i was losing my voice i was confused since he could hear with his own two ears that my voice was not there the minute i answered yes he said well you dont have strep if you feel like you are losing your voice he then proceeds to tell me my strep test came back negative which it also did in april when i actually had strep and didnt mention sending my test out for culture which is what they are supposed to do with a strep test in april my culture came back positive after the initial inoffice test said negative so after i walked out i called back to ask how long it would take for the culture results and the receptionist tells me the doctor didnt send my test out for culture but if i wanted to come back and have him swab my throat again i could what a pointless appointment i now have to go see my primary care doctor anyways to get an educated and knowledgeable diagnosis thanks for nothing medpost urgent care what a waste of time and money|the shop itself is really nice decorwise theres plenty of seating at the bar which has a great light fixture above it theres also a long table one solid slice of tree to the side when we went they were setting up for a painting event so i imagine that there is usually more standard seating throughout the rest of the shop mint hill is desperate for a place like this which is why i had hoped it would be so much better than it was it certainly wasnt there are a lot of staffing and management issues to work out before vintners hill is worth a second tripwhen we first came in we were halfheartedly greeted by employees who were focused on setting up for a painting class nobody welcomed us explained the setup to us or asked if we had questions we seated ourselves at the bar and were handed menus that was about the extent of the customer serviceright away my wife got a bad vibe and started hinting about just having one drink there we had planned on vintners hill being our only stop of the evening and doing the whole shebang there it ended up being a oneanddone for ussix craft beers are on tap and theres a heavy charlotte focus five taps one tap was from westbrook which made everything on tap a carolina craft beer for small  ounce pours  especially of the standard stuff  the prices are a little much the bartender that served us knew nothing about craft beers  or what they served on tap in general  and spent a few minutes looking though all of the wines for the sugar creek one seriously the glassware selection is terrible as well especially for a place that emphasizes craft beer with huge window stickers the wine tap system is strange it might have been soap residue on the glass or just a bad pour but my wifes wine had a frothy head to it that made it really unpalatable the entire time we were there we were served by a new employee and she was terrible i chalk that up to management who leaves a new employee who doesnt even know that sugar creek is a brewery how to close a tab or how to perform other basic tasks to function completely independently behind the bar the other regular employees were busy setting up for the painting class really priorities people finally when we received our check it was messed up on halfoff glass night we were charged  for a glass of wine that was originally  i understand the idea of different size pours but this was never stated on the menu or by the bartender overall it was not a pleasant experience and certainly not one that justifies a return visit in the near future i hope this place is a success and i will come back once they show some competent management but ive talked to a lot of people with similar experiences and the situation looks fairly grim|my wife and i have eaten here twice and we have been disappointed both times we live here in surprise and would love to make this our local hang but the quality of their food has left us wondering whats going on in the kitchen  we love texas roadhouse but we will continue to drive to the i and peoria location|just a shitty bootleg version of rolling smokewith a  surcharge for being next to a dismal pawn shop and having ricks fleshy mug posted on the walls  what a mistake to think it might be more|dimarco and gang have created a lovely atmosphere at buck  rider on camelback but the food  primarily seafood was average at best and the service was tremendously sub par we were there on a sunday night and it was surprisingly crowded although there was no wait  no reservations taken sitting at a table for  we found ourselves straining our voices  just to hear each other very noisy beyond ability to have normal conversation  but my biggest complaint is value for the price  for one crab claw  for a glass of anderson valley chardonnay  come on  bill for dinner for  with one glass of wine each was almost   much better places for better value elsewhere |i dont normally write reviews but i just dined here for lunch with my mom and two children  and  and i dont understand why its so busy dont waste your money go somewhere else especially if you have younger children with youwe waited about  minutes once we were seated to get our drink order then we waited another  minutes for those drinks to come and for our order to be taken once our food arrived the waitress never came back to fill our drinks or ask how everything wasnothing special about the food itself my mom and i both had bean burrito enchilada styles which i thought for  was kind of expensive because it was a large flour tortilla with a small amount of beans and bland sauce i had to put a bunch of salsa on it to give it some flavor because all i taste was the tortilla also it was recommended by the waitress to wait to give my children milk until the food arrived so i thought okay sure however by that time they had drank water and didnt really drink the milk which happened to be  for a childrens milk with all of that being said well never go back there are much better places around bad service bland food and expensive for what you get|horrible management after a long wait for our server to even come say hello to us and waiting forever for only two salads the kale and quinoa salad came with no quinoa in it we mentioned it to our server who was very sweet and apologized we then flagged down the manager he noted half the meal was missing due to kitchen error but he did not take off anything from our bill or discount the half provided salad horrible customer service|we rolled up to the cheesecake factory at around noon they were running at about  minutes wait for a table but my family and i were lucky enough to snag bar seating i sat down and ordered a bloody mary and a plate of nachos for an appetizer when my bloody mary arrived it looked and tasted like watered down tomato juice with a solitary celery stalk waving hello barely any spices were added and i almost wondered if they forgot a little something something strike  the nachos were decent nothing special but passable bar food nonetheless for my meal i ordered the shepherds pie though with ground beef instead of lamb it was more of a cottage pie lunch came out almost on top of the appetizers strike  oh well no biggie really initially the meal looked promising with red potato skins in the mashed potatoes julienned carrots and parsley unfortunately i was in for a nasty surprise it turns out when the cheesecake factory says ground beef they really mean huge chunks of crumbled up hamburger patty i also have  a sneaking suspicion that they save the hamburger patties they really screwed up for the dubious honor of being covered with gravy and hidden in mashed potatoes the patty used in my meal was blackened and crispy on the bottom they tell you that activated charcoal is great for detoxification well based on the hunk of carbon i just snacked on i should be rid of any toxins ive come into contact with for the last ten years not delicious hey batter batter he swings he misses steeerike  and im outta here|great place and location with an awful  staff and horrendous service i expect db to be an electrifying fun place with a high energy friendly staff especially at its location in the westgate entertainment district i know this is a new location and maybe it was the pressure of a grand opening deadline that forced them to take anyone with a pulse to fill positions we all hope the unqualified noncustomer service staff members are weeded out and replaced by quality hardworking friendly and honest individuals jt was our waiter and he was terrible when youre in a profession that customarily rewards service with tips that reflect the level of quality its amazing that customer service is a problem many people are willing to pay for good service a large part of the blame belongs to management lack of training engagement and awareness of whats happening in their establishment is reflected on the staffs lowlevel performance with the westgate area buildup service and hospitality will be the difference in the competition with the east valley|horrible food we have been there three times and the food is not cooked or cold this last time the beans were burned wont be returning ill drive the extra five minutes and go to taco bell|wedged between spoon and the new twisted frenchman muddy waters is themed as a new orleans style bistro the menu reflects this although im not sure that adding greens and grits actually makes you southernunderstand that we were there something like    days after opening so there are some kinks to work outgood news  bad news the good news is the oysters were varied and fresh i particularly liked the west coast offering but thats a preference for pacific salt our dining companion had an assortment of the east coast choices and reported them to very good as well although i seldom see so much horseradish scooped on a half shell we also ordered the chargrilled oysters  ok unless youve actually been to the acme in no other starters were predictable but the headon shrimp were generous in size quantity and quality now the bad news staff is friendly enough but still undertrained  eg wasnt sure about wine and bourbon offerings or source of oysters drink pours are precise stingy and a bit priceymost problematic our chicken entree came out dangerously undercooked bloody at the bone and while they dropped from tab staff rationalized in uncomfortable waysgroup consensus well give muddy waters another chance in a month or so  cherrypicking menu options  and hoping kitchen and wait staff are a bit more prepared|very disappointed i know you are new but i think more training should have been given before opening very unorganized when it comes to ordering customer service horrible i ordered the pacific cobb salad when the employee scooped my chicken into the small scooper it went uneven and the manager said to her to take some of that chicken out and make sure its even with the scoop folks this is a small scooplol they are so scared to give you an extra crumble of blue cheese wow forget about the kids chicken strip meal looks like a frozen piece of breaded chicken they throw into the toaster oven the interior of the building is nice enough but  time was enough good luck hope you can turn this around oh by the way dont expect to use silverware  plastic only|went there today to have my birthday lunch it was about  so the place was not crowded at all got seated not far from the hostess station and sat for close to  mins without anyone coming to the table no water nothing the table next to us who got seated after us had a server and water by the time we left got up to leave and the hostess said is everything ok i said no no one ever came overand we went to bravo and had a great lunch i like pf changs in general but if the  hostesses watched us sit there for  mins i have no idea why they didnt do something i wont be going back here anytime soon|my name is teresa and i own a  bmw ci my car had a cracked radiator and it was leaking fluid so i took it to one of your precision tune locations in pineville nc   b centrum pkwy they did an air pressure test for  and they confirmed that it was in fact a cracked radiator causing a leak i agreed to let them do the work and they assured me that they could do it with no problem i have a timeline of my interaction with the location and the repairs that they claimed to have done  jason the then store manager told me that my car would cost  to fix my radiatorlater he came back and requoted me  to fix everything on the cooling system i got the car back and it began leaking coolant again and making a loud noise something that it didnt do prior to me taking it to your location i called the shop and took the car back to chuck they were closing and he added antifreeze and told me to bring the car back the next day so that they could locate the leak a leak that they assured me that they fixed   i took the car to the shop because the car was leaking and chuck told me that nothing seemed wrong because the car was sounding normal at the time he couldnt identify a leak because the car was warmed up at the time he just added antifreeze again and that was it i spoke to kim concerning the continuous leak and noise she had jason the location manager give me a call i took the car back there and he told me that it was a hose leaking and that he would fix it but he would charge me that hed charge  for the parts and waive the labor he assured me that it would stop the leaking i noticed my car leaking again and called i talked to kim and i told her the problem and also stated that i no longer wanted chuck to work on the car she told me that an employee named jp would be inspecting the car i called jason  and he told me to call kim again as she was the new manager my daughter took the car back to the shop at  pm and waited kim told me that the head gasket needed to be fixed and that antifreeze was mixing with engine oilno one ever mentioned the head gasket until that dayi called corporate that afternoon  ext and i also called  extt  i have yet to receive a call back from their corporate office i have been spending money on transportation to get me to and from work and its an expensive inconvenience this is unacceptable and i plan on seeking council with an attorney if no one from corporate reaches out to help me fix this problemavoid this place|i tried the prairie diner this morning because a different place i wanted to go had a longer wait the food was mediocre and expensive compared to what you get elsewhere i had the bacon deluxe omelette and had to ask for no mushrooms was told by waitress they are canned the omelette came with toast i added hash browns and coffee my total with tax was  i like dive places and the atmosphere was oklots of older folks and locals catching up i only had issues with the quality and quantity of food for the price the market street diner offers brunch for  that has made from scratch food locally sourced when possible and includes breakfast and lunch items and desserts|awful service rude bartenders in town visiting family and its not busy for the game they ignored me for  minutes while sitting right at the bar the bloody was awful and so asked for something else they said first thing quick and snappy well you still have to pay for that customer sevice and pleasntless level zero i tip well but yeah they might get a penny|i watching ddd and saw this restaurant on the show i was so excited to try the place out my husband and i went in on a monday evening it wasnt too busy got seated right away then it went downhill from there  had to ask my waitress x where our food was we sat there for a full hour watching all the tables around us get their food i told the gal i was over the wait and that we are leaving she told us to hold on i thought she was going to call the manger over that was not the case she was so nice to bring our bill over for the  sodas that we were drinking while waiting for our food that never came worst service of the year award we havent gone back since|we have been going here for  years every business should be allowed an off day here and there but  times in a row is way too manythe first time it took forever for the waitress to come over once we were seated after what seemed like forever we finally got some chips and salsa and then the waitress finally appeared my sons order came out way before mine so far in advance that he was done eating when mine arrived once i finally got my enchilada and beans the beans were cold and the cheese was not even melted in the enchilada and i had to send it back again cant find the waitress and getting front of house is almost impossible finally the food was sent back by the time it came back again my son really wanted to go home and quite frankly so did i my dad said to give them another try i did the second time my daughter really wanted to go for her birthday once seated it took forever to get service finally someone brought salsa and chips then a huge long wait for the waitress to come to the table when the waitress finally came our order was taken and it took over  minutes to get our drinks when the food finally came out the beef in the chimichangas was tough i had to ask for the side of sour cream and guacamole over  times before it was brought out the guacamole had zero flavor worst meal ever we needed refills on the drinks and chips again good luck getting service from your waitress or the front of house i asked  different people for boxes to go that took over  minutes to get took another  minutes after that just to get the bill when i got home i fed the leftovers to the chickens after this i was never going back dad just drove in from ca and the first place he wanted to go was here i told him it would be a mistake it wasagain hard to get service there are about  tables and  waitresses we placed our order waited so long for our drinks that the basket of chips was almost gone before they arrived dad had the chile rellenos with a side of beans wenchilada sauce and corn tortillas i had a cheese enchilada wbeans and a side of sour cream the chile rellenos were a mish mash of peppers and no cheese in sight they did not put the enchilada sauce on the plate forgot the sour cream the beans were horribly over salted and did not bring the corn tortillas until the meal was almost done tried to get someones attention anyones attention to get a to go box we left wo the box this was a different waitress each time i went i am so disappointed that customer service from the waitresses and front of house is non existent so not customer friendly anymore the food is also not what it use to be either dad said i was right we will never be going back|my friends and i learned our lesson to go to somewhere better for good customer service instead of coming here for drinks the drink i got i didnt like it at all because it was extremely sweet and i could barely taste any alcohol in it my friends tried it and they agreed with me when i asked a waitress walking around if i could change it she said no because the drink i have is the one with the most alcohol on the menu and if i dont like it i would have to pay for it and pay for the new one you go central bistro postinos st francis which are places around that area they will exchange your drink if you dont like it for free which will make us want to give them a bigger tip but i guess cheaper places are too cheap for that i recommend the other places i just named rather then coming here for food that isnt half as good as those places |called phoenix tropical fish to inquire about what they had in stock primarily fancy goldfish the lady who i talked to a couple of times did not have any phone etiquette or manners at all point made i experienced terrible customer service and dont think that i would visit this place at all|i was very disappointed with this complex they initially showed me a very clean and updated apartment she then showed me a not so updated unit the only one that was available i put down a deposit a week prior to hold my unit after that week i came in on move in day to sign my lease i asked to do a final walk through before signing thank god i did so when i walked in the place was absolutely filthy there was paint all over the floors in the bathrooms and on the shower there was also still residue or some sort or sticky adhesives on the walls the ceiling by the heater vent was coming apart all things that i had mentioned on the initial walk through that they had more than a week to correct before i came in to sign the leasing lady didnt even come with me to do the final walk through she just gave me the keys and said you know where it is rightso naturally i did not sign the lease i left disappointed and stressed beyond belief because i had to be out of my house in  days including that day to top it off when i informed them of me deciding to not lease the apartment she did not seem surprised at all but told me i wasnt eligible to receive my deposit back at the time i was so flustered with the events of the day i did not want to waste anymore of my energy arguing i do plan i digging a bit deeper and contacting the proper authorities to correct this issuethe only nice experience i did have was my initial meet and greet with bobbi she was kind and informative although my overall experience was not pleasant|just got my bill from century link the price went from  to  an increase of  per month|i have over  checkins at this place and have been duke for years but lately i see new management and new people cooking and its sad to see them going downhillfoodive been coming to this rubios nearly every week for years although ive been getting the same thing for months two visits ago they really messed up my togo order instead of black beans on the side they put them in my shrimp and bacon burrito not recommended in case you were wonderingso a few days ago i pointed out the issue and ordered the same thing again togo as usual this time the burrito had slices of raw jalapeo inside when it was supposed to be cooked also the shrimp were tiny not the usual plump shrimp but what topped it off  when i was nearly finished eating the burrito i hit something that definitely tasted moldy needless to say i called them and the apologized and said next visit i would get a free mealwell i tried another togo order again today the manager agreed the jalapeos should not be raw and was careful to accurately capture my order when i got home the good news is the burrito was fine and the shrimp were once again decent sized but imagine my disappointment when i once again hit something definitely moldy in the black beans i called the manager who took it all in he chose to react to the good burrito ignoring the mold issue with the black beans and said well im glad this time it worked out ok   really reallycostthe cost is reasonable  for a premium burrito enchilada styleservice they always seem to have enough staff to keep things moving right alongatmospherewell its a fast food chain in a shopping center nuff saidoverallthree times in a row ive had issues so i wont be back for a while|and thats it nothing gourmet meal about this place  its just a regular chinese food taste less cold the pig knuckles is very tough not cook enough and no taste ribs are dry  service is poor ambiance is nice the rest need help|on black friday i bought a bunch of dress shirts for work as it was a buy one get one free sale the representative who helped me kept bringing me more and more shirts here this one is free with that first one you like repeat and repeat  not a bad deal at all got almost  worth of stuff for under  not a bad deal stars given for the attitude when i came to do a return i had a  shirt that didnt fit found a  shirt that fit perfectly was okay with an even exchange since so much of my purchase was bogo well it turns out that the shirt i was exchanging happened to be wrung out at a zero value and it was technically a dress shirt and the one i liked was considered casual wear  really they are practically identical shirt in a slightly different fabricbecause they are two different categories i could not return the shirt but theyd be happy to sell it to me at a slight discount as a concession this annoyed me considering how much money i spend there regularly told them i might just go ahead and return another  of shirts in pairs since i cant return this one single shirt they didnt seem to pick up at that its this general indifference with customer satisfaction in retail that keeps me from being truly loyal to even the best of companies like mens wearhouse|not much to this place it is take out and delivery only no place to sit and eat closest restaurant is on baseline and gilbert|pad se ew had alright flavor but a little on the dry side liked the flavor of the spicy fried rice but rice was a little hard and there were no cucumbers or tomatoes portion size was good though maybe if i had saw the cockroach review i most likely wouldnt have come here|have never had a pleasant experience at this location if you enjoy being ignored by the staff waiting an extremely long time for mediocre food then chandler kona is the place to go do not sit at the bar at this location even worse staff and management turn over speaks volumes i have called in orders that never get placed managers that dont care if your food is undercooked or the wrong thing im so over this location would rather mcdonalds in the food court or going to bjs brewhouse a few minutes away then that hole of a place  even tried one last time called and asked the manager what time they closed he said  we got there at  and bartender told us we missed last call for food if like me and enjoy kona at least the gilbert location is well managed|the man that did my nails had an attitude from the moment i sat in his chair when i told me i like my nails pretty long he commented back that cost more and you want coffin thats more too i have been getting my nails done a long time and im already aware i pay more for my request  when he stated that would be  for a full set medium nails  and coffin i ask how much do they charge for a full set he said  i ask why online does it day  he made a huge deal called over his manager  speaking extremely loud while there was plenty of people around  even after i stated i have the money and i will pay it then he kept telling me people dont pay and he works hard  after that he would rudely throw my hands around or push my fingers down  he was huffing and puffing as he was doing my nails  then complained to me that his finger is raw because if my nails i can go on and on about the horrible service i just received i have now left with short nails a color he practically forced me to get  i will never go back definitely not worth my  dollars|nasty bar with awful service ive never been so disrespected by a bartender before not only was i harassed  seconds after walking in the bar by a bartender with purple hair but she also stared at myself  my girlfriends the entire time  minimum if you are going to be using a card i ordered a beer and asked to close my card the bartender said  minimum i can just close you out  ring up  uhhhh im sorry but im not going to drink   coors light so keep my card open next time i tried to get a drink i was ignored  both bartenders helped everyone around me the managersowners need to be aware that their trashy bartender is chasing money out the door she is the reason i will never come back to this bar wow how embarrassing to have an employee like that i wish i could give this bar zero stars|i normally dont go to yelp to vent in fact most reviews that i actually do are raves this one warrants a review so i can hopefully ward off anyone else looking to score a deal i really wish i did my homework prior to going in but i honestly went because i was tempted by the coupons i wanted a full set of acrylics and know the drill i was immediately sat down in a chairnext to someone else still getting her manicure i sat there twiddling my thumbs for several minutes until i was finally waited on however i was quickly  just one of several customers this one lady was trying to attend to all at once im sorry but rushing through the job doesnt make me happy after arriving home a friend pointed out that there was no top layer to my nails i was in such a hurry to get outafter being neglected for  minutes that i failed to notice this apparently it costs  extra for a uv gel topcoat and one i was not offered this and two even if i was i would have politely declined that doesnt mean you should not put on any sort of top coat gel or not my nails chipped within two hours super disappointed i spent any money on this place they clearly do not have have customer service standards do not recommend to anyone|nobody speaks english well enough to get the order right the pico de gallo is all onions with one or two flex of tomato and cilantro everything is made very cheap with no quality ingredients  there wasnt a customer in the place but every table was dirty makes me wonder about the cleanliness my advicego elsewhere|first im in phoenix not nvlet me sum my experience up in short sentencestook truck in it was fixedbroke down again the next dayasked them to look at it againthey did for an additional  on top of  i already paidleft and filed bbb complaint offered to fix it again for freethey had my truck for  weeks when i picked it upbroke down again the next dayhad to ez pay finance the original amountwhich after the third breakdown i had to sell truck not runningand buy another used car now i have car payments and they want to charge me  interest because i couldnt pay off loan in  days since i have a car payment nowi have written to the finance company and several times to fletchers with no call backs or concerns on their partthey just want to take your money and do not care what happens after you leavenot to mention the fact they deal with a very shady finance company that robs you blindgo somewhere else|this place is just terrible i dont write many reviews but this is sad i live in mcdowell mountain ranch and this is the closest wendys location to me and yet i would rather drive  minutes out of my way because of the lack of effort by this location for years i have been ignorant and foolish enough to come here time and again and never is this food hot or fresh soft cold fries burgers that need to be heated up cold chicken that seems someone microwaved it for a  second period people i urge you not for my anger but your stomach dont eat here fast food is bad enough for us but this is like suicide and in north scottsdale to boot no chance of this going right for you just go to any of the other places right here burger king or mcdonalds chic fil et taco bell jack in the box boston market pei wei nypd pizza but for your own sake not this wendys|steampot was meh  driest mussels ive ever had  crab legs blah  i just realized that it didnt have any sausage in it  my friend asked waitress if they had mudslides  she said no then we saw it on menu  she ordered it  the waitress said oh ok  would you like a shot of alcohol in it  we informed her it was mostly alcohol  she was like oh ive never heard of it  why does she not know the menu|starting on a positive note she did an excellent job on my callouses  however it took so long that i couldnt get the manicure i wanted and it was a  pedicure which was about an hour of awkward silence i do not feel like i got my moneys worth because of the poor customer service and time managementthe people arent really professional or attentive to their clients at all i watched a girl wait to pay with  people on the floor no one acknowledged her so she just left after  minutes of waiting|i go here cause its right around the corner from my work and not much is open for my lunch break at am the people taking orders havent gotten my order right on the first try once food is usually prettyblah even for a crappy mexican place today i got my breakfast burrito and get to the last quarter of it and start feeling something crunchy bacon egg cheese tortilla whats crunchy eggshell ok fresh eggs it happens from time to time but i seriously got enough shell for about  of an egg im done avoid this place i know all of the berto restaurants are about the same find another one|i left my reading glasses at the table i returned  minutes later i was told by multiple staff they had them on the counter behind the cash register they were gone the manager said she would ask around and check the cameras and call me either way this was one week ago i called them twice since then i have not been called im disappointed     and the food well my girlfriend likes it|its always hit and miss every time i get lox they either give me a white unripe tomato or barely any lox today it was both i am done with this place|very weird place wasnt impressed by the food the appearance of restaurant or the service i will not be returning sadly wasted |i ordered my food without onions and the cashier told me that my order has no onions in anything i ordered so i get my food and there were onions in my food i am highly allergic to onion so im glad i checked before i ate my meal i dont recommend this place to anybody they should make the staff know the menu and if they are not sure then they should ask or be in back till they know the menu|previous comments are true  to  of the dryers are broken been there few times same old thing none of the dryers are ever fixed waste of time going there cant wait for my new dryer to arrive soon|to start off we were sitting for over  min waiting for our server and to greet us for drinks and then my wife orders a glass of  pinot nore wine and she was given a cheaper wine so she asked him to get her the rite one then we ordered our food and we ordered a full size order of spaghetti for the  kids to split and asked for extra plates well my order got to the table and he brought a kids order of spaghetti and no extra plates then he said he would bring out the rite one then he grabbed the cheese shredder and asked if i wanted shredded cheese and started to grind it and dumped it on to the floor and filled up my new shoe with cheese then everyone at the table had empty drinks and he walked by our table  or  times without asking if we needed a refill so we had to ask for a refill very poor service and my kids always look forward to the minute they give you at the end of your dinner which we also never received or an apology for any of the mistakes we will probably never come back to this location we have been coming here for over  years and i would not be surprised if everyone that hugo serves food too does the same thing i just hope that management does something about it before they lose any more customers  stay away from hugo section|service was good but the food is not the rice had zero flavor in fact most of it had none unless you add your own way overpriced and not authentic|this place has no cups for the sodas no clean plates to serve our food and all tables were dirty with plates really bad today|it was empty when we got there the waitress made a passing comment about how the size of the menu usually affects the quality of the food which should have been our red flag our entire table had to send the food back and get a refund they were nice about it at least but food wise i would avoid this place|this poor rating is for the guy that runs the headlight restoration a couple of months ago i stopped by to find out the cost for restorationhe comes over and gives me this full load of crap that i need to have this service done to remain safe while driving at night and he just wanted to help didnt want me to have to replace the actual lights because it would cost close to  and he could do the restoration for i advised him we can replace the headlights ourselves for much less and that his quote was extremely high i always wonder if these guys truly believe that woman actually fall for this tactic i went to the walmart on lake mead off of rancho after leaving the car wash and they completed the restoration for the headlights are like new and the service department was great|the donuts we received were cold even though the hot light was on i asked why the donuts were cold if the hot light was in he replied we usually leave the light on i was amazed because everybody knows what the hot light means after several more attempts to get hot donuts when the light is on we gave up save your gas and go to another location oh yeah did i mention poor service on one visit the counter person said ill be right back and started helping load their truck i had to honk several times then someone else came to the window  minutes later and apologized thanks krispy kreme|two times now they have given me delivery time of  minutes and have never showed up i will never use this pizza hut again on top of that they lie and say they tried to call but they really dont i have call logs to prove it pretty sure the manager there is trying to do this to make some extra money with the drivers the manager constantly called me a lier that i didnt receive any calls and then hangs up on me when i call back he deserves to be fired i will definitely being talking to thwir corporte office about this|very disappointed in this place to say the least they are on the list for my sons health insurance so i took him there since its most convenient to my home i signed him in filled out all the paperwork they collected my copay and then we waited over an hour finally my son was called back the second we told them he was in pain from a car accident they refused to see him i was told that health insurance doesnt cover mva motor vehicle accident what who has heard of such a thing i find it completely ridiculous and wrong that they refused to see my son at least my time wouldnt have been wasted if they simply asked me what we were there for when i signed in|we normally stop by here to eat when we r in vegas n this time we have to give it  star ill explain it in a little bit down below dont get me wrong the food is good n the service is alright but this time i have to give this  star we were there less than  mintues ago n my husband asked for a togo box n this server brought out the check n circle the amount of it n have the guts to circle the  gratuity  part n told him this is how much he should tip who do that thats pretty daring n scandleless if u are that desperate for money might as well just ask for   normally our tip standard  is   but if we got really good service we would do  but since she did that my husband still gave her  but if its up to to me ill give her nothing we even went up n told the guy at the cash register  i believe he is the owner so hopefully he will train his people again|the services are really bad  we never come back again even though i and my family  we came here a lot of before  we like the food  but  now the services are so bad  and my daughter is  years old she didnt eat anything but they charged  for her  never this happened before  i ask them why  they told me  they changes the rules  thats so crazy  normally with the buffett they charged money for a kid from  and up  well i will recommend my friends  my family an everybody dont come here  the services are bad very bad |my husband and i stood around for a half an hour we asked several store employees for help but all of them said they would call someone else or told us just to wait the store was empty by the way after a half hour of this my husband finally got someone to help us this employee immediately starting shooting his mouth off about how lowes is cutting their hours and basically wanted us to praise him for doing his job he was super hostile and unprofessional so much so that we left and purchased our washer and dryer from another store|this is the update for diamond chinathe reason is that this establishment has lots its taste and style of cooking the reasons we have been goong for yearsone they renovated then they have new workers and or new managementthis was one of two restaurants i could get cake noodle like i can get from hawaiilast night was the last straw we alway order the same two dish everytime we eat thereminute chicken cake noodle and shrimp with snow peashow is this the last straw you askshrimp with snow peas had no taste at allsloppy less shrimp and no straw mushrooms minuate chicken cake noodle has no gravy and noodles was too wet non the inside and some of the outside edges was burntthen to top ot off the waitress had a bad attitude when i asked did you get a new cook no well where os the gravy on tje noodlesmy hawaii friends stay away and dont waste your time and money go to the other local favorite|its am and my mothers stomach is hurting badly she asked to find some hot water so i came downstairs and saw this place i had my own cup and i just needed some hot water they wanted to charge me  i didnt bring anything with me because i never expected this would happen i explained my situation but they still refused i am not mad at them but feel sad about this not sure if its me overthinking and people are supposed to be this cold nowadays|i have been trying to get them to install remote start on a new car for almost a month they cannot do this type of install because it is too complicated and takes alot of man hours they seem to be good with old school audio but are completely unable to handle push to start or blue tooth i spoke with a manager who said they could but wont even consider arranging anything without money down i suggest going with a more knowledgeable company|service is everything to me i can look past a lot of minor inconveniences if the service is great but my recent experience here was less than acceptable ive been a big fan of this place for along time even before the road kill grill was conceived of so keep that in mind if you order food a week in advance and show up a bit earlier than you are scheduled you would think the food would be out pronto i had a group of  people waiting for me to return with our christmas luncheon food i was told to arrive at   which i did you have to wait outside by the grills when you get your orders here when i went out there were about  groups of people waiting for their food one guy ordered food for  people a very rotund and rude woman arrived  minutes later she too had ordered food for  people talk about getting in over your head on the catering orders i waited for an hour and  minutes outside standing in the cold while one person attempted to handle the packaging of the orders one person at time i asked someone to get the order for an elderly lady standing next to me waiting for two pans of pulled pork the big guy running the grill heard me and got her stuff or she would have been waiting for over two hours you wouldnt believe the behavior of some of the people who were rightly upset due to the long wait time trying to cut into line ahead of others and using foul language none of which was being addressed by the staff of john mulls a pity i will never order a catered event from them again and recommend you look elsewhere unless you dont mind standing around for a couple of hours while your guests wonder if they are at the right party|this is my second visit to pepboys first time to purchase tires it took a good  hours to get them on idk but that seemed way too long and there was no other clientele that i noticed today in to fix a tire and to replace it im still sitting here after an hour for  tire this is ridiculous this is the last time im coming here|after relaying my experience at celebrations to my older sister who got married last year her response basically tells me all you need to know did you go to a discount store nope big sis i did not but i can totes understand why you would think that after hearing about my experience here and for the record this isnt a bash on discount or outlet stores however there are certain levels of expectations for different types of stores and when you chose to go to a discount store you know what you are getting when you go to a bridal boutique there are different levels of expectations and celebrations fails miserably on all of them  i made an appointment there because they supposedly carry the allure romance line ive been to two other bridal stores as well so ive got something to compare this store to i showed up and checked in for my appointment which was me telling the sales associate my name  ill leave her name out of it because yelp is public but i have her card  i tell her what im looking for and show her a few pictures of the dresses from the line im looking for she says yeah dresses like that are over there and points to a corner of the store ok so i walk over and start looking now celebrations has no bags on the dresses and no signs or labels so you have no idea what you are looking at and they have no photos of the dresses some stores have magazinetype laminated photos with each dress so you can see what it looks like its kind of hard to tell what a dress looks like on the hanger so you might miss what you are looking for add that they are all crammed together and its even harder after a few minutes the sales associate comes over and i show her a dress i want to try on  keep in mind she knew what line i was looking for but didnt offer to find any of those dresses for me im not really seeing much as the selection pretty much sucks but i see one she tells me i can take it off the rack if i want what im toting the dresses around myself again if i were at an outlet store id expect that  so i show her my pictures again and ask if they have anything like those dresses basically asking her to help me find them you know what she is paid to do to which she in a very annoyed tone just says no we dont have anything like that really nothing not even close it was obvious she just didnt want to bother to look so you have no strapless dresses with lace in a fit an flair or mermaid or sheath shape in this entire store really i find that hard to believe as those are some of the most popular styles out there right nowfast forward i find four dresses to try on and she takes me to a fitting room and blandly says do you need my help or can you try these on on your own i say i guess i can do it on my own but ill probably need help with zippersbuttons before i finish speaking she has turned and walked out with each dress she barely helped and offered no explanation of the dress or anything every question i asked seemed to be met with annoyance such as does this dress come in white or just ivory super out of line for me to bother her with such questions i know she basically just stood there looking at me i asked what designer one dress was by and she just says maggie ok cool thanks for the explanation next dress i try on and ask who is this dress by she sighs practically rolls her eyes and says ugh its by maggie like im supposed to magically know and im putting her out by asking i finally decide ive had enough and just get dressed and am ready to leave there were two dresses that were ok but there is no way id spend money at a store where the associates act like spoiled bored bratty teenagers the associate says she will put the dresses i like in my file and i ask if i can access that online basically to see what the dresses actually where since she couldnt be bothered to tell me she says no that the information can only be accessed in store now im not dumb i know exactly why they wont tell you that info as they dont want you spending hours with them and then buying elsewhere but they are taking it a bit too far by not even being willing to tell you the name of the designer you are trying on some brides might want to know because they have i dont know a budget they are trying to stay within just a thought plus she barely spent five minuets with me its not like she spent hours upon hours giving me her undivided attention and now i have the stones to go buy elsewhere whatever the store is a crowded little hole with only a few wedding dresses and honestly not worth anyones time or money the craptastic attitude from the staff is just the cherry on top dont believe me check out the stores responses to the negative reviews they basically just blame the client offer no apologies or promises to fix what wrong or to do a better job next time|please dont ever go here if you have kids or a family dont waste the time because its cheap when we first arrived light all lights went out but as we are walking to the elevators my mom all of a sudden hears this man come and scream saying no kids here get out that was the first strike for us when we told him we just checked in we are walking to elevators he didnt care and made a big fuzz second as going into the room everything was as expected but as soon as we were there  hours we heard something in the bathroom the toilet started spilling water out of it and it was actually  other rooms that did the same we waited  hours until they provided a different room it was horrible other than that hotel pool is horrible wont recommend it had a bad experience will definitely check reviews before booking again you get what you pay for true story i didnt have a yelp account but made one just for this crazy wright if i could give a  i would sad the bellagio even had a better customer service for anything i had my babys stroller by a gambling machine and the guy security came by and as nice and so polite if i could of moved because it was to close to the area kids couldnt be and even helped with his baby bags what a difference from the hooters security and screaming at my mom thats   years old what a man please dont make the same mistake i did please|usually these guys have good food but never ordering again they do not clean frying oilgrease do not order any fried food from this place i got mozorella sticks here the other day and they smelled so bad sadly i actually ate one and the after taste was in my mouth for days grossest experience ive ever had i used to be a regular but will forever warn people of this establishment truly dissappointed|i had dinner last night for my daughters bday an i have to say our waiter was extremely good no complaints about him however my food was horrible we orderd  orders of the  lobster ravioli and they came out looking different one had sauce parsley the works the other had almost no sauce or parsley note to carrabas presentation is everything an if a party orders the same meal it should definitely look the same the chicken parm was watery and the other pasta dishes were very bland im not sure if it was because of a busy night  but the manager never came over i would have felt different had the manager came over an acknowledged the bad experience in the end we still paid for the horrible food an i will never be back there i will be sure to share my experience with anyone i know|does this place exist i drove around and around looking for it because i was excited it opened at  on a sunday couldnt find it anywhere i called and the number was disconnected|i am extremely disappointed with the service today at nordstrom the service is what usually brings me in but today it was disappointing i will give them another chance because of the great service they usually provide|this wendys is the slowest one ive been to  i only go there because i live across the street but they have screwed up my order at least five times and last night was no exception i ordered  jr hamburgers plain but one with lettuce and tomato  opened it up and they all  had cheese   brought them back and again told them what i wanted again it got screwed up this time they kept the cheese and added lettuce and tomato with mayo and bacon on all   like wtf|food is satisfactory but i dont like being rushed to finish  minutes before close|well i tried calling them almost a dozen times at  on a sunday for my football party order almost  worth of food but needless to say nobody answers the phone i live less than  of a mile from this place and wanted to give them my money but apparently they dont want it and im not giving them the satisfaction of coming in and placing my large order in person sorry whoolis wish i could have had your wings cause theyre excellent but no one wants to answer your phone|horrible service took  minutes to get our drinks and rolls primarily because our waiter was flirting with women at the table behind us giving them his number and chatting away fries were undercooked and unseasoned chicken tenders were old and dry didnt even want a replacement meal wont be seeing me as a customer again at this location|im staying at this hotel currently the service is absolutely the worst ive seen at a hilton property phone didnt work bathroom sink was blocked up and after it was ostensibly repaired its still blocked ive been asking for tea bags to be sent up to the room all day and finally  hours later they were delivered after reminding them usually hotels serve coffee in the lobby in the mornings over here you need to order it or go downstairs and they charge your room im a gold member and have been diamond for several years i also have elite member status with hgvc this experience is slowly but steadily ruining my holiday in madison|facility and atmosphere is what one would expect of a quality steak house dinner last night was a split decision my guests entree trio was very good i ordered the large filet blue rare my steak was charred a bit much inside done properly this is the second time ive tried it and on both occasions the quality of the meat was very poor flavorless and chewy the wonder bar offers much higher quality even the chain steakhouses do better  id suggest johnny seek a new source of proteins service was very pleasant and timed properly|at time coming brought my  year old and i waited for him for the  he time they have for open gym would be nice if they had a place parents could sit instead of the picnic tables that the kids eat all there food and bounce around on while you try to sit there it was  hours of straight punishment for the parents waiting|worst service ever my togo order sat over  minutes until i asked to have it ill never come back here the cashier was slow incompetent and rude the manager was gossiping with the waitresses while food sat waiting to be served i bet my food is cold got home and i was right the bisque and gravy ice cold my over medium eggs were over easy the hash browns were not hydrated enough so they were hard and cold stay away from this s denny unless you want crappy food and worse service|how can i get a reputable lg screen repair my nephew had a very very poor experience in replacing his screen  he had an accident and of course screen cracked  we went to the desert sky mall to have it fixed and they fixed it but gave him the phone with the screen loose on the sides whe he went to put the case on the phone the  screen cracked most likely because it was loose and not secure  the apparent knowledgable repair guy told him to wait it out that the screen would stick and of course it didnt my nephew paid  and they gave him a  day warranty  we went back within those  days and we asked that he glue the screen on correctly because it never stuck  he gave us a bit of a hassle but did it either way  wait an hour and come back  we waited an hour and he turned the phone over to use glued but the screen has a worse crack on the bottom right   he broke the screen while glueing it on and hes not responsible well of course he turned the phone over and said he we done and walked away  he didnt want to fix the screen even though he broke it very bad service dont get your phone fixed here  what can be done when you pay for something and take advantage of us consumers  im not one to complain or return things unless necessary  we went to him twice and he now stays the warranty is voided since it has a crack on the top  we didnt ask for that to be fixed even though it was because that screen was loose to begin with  can we just get the phone fixed  kiosk station in front of perrona megastore  they dont even have a business name nor logo nor business cards their receipts have no information either  are they licensed at all  how is  the desert sky mall  allowing unreputable unidentifiable businesses to have a kiosk or store station there  what a mess|went for sunday evening bowling with a party of   were told we needed  to get  lanes even though the place was nearly empty  by nearly empty i mean maybe  lanes in use  after some argument the guy reluctantly gave us  all  of us paid in a row for  games in advance only to have the game cut off in the middle of the nd game the guy claimed someone didnt pay and we had to round up all of our receipts would have thought he could have checked the register instead  a manager finally came over and said we were good there are better run bowling centers only a few minutes further away will be going elsewhere from now on|a young lady was trying to exchange a hat  she was previous told when she purchased the hat that she could exchange if it didnt fit  the cashier was a complete jerk and told her she can call the police  she went outside the store and i approached her  asked what she needed and it was just a hat in a size   i told here lets go buy what she needed  went back inside and the cashier right away said he cant exchange i told him i was not there to exchange but to buy a size  hat he told me they didnt have any and mumbled  i said thank you and we took our business to any other store  actually ended up getting two hats instead of one  better sale and customer service  very rude and disrespectful|went here on a sunday had to bus my own tableand waited  minutes for water which never camefinally just went to the bar for service and thankfully joe was awesome food and drinks are great for the price worst part was the waitress who was supposed to be serving us watched us bus our own table grab our own drinks napkinsect apparently thanks to autograt our server gave no service yet we still had to tip her alyssa b according to our receipt although joe was the only staff who made us feel acknowledged and welcomed  stars goes to joe unfortunately the rest of our service was barely even a  thanks joe|i am a combat veteran us army desert storm and have been shooting guns all my life this would be a great range if not for the slimeballs that work there if you are not a member of the rio salado sportsmans club they treat you like trash no matter what your experience level i was literally treated better by my drill sgt during boot camp than i was treated here yes an rso has a job to do but they need to lose the attitude|the host definitley doesnt want to be there  as people are waiting to pay and we are waiting to be seated he is busy ignoring everyone to count his money  after waitimg long enough we left     could he not sometime during this time had looked up and simply said i will be with you shortly      nope and apparwntlu the fact that this lication has such a bad rating shows the employees dont want to be there especially the host|i order a pizza  i live within a half mile away  super close  looking back i shoulda walked  im told  min  cool over an hour and two calls later i cancel because everyone passed out here from waiting  after cancelling  that message gets relayed to the driver  minutes later  i get an angry knock at the door  i open and say hi  sorry man i canceled  minutes ago  then as if he rehearsed his verbal reprimand he was determined to dish out to me  with a pissed off look he explains wait times and what i should expect for delivery time looking like he wants unload and tell me off as i stand in the doorway in my pajamas  half asleep  i get a slight whiff of the pepperoni and sausage pie hes holding in his right arm and dj vu rushes over me as i start to get hungry again however i still say no thanks and he mumbles and grumbles as he walks away looking like he wants to shove that pie right in my face  its obvious he was told i canceled the order but he wanted to get some satisfaction from telling me off maybe ill try again but ill walk next time |food was alright someone at the table ended up with food poisoning from the lobster fried rice its was a very ok meal|never thought i would be writing this one especially after going here for twenty years getting a bad meal does happen but all four of us at the same time what has happened to this place the server was not very good to say the least didnt seem to understand different meat tempsi think she was a vegetarian filet ordered med rare came out med prime rib ordered med rare came or med i asked if they had any very rare prime rib before ordering was told i can order it for you asked if she could check to see if they had any very rare before ordering as i know very well that they run out if it early and would order something else if they were out  she insisted she could order it rare i repeated very rare and she insisted she could deliver sure enough it came out med not even rare looked identical to the other one we had ordered med rare that was med she said she would get me another again i said if you dont have any very rare i will order something else she brought me out another aside from being a very poor cut it was med rare she was getting closer but still not rare let alone very rare i asked if she knew what very rare was she said would you like it black and blue seriously prime rib prepared black and blue i said forget it ill have the ny strip cooked very rare she asked if i wanted it black and blue i said no but very rare when it finally came out it was rare still not very rare but at least it was rare and it was a dry steak not very juicy as was the filet one of us had that was also overcooked  overall the quality of the food served  was well below what i had come to expect after  years of frequenting the placewhen the waitress brought out the check she made a point of saying she took the prime rib that i sent back because it was overcooked  she was to either stubborn or ignorant to see if they had any very rare off the checklike she was doing me a favor and replaced it with the ny strip that i ordered for an additional   there were more issues with the service but enough said just a very poor experience at what was my favorite place in scottsdale to get a great steak and always recommended it for the food not just the memorabilia i guess thats all changed now|the guys on the outside are very rude and unprofessional the car was still dripping water the windows not wiped good so i went to tell him about it after he told me that my car is ready he looked at me like im seeing things telling me the car is wiped down i had to take the towel to wipe down my own car  guys workers came out the mexican guy wanted to snatch the towel out of my hand telling me its not the right towel and the old man came out from the detail shop yelling get them the fuck out of here kick them out im like wow this is how you treat your first time customers|i think i may have broken a tooth on a rock in my mashed potatoes  service was great but|wow never will i order from dominos again the employees are all in a bad mood some guy shouting from the back and peppers and cheese now costs  and something for a small packet thanks|my breakfast needs are simpletwo properly cooked overmedium eggs wellbrowned hash browns toast that doesnt taste like cheapest our restaurant could buy with good coffee and i have nothing against eating in dingy dives if the food is average or better and priced to reflect the dinge the oak didnt really deliver on any of that the egg whites ran like snot the pale limp hash browns were sodden with oil not even liberal dousing with hot sauce could redeem them and the sourdough toast tasted like any cheap white bread no meat but i dont think i missed anything special kind of felt like i had a mediocre  diner breakfast that i paid  forand didnt finish because it didnt taste good our waitress was perfectly pleasant though for point of reference id been ordering the same breakfast at our carefree hotel for the same price and the hotels version was cooked better plated more attractively was similarly abundant and served in a much more attractive space with better coffee more comfortable seating a bit of scenery and actually much more attentive service|if i could give this place zero stars i would the pizza is so absolutely disgusting i couldnt even finish a slice i would have been better off going to costco or going across the street so sunset pizza the wings were dry and so tiny we asked for blue cheese but it tasted more like sour ranch dressing overall it was a huge disappointment i love supporting local companies but some just arent worth it|beautiful insidewreaks of cigarettes as vegas doesbreakfast at claim jumper and dinner at grottos was goodpissed bc someone walked in my room twice wo my consent while i was inside first person didnt knock second did but entered wo me having a chance to answer guess thats normalbogus ass resort fee of  a night includes parking which is free whether youre a guest or not two bottles of water basic internet access for two devices just two really access to the fitness center but not the pool and some other nonsense which would all be more than fine if i used any of it then have the nerve to charge  for coffee which i dont drink but for  a night wld think coffee could be complimentary damn shame|my review has nothing to do with my eyebrows which i really like my review and bad experience is because i cant get back in to do touch ups for months and months i got my eyebrows done in january  i was told to come back in april well in april my sister died and i couldnt go back in for obvious reasons although i didnt have an appointment in april and i probably wouldnt have been able to get one anyway but it took me a bit to get myself together and in july i called to get an appointment for my st retouch and i was told she couldnt get me in until december i asked if they had a cancel list and was put on that i was also told that they didnt have me in their system so i needed to bring my paperwork well december finally rolls around and i cant find my paperwork so i call and tell them i cant find my paperwork and she says i should have come in because im in their system by then i couldnt make my appointment time and she said shed have to reschedule me next available appointment is july seriously july im thinking that if a business doesnt have time to do touchups then then should not be scheduling so many new customers isnt that part of the service i paid for that right i have never heard of anything so absurd after crying and complaining that it literally would be a year and  since my eyebrows were done with no touch up they finally somehow had an appointment at the end of february still over a year later but i took it let me be clear my eyebrows im happy with but perhaps you shouldnt be too expectant of the touch ups or at the very least make all of your appointments before you leave the place and for heavens sake dont cancel any its worse than the dentist office|sheet have a shit can u believe that  i asked them change the sheet but front desk answered me no house keeping now we cant do it|ordered food from themit never showed up even after an hour they called to confirm items on order and told me  minutes  and waited and nothing showed up with all the great reviews they get i wish i could of tasted it|the excalibur is a beautiful hotel and the room is so comfortable and plush but omg the customer service in this place is for chit we have been calling every day since we have been here with one issue or another things we needed or wanted to order and overall everyone that we encountered had a bad attitude  the staff didnt seem knowledgeable about process cost etc and unfriendly and unaccommodatingand in some cases rude its really quite astonishing so in summation if service is not what you require this may be the place for you oh and did i mention we were by their staff that is is a  diamond resort unbelievable|as i write this i am still here at the wynn in the buffet and i  will start off by saying the buffet is amaing even better than when i was here  months ago and my room  spectacular and what a view and the hotel staff housekeeping bellman top notch but then i went to the casino to get a red card i am a  year old man here with family i went downstairs to gamble when i went to get my card i shared  arizons state ids and they told me because of no expiration dates i could not get a red card i was upset talked to mgr told again no so i will walk away enjoying my room and buffet knowing i will never ever everrrrrrr gamble in a wynn casino or share how much ii enjoyed my room and food but instead tell all how they should not gamble in the wynn|terrible customer service was looking into kheils products and the lady in charge of the counter was sitting down on the computer talking with another associate while i browsed after intently looking she finally made an effort to get up after i accidentally knocked a box over she didnt greet me while i was looking and went back to her coworker after i put the box back needless to say they need to work on customer service youd probably boost your sales and get some good reviews if you did i will be going to the actual kheils store hoping for some better assistance and actual customer service|this place possesses as atmosphere of only old people they are biased of younger crowds sucks because the girlsthere are nice|this place poses as a reputable place to have a good time but once you pay the  cover you become a piece of scum this place is a shithole and you are not valued as a customer but rather a number who  is at the mercy of the bouncersecurity guard i am ashamed that i paid  bucks to go here its definitely a club for the seniors who have no voice and dont care about their status as a paying customer thank you but it will be a no for me from now and forever see you never again|severely undercooked rice corn is undercooked too and they gave my girlfriend attitude for asking for a little bit more corn not the best chipotle experience i wish they would be a little bit more consistent|what i like about yama they serve fullsize appetizers when you do ayce  gyoza  shrimp tempura etc while most other places in town do half size appetizers not a huge plus because you can always get multiple orders of most appetizers on the flip side i also like that theres a half size options for most rolls so you can try a lot of things there was one server out of  we interacted with who was friendly and attentive she was great price for ayce is great i think  for lunch and  for dinnerwhat i dislike about yama the other four of the  servers who were rude disregarded items we ordered requests for water napkins menus etc each request was met with either no acknowledgment or a fake quick smile before the server would take off and never bring what we asked for the sushi chefs are apparently amateurs because none of the rolls were cut anywhere close to evenly one piece could be  thick while another in the same roll was  thick the rice they used for sushi rolls was really mushy to where on the side of a roll it didnt even look like grains of rice  just a smooth white surface rolls were hard to chew and swallow because they were really really not enjoyable to eat flavor was good but texture is also so important to sushi if youre in the mood for ayce i recommend a few places far above yama in quality and experience  jjanga sakana umiya and kaizen on deer springs the one on paradise isnt ayce|horrible service was never acknowledged and was never informed there was a waiting list i was waiting for a good  to  min after being told there was a list the guy who was working at pm on sunday december  holding the list took my name and said that there were  people ahead of me he assisted other people after the fact i was already waiting before the others now that was bs he took my name and number and said he was going to call when someone is available which should be about  min so i walked around for about  min and came back to see how much longer it would be i saw three employees talking and not helping any customers the guy with the list himself didnt say anything and sat his fat ass down with no apology he said that they were just now available that ticked me off even more i would like to suggest to get your phone elsewhere horrible horrible service never again going to this place|the last time we were there the staff was great but the cook was not  he would not cook the food the way we asked for which we have asked for the hundreds of times we have gone before  he was rude and should not be so self absorbed and know that we come for the food and the atmosphere i am sad to say we will not be going back anytime to so we use to go three times a months minimum but since our last visit we have not been back over a month and half ago   go enjoy but do not let the cook be rude to you your paying and should get what you order|weve personally stay at the las vegas cancun resort at least  times and this past visit it is clear that the quality of the room are in the decline as well as service at the check incounter our first night we were not stocked with shower towels  of us had to use hand towels to dry up after showering granted the next day we called and they brought up the shower towels but we need not go through this they booked us in a ada room meaning our shower was wheel chair accessible making things uncomfortable we were never told of the ada modifications the lady at the counter said something along the lines that all rooms were like that and i had been wrong for not noticing it the other  times lies we stayed in the same penthouse the shower head had so much pressure that when we were done showering we were red from the jets of water going on given the pressure of water from the shower head from hell it creates a pool of water outside the ada shower stall which we covered with a towel we had a issue with the cc given it is a business card i was sent an email telling me that the card was used out of state long and behold our keys were deprogrammed to open our door fine the problem is that at no point were we notified about the card issue by hotel rather we found out by ourself when the doors did not open after a long day of walking the strip last part going down to the checkin i dealt with a blonde lady that seemed to be more ready to go home and not caring about our issues that we had bought ourselves with the issue of the door she kept saying security thissecurity that i felt she was using security as a way to shut me up from complaining about the room being ada the lady replied with ada means a bigger shower are you complaining about a having a bigger shower wow this lady did not know what she is saying from the back of the counter the company needs to give her one on one tour of the facilities then she said all the rooms here are ada compliant fine its national law yes it is i asked why the checkin counter has no ada accommodations but stated a clip board is used on the other side of the counter to fill papers when wheelchair individuals come in go figure this was the way they treated us as vip hate to see how they treat their regular customers we were even told that security was going to be waiting for us at the door once we got our keys reprogrammed why who knows but they were never there las vegas cancun resort of lies|every time i come to this location theres never been a time where they havent ggotten my order wrong or gave me cold old fries obviously i know that it is my fault to even come back here every time but its the closest one to home and j know every time when they give me regular coke instead of diet coke people know the difference thats why they ask for the diet kind please please please have better service in the future|if i could give this customer service a zero i would  me and my boyfriend ordered this morning   am  we pulled up to the drive thru and as we ordered the rep maribel sounded annoyed that my boyfriend was not sure what he wanted to order  once we ordered she stumbled with our order when repeating it back did not provide us with an amount and than as we pulled up we saw she was on the phone going on about how she cant believe some guy did that so rude she than asked for the second time if we wanted sauce and we told her mild and hot  than marble grabbed our credit card swiped provided us a receipt and pretty much tossed our bags of food at my boyfriend  with no sauce we waited for her and she came to the window and we told her about the sauce and again asked what kind we told her and she through it in our bag and gave a snarky remark about enjoying our food  thanks a lot maribel from order  worst customer service|tldr bad customer service here at verrazano go to pelligrini pizza across the street for same quality at a much better price pellogrini has   topping for  and verrazano has it for  and its no better calling on the phone the person answering thick accent of some sort  i only include that for identification purposes was condescending and rude  set a bad tone for me right away the pizza was pretty good but not much better than prllegrini which is across the street and offers the same  one topping special for  the pricewhen i picked up the pizza the guy seemed put out that i asked for red pepper and just overall was a negative experience i wont be going back as things stand now and am much happier to drive just across rainbow for people who appreciate my business|we were booked for a premium roomwe checkedin to our surprise there was a resort fee of something this hotel was in no way a resorttwo queen beds i guess i got my hopes up we were one floor short from the penthouse suite if they have one or the very top floor  floors being on the rd floor excited me until i got to our room one star for the view at the top of the stratosphere being the highest observation point in las vegas  the ride attractions and yes thats all worth just one star ridesif you purchase or receive your unlimited wristband make sure you use it all on the same day if youre still checked into the hotel for a few days theyre not going to let you ride the next few days despite the unlimited rides you get and nobody told us that we were embarrassed and held up one ride because they had to call management to see if they could let us ride after purchasing our unlimited rides the previous night and we ended up getting kicked off the ride on top of that your pictures are gone from the night before so if you like them buy it that day not the next because they delete everything from the day before and again nobody told us that very upset roomi hated being in the room for starters you would think being on the rd floor out of  you would have a great viewwrong our window is short of half the size of the wall so smaller than half and not to mention turning the ac on in the room made the window foggy so not much of a view to enjoyim definitely not one to complain about anything being clean but our room reeked of some sort of cleaning chemical not as strong as bleach but close enough every time we came back into our room the stench was so strongi mean eventually we accustomed to it but it gave me a headachewe took our shoes off and one of us noticed the floor was very damp i thought it was wet before anyone mentioned anything but i tried to give the hotel the benefit of the doubt and assume that he ac just made the carpet cold but wrong againso we finally just assumed that the cleaning chemical smell was probably from a recent carpet cleaning so i made sure i was only in the room to sleep few more issues about the roomthe bathroom was so small usually bathrooms in any hotel i go to have room to change but here one you open the door and the toilet and bathtub were in reach this room didnt have a fridge so any drinks we took back to the room had to be finished no coffee machine no safe no ice bucket no hairdryer it was worse than your regular motel ill never ever recommend this place to anyone visiting vegas ill only recommend checking out the view at the top as far as the restaurant and bar i hear good things but a star restaurant at a  star hotel seems ridiculous never had i made it a mission to post my review everywhere possible until this hotel experience|locals beware the hotel was nice id easily have given it  stars but to charge locals a  deposit outrageous|terrible experience we booked a two queen beds room with fountain view the front desk was rude and definitely has the we are the best so we dont care attitude but the worst part was that after we checked in the room we found out that they gave us a one king bed room so i called the front desk and the lady at the front desk insisted that we booked the king bed room only she couldnt switch us because there were no two queen beds room available with the fountain view now it wasnt true that we booked one bed as my kids are traveling with us so i double checked it was two beds when i made the reservation however she was very certain and i didnt want to ruin my vacation because of this so i agreed to switch to a noview room with double beds she said she will credit us back  for the no view  so we switched the room it was a crappy room facing the street then my husband reminded me that we paid  for the view so i called her again and told her that she needed to credit us  instead of  she was reluctant to do it then she realized i was ready to ream her out so she agreed to credit another  back what a rip off they play tricks their customers will never come back again|i asked for a robe to be sent to my room and was quickly shut down by management by the name of dominique   i am a gold member of the mlife  i have stayed at  other hotels on the strip and every other hotel sent me a robe  you get what you pay for apparently|stayed at hotel on   for  nite arrived at  pm was told room was ready but luxor charges  if you show up before  check infound out from front seat clerk if room is ready sometimes they will let you check in so spoke to manager and we were upgraded to suite in pyramid it was terrible these rooms look like a nightmare furniture needs to be thrown out looks like a bad version of a super  motel so at this point ready to leave go downstairs to check back out and front desk manager sends us to west tower  its like a different world and hotel better but i expected more from an mgm hotel we stayed but next morning housekeeping knocks on door about  to see if we are in the room my irritation came when she came back at  am and told us we had  min before check out when we responded to her yelling thru the door that we would leave at  she stated she would check back later but when we opened the door at   the housekeeper was standing at the door i will never stay at this hotel again i cannot believe people stay in those horrible east tower rooms and i cannot believe the luxor is getting away with this|i came here to try it out cuz people said its one of the best buffet on the strip but i dont think sopaying  for the good that doesnt even taste that good its not really worth it i rather go to finedining restaurant i guess buffett is just never good|bewarefalse advertisement and ripoff pricing for their holiday pricing we ate there last night  and were seated at pm and they close at pm  while waiting in line i asked one of the host what time they stop cooking and he said pm so figured worth it since wed have at least  hr to eat since it was  they charged more like pp and no child pricing even though we brought our son so for  of us we paid over  for dinner for that price youd expect great food and service but instead we got unfriendly service from their food staff except for our waitress  the cioppino station says made to order so when i walked up i asked for made to order but the woman just served me a bowl from the already cooked pot when i asked about it she just replied too busy no time  wtf this is bellagio service besides its the last hour how busy can you be their holiday menu posted grilled lobster tails but no didnt see any closest thing was crawfish like i said earlier the host told me they stop cooking at pm but at pm the caviar station was already closed  tried to get some frozen yogurt from their machine but they already started draining the machine at pm all the food tasted they were cooked in massive so no flavor whatsoever for the price we paid just ridiculous with the food quality fraudulent advertising unfriendly and lying staff never again would i patronize bellagio or their buffet|hm if u just want something to eat fare place to go but speak loud the young man here seems cant hear very clear and dont expect to much about the food just less tasty food|the crab leg is very bad look like its been there for days and is very small crab legs and the salad bar very messy and dirty and theres not that much food that looks appetizing its not worth the price that i pay for dinner ive been to harrahs buffet before it has changed it is very disappointing i dont know how they got the award but i would not give it  star at all i would not come here if i was you this is going to be my last time here|our food came out cold  which i have no idea how that was possible since it was sitting under the heating lamp for mins  that you can see from your table meat wasnt seasoned  asked the waitress to take it back and she was happy to but thats only because they warmed it up in the oven instead of making a fresh one  the pictures look great  but there was is way better food in vegas believe me |we got bottle service and the club was good until the waiter broke a bottle of vodka as he was pouring a drink the vodka was lost and a price of glass knicked my foot i didnt make a big deal out of it but asked for a band aide because there was quite a bit of blood then the manager pulled us aside and insisted i sign a waiver and would not take the bottle his employee broke off the bill it was  full not great customer service|cant get a return call for days not sure how this guy stays in business|after a steelers game and a restaurant half full received excuse after excuse as the service was slow food slower and we ordered cheese plates and soupwaiters tried this place ill equipped to be successful|ive been here five times and every time ive had a different waitress but the same situation sit for twenty minutes waiting for a drink order sit for another ten waiting for the drink sit for another thirty waiting for our food i have one hour for lunch and every time ive been here i leave without eating there are more than a dozen empty tables there are at least six waiters why is my water glass empty why have been waiting for an hour for a burger why do i bother to keep trying the food isnt worth the wait youre better off across the street at the habit|ill never stay here again unless my age reverses back to  things were perfect until the night club let out we called the front desk and they said police were on the way to clear the crowd on the way in scottsdale must mean an hour|i will not even consider this hotel again the noise level outside from local patrons from amam is completely out of control the front desk informed me it was like this every weekend and apologized i dont want an apology i want to be informed before check in of scenarios that will interrupt my sleep for  hours in the middle of the night absolutely ridiculous|we stopped there for lunch and ordered the donkey nachos and ceviche it was overpriced greasy and i had to send the ceviche back after the first bite it was the worst ceviche i had ever put into my mouth the staff was nice and the place its self was very nice with a nice view if only the food matched the surroundings|came here to give ice skating a try my gf has been begging to go so thats what we did we called ahead to make sure there was open skating available which there was when we arrive to our surprise it was teen skate night lol just what we wanted to be skating in an overcrowded rink with a bunch of high school punks listening to some awful music played by a dj the girl behind the counter giving the skates was extremely rude the only enjoyable experience i had was when i took my skates off and left the front door and to top it off this place smelled like a stinky gym locker room|my hubby and i were becoming usual customers up until this weekend  we loved sam who became our favorite server she is so attentive and personable the menu is rather limited but were willing to support a local restaurant we wanted to share our experience at this restaurant with our friends however once we said we needed a table with space for a stroller the host rudely stated that patrons must be  and over to enter we were just going to eat  he said he didnt know why anyone would think about bringing in a child hey  there are no signs that would lead a person to believe children are not welcome  why would you not allow children to a sushi restaurant  we quickly called our friends and met at another and much better sushi restaurant that had a better menu and welcomed children we will never return due to the rudeness we experienced and i am sorry we will no longer see sam  she is awesome but she is all the restaurant has going for them at this point|went here for lunch the other day the fries werent that great but their burgers were delicious although i added avocado to my burger and it was a mistake their avocado was mushy and just tasted awful that was pretty disappointing pretty pricy for the quality of food|this is my favorite italian restaurant and has been for quite some time delicious food and typically very good service however im pretty sure the last time i went there i was rejected due to attire jeans and sweater same as my guest we got a strange look when we walked in asked how many people and then odd follow up question if we had a reservation i stated we did not as ive never needed one dining at ventanos she said they were all booked up this night it came as a surprise since no one seemed to be dining at the time from what i could see also if they had already been booked up id think the reservation question would have preceded the number of people in my party inquiry so we preceded to the bar and i mentioned to the bartender that the dining room was reportedly booked up for the evening she looked perplexed and preceded to take a look at the dining room herself she mentioned that was odd anyway my guest and i went to spend our money at another fine dining establishment without an issue too bad i really did enjoy this place|i predicted this place would close two years ago how it remained open for as long as it did is a mystery this is some of the worst pizza ive ever had even after trying it several times the restaurant was dirty most of the time and the service extremely poor on our last and final trip they started mopping the floor while we were still there eating late our group and others were made to feel uncomfortable and we left never to return to call this new york pizza is a joke being from new york i can assure you this is not|pizza is delicious however your  minute wait might turn into over an hour and the employees dont care at all|bad customer service employee was powerwashing the drive thru lane within inches of customers cars wetting them as they get their food i called and complained about my dirty car only to discover i need to turn around cause my order was wrong when i got back the guy was still powerwashing the drive thru lane during the breakfast rush like i never even called and complained dont go here unless you want to go wash your car after and go somewhere else to eat|the coke machine was out  the people at the counter are so unorganized  i had to go to counter to get a refill neither one of the guys would make any eye contact and i finally after  mins sat there i said excuse me can i get a refill on diet coke  before going in the resturaunt i sat in my car for  mins  i finally went inside there had been a car with  people sitting in it because drive thru had them park until food was ready  i went in ordered with my husband and  grandkids food ate it when i went up to get refill the people in the red car were just getting their food  how does this burger king stay in business  ive been in food service as a manager  and this kind of service would have never happened|the worst customer experience ever purchased tickets to a show walked all the way in to find out the tickets were for handicapped seats all shows were sold out and all the managers wanted to do is show me how right they were and how wrong i was they showed no urgency to fix the situation but to prove how right they were not even a i am sorry dont use the worst customer service just terrible|filthy filthy filthy i had to use my own shirt to dry myself off after taking a shower look at the pics filthy couch old bed room stunk and was probably from human gas being stuck in the fibers of the furniture  breakfast was weakmini muffins and oj  the towels had stains i would have felt safer if it at least had a scent of bleach from being cleaned  if i could id give this place a negative  overall  dont go here  my baby wife and i stayed here because we attended a wedding and initially were staying in tucson with my aunt  the wedding was in phoenix  filthy filthy filthyoh did i mention this place isfilthay|never get your eyebrows done waxed there half my eye brow is gone and its not even but i guess you get what you pay for they were very nice when i went back to get my money back but just offered to fix mine and get a free card to get them done next time i think ill pass on that|i despise this place if i could give negative stars i would helpful and friendly until you refuse their excessive fees and testing then they treat you like crap unfortunately they are they only option im aware of near us basically the only thing they are good for is treating with pain meds to keep your animal somewhat comfortable until you can see a real vet as others have stated they hold your animal hostage wont give you any updates until the girl comes in with the itemized bill listing all the necessary tests and procedures took my cat there about  months back they got me for over  because they are good at that nountil we run tests we have no idea what could be wrong bs while i was sitting there waiting i googled and found the exact cause which after their tests they said they still werent sure now they need another  to test for something else um no i took him to regular vet in the morning and he was diagnosed immediately they care about nothing but money i understand this is a business and not a charity but these people are seriously shady greedy and heartless was stuck returning this weekend for a trauma injury same crap and still going to end up at regular vet would not have even gone but i could not let my pet suffer so  for a guilt trip and one shot of pain meds one terrible business terrible people dont know how they sleep at nightupdated to add comment to nicole i can say what i need to right here unfortunately being a pet owner i will most likely have to return to your clinic at some point i just hope between now and then that your staff can learn to treat people with respect as soon as i refused the additional testing i was treated poorly basically completely ignored questions went unanswered etc basic questions such as how is he doing when i took my dog to his regular vet in the morning he didnt see the need for any additional testing he was able to use his veterinary training to examine my dog and determine nothing was wrong other than a concussion that your staff improperly diagnosed they told me he absolutely did not have one but of course they werent sure exactly what was wrong unless they did additional tests i realize i was there on a slow night perhaps you have some kind of  quota you need to meet maybe just provide decent medical care without trying to fleece everyone who walks through the doors|absolutely gross  the worst experience cheap ass garbage food with no flavor i hope you think twice before ordering this crap|love starbucks  but this has to be one of the worst ive been toand ive been to many  poor service the orders usually end up wrong and the drive thru is incredibly slow   its the closest one to my home so i go there often always the same service|today my mom decided to grab a quick breakfast we were appalled to see worker outside cleaning windows with another young man smoking a cigarette just  feet from the drivethru window thats disgusting smoke was blowing into our car and into the drivethru window the man was around his late s training a younger man he had a cigarette in his mouth and didnt care who saw what does that show about their food preparation which we dont see thats absolutely disgusting even for jack in the box|i switched over to tmobile from sprint  stopped at this location because it happened to be close to where i was regret going to this location the customer service was very unpleasant the gentleman almost seemed like he didnt know what he was doing i felt overcharged he didnt transfer over all of my pictures  said that they would eventually be on the phone but they never showed up he was so eager to erase the items off my old phone be  almost like he didnt wanna keep looking into why things didnt transfer over i was in the store for almost two hours never asked if i wanted water if i wanted to take a seat  or if i wanted a case or some type of accessory there was so many complications during this process that i thought i was going to be given great customer service and be taken care of nope thanks|i tried vh for the first time to process my elk first their menu for meat processing options is very vague when combined with a new employee is was a chore to work through the options  after discovering that they dont vacuum seal i was told they would at least double wrap the meatthey didnt i was promised all lbs of my elk would be frozen when i picked it up it wasnt  their prices are too expensive for this kinda service  i will not be taking my business back|ashley said  min which seemed excessive  to call after  min if no one came after  min of waiting in the cold dark w my little person no one had come i called and ashley said someone was en route but had no eta my  yo opted to walk the entire way home stay away  uber if i could give zero stars i would|after a late night out i decided to give this location one more try as soon as i walked in the bartender wasnt as friendly as bartenders at other locations my friend and i sat down and asked for waters the bar tender just kind of sat them down i started a conversation with him after about  minutes and asked how he was doing he was in a very negative mood and explained to me that he was tired and was going to be working a very long shift soon after about  minutes he finally approached us and asked if we wanted to order food i ordered buffalo mac and cheese there werent many customers in at this point   of us all together so i didnt expect a  minute wait for buffalo mac and cheese when my food finally arrived  after being ignored for  minutes with no words except your food should be ready soon my buffalo mac and cheese was placed in front of mewithout the chickenthe bartender was very unapologetic about the whole situation i will never come to this establishment again this buffalo wild wings has terrible customer service|please read all the bad reviews never buy or lease a car from  oh yeah ugly duckling  a lot of good honest hard working americans are getting terrible service terrible cars and lies please

corporate gangsters do not buy a car here good day|i have been coming here to watch football cause its the only bar around my house that has the nfl ticket and the morning bartender on sunday is pretty awesome however last night i came the swing shift bartender refused to put the sound on for the game stating its not an important game keep in mind there was  or  people plus my group to watch the game this isnt the first time i have problems with the swing bartenders in this place i hate when all a bar cares about are the gamblers and treat everyone else like second class costumer so if you are not gonna gamble a lot dont bother going to bomas|this is the worst place to eat do not come here unless you want hair in your food the food is disgusting and expensive i came with  people and  out of the  had hair in the food nobody was refunded or was given more food the staff are dumb and have no idea how to run a business|patty the bartender with the short hair yellow teeth and stank attitude needs to be fired asap  came here with my boyfriend and our friends and had a horrible experience we sat down and pretty much was ignored by the bartender when she finally approached us for our order we asked what specials she had for happy hour she responded pabst without even mentioning the wine specials  my boyfriend ordered a heineken and she asked for his id which i had in my purse since it was a passport  i was pulling it out and she kept rudely asking my boyfriend for it saying if u dont show it to me now you need to get up  she literally didnt even give me  seconds to pull it out  after her rude response i asked her are you ok having a bad day  we ended up leaving because she was so darn rude almost as if she was racist we asked for her name and she said patty but i dont work here someone train this lady customer service|i didnt have a pleasant experience with the bartender pattie she came off rude and very uninterested in serving me or my party looked like is could of been a quick place to grab a cold beverage and possibly a snack we didnt make it past hello or so slid right out the door due to the service we received wont be returning|good pizza but who changes their beer system during the holidays   for a bottle of domestic is a ripoffso much for pizza and a beer|if yelp had a option of giving no stars i would for this place my boss and i came here to give this place a try and we shouldnt have gone inwe were greeted when we came in and we ordered our food and things just went wrong from there the thai basil with ground chicken was so sweet to the point where i could feel my stomach disagreeing with me then came the string beans also too sweet and both dishes were covered with onions it seemed like that was the only other vegetable they hadand when it came down to the cold noodle salad yam woosen which i have had many times before it was a complete disappointment once again sweet and the meat in the dish seemed oldi should have stuck with the chinese food when ordering here but i wont be back i do not recommend this place waste of money|sitting here for more than  minutes for a simple prescription after being told  minutes was told were working on it for the past  never again if the wait is going to be that long dont lie about it fuck any place with such utter disregard for its customers|this place blowsrookies gamble  get like a drink maybe  if you are lucky i will never go back to this barlocal ripoffrd time donelocals spend your money elsewhere|the worst choice this business has made was to make you come in to order for pickup the whole point of ordering to go is to be able to come when the food is ready im not sure if this is because the waitress is lazy or there is poor management we used to enjoy his restaurant as an alternative to fast food now it has made itself pointless because its good is little else|dont waste your time and lost your money on casino they provide the loud and beating music to make you losing your focus on playing to win they fool you with the striper girls uniform for the unprofessional dealer to take all your money and make you be the loser at the end of gambling you will never win in this casio at the end of the day they hire the deaf dealer to work on the table to rip off your money because you feel pity on himand again you will lost all the money because of himthere are many ways they tried to cheat and beat you and take your money on this casino so easily never come back againand again forever| lunch special i couldnt believe it when i saw the sign but its real i had very low expectations but the food was acceptably ok  borderline good nothing amazing about it except the price their pina colada for  was really really good had like next to no alcohol in it but tasted like a dessert service was horrid  waiter was too busy trying pick up chicks than serve us unattractive folk|came to to bass pro shop to see santa kids were very excited to see santa advertisement says santa will be there till   we got there like around  and line to santa was already closed its bullshit how they advertise something that aint even true we drove pretty far just for bs|ordered items online for in store pick up  waited  hours after my order was confirmed only to get an email telling me that they were out of stock on the item i had already paid for  asked for a refund and was told it takes  business days to get a refund  yet it didnt take them  days to take it from my account absolutely not satisfied with this target location i will be going to silverado ranch target from here on out|this isnt mexican food i came here very hungry when your really hungry food will taste better than it normally doesthis was very bland and cheese tasted like kraft cheese from walmartim sorry but for mexican place in phoenix in arizona this was very below average|i was so disappointed yesterday when the cashier got my order wrong  wasted  minutes  was ignored by their staff took  freaking minutes before they produced my single sandwich order|i came here for the first time in  years for my birthday supper only to be horribly disappointed by the quality and the manager oscar i ordered the berry spritzer and the first one was delicious the second was nothing but syrup and when i sent it back a new one was not made just more was added to it still leaving it unbearably sweet so i changed it for sangria and was horrified to find it still the same my daughter ordered shrimp alfredo and her shrimp was forgotten the manager oscar came over to the table and told me sangria is supposed to be sweet because ive never drank it before in my  years he never even mentioned the forgotten shrimp nor took off the sugar sangria that was not even drank poor management service never ever will i be back thanks for a great birthday olive garden|good food but service is bad  our waitress frowned the whole time and was short and rude everytime she spoke  i would suggest skipping this place|usually love this place today we had to ask three times for a outside table heater to be turned on which only happened after we asked for the manager our waitress dropped a beer on my husbands lap  she proceeded to blame him for dropping it and didnt offer to comp anything despite the fact it soaked a christmas gift then in the womens bathroom there was a used toilet plunger in the middle of the bathroom and the towel dispenser was out of towels terrible experience very disgusted by the service and cleanliness of this restaurant|very unorganized facility played so many tournaments including the winter showdown this weekend poor officiating sportsmanship and changing rules to benefit their home team   only if theres an option for me to not to give them a star sad|this review is specifically for the pictures with santa you must make a reservation online to take a photography with santa at which time there is a  deposit required you wait outside on a ramp with several other families in the cold there is one heat lamp that is right by the door  while waiting in line i was asked by an employee what time was my appointment then told to get out of the line sand come back in  minutes i asked if there is a line when i return in  minutes do i get in front of the line or the end and was told to get at the end unbelievable santa himself is very pleasant with the children you can tell he truly enjoys what he does  satisfied with santa the space itself is no bigger than  ft and thats where you will take your pictures view your pictures and pay for your pictures super crowded when i went inside there were four other families in the small space with me  townsquare  loses major points for the pictures with santa  this was not thought out and not mapped out well at all while waiting in line i learned that the lady behind me also had the exact same appointment time so they double book so much for your  minutes of santa time while youre standing there viewing your pictures in the small crowded space the ladies are trying to upsell you on picture frames in keychains and so forth next year our pictures will be done at the mall where we can wait in line inside and not be crowded|ate therere twice this past week thinking the st visit was just a bad day for them since they could not get   bento plate served correctly without missing items yet the nd visit for lunch took them hr and  mins to get a  plate lunch and  mini plate lunch order correct which they never need get right in frustration we just left with what they gave us not worth even  star|i came here about a month ago and the food and service was great i came back and the foodservice failed my food was over cooked and the service wasnt great moreover i called the manager the next day and shared my experience with him he told me that he would replace my food and refund my money i shared that i payed with a temporary credit card for the record i never received my refund its ok im not going to argue over  dollars i decided to return two weeks later today server was nice i ordered fried pickles which where way to salty and bacon burger burger was ok the manager came to speak to me and i told him about the credit card payment he told me that he doesnt know why i didnt get my payment i told him i wasnt going to argue about the money that was owed to me ohhhh well probably will not return when this place was called big daddys everything was a lot better|got my lashes done here a few times ellie does ok but not the best wendy a temp did once and i really liked her only to find out she was a temp and doesnt do lashes at any other salon katie did my lashes the last time when ellie was gone and ill never go back she clumped together several lashes i had clumps of glue

or  of the girls are nice that do nails and do a good job but they are too hard on my nails and they started to be super thin so had to stop getting my nails done there too nice place though clean and decent prices oh be careful they will over charge you if you arent paying attention my friend got a fill and they had been charging her for a full new set for months till i was standing there and questioned it|came in about  minutes after being given a  minute wait for a togo order food wasnt ready manager was clueless didnt offer anything except sorry|ive never really gone to blue martini expecting good service however after my visit last night i will never return to blue martini which is a shame because i have always enjoyed their martinis and food we arrived at  and sat inside because it was cold on the patio we thought a serve would come over and see if we needed anything that never happened went to the bar and were told a server would be over that never happened then tried the outdoor bar where i stood for about  minutes and was never acknowledged  not even a we will be right with you nothing i walked away and decided im not giving this establishment my money waited for my friends to finish their drinks and left immediately just horrible service will not return which is a shame|worst service ever the people working this airport are extremely uneducated|looks really cool from the outside but once youre inside it looks kind of run down and doesnt really live up to be hype was looking forward to a nice dinner sitting on some booths but the only place to sit was just the regular chair and table no comfortable dining after a few minutes and drinks being served to us shortlywe were the only ones there we werent sure if we were suppose to order our food up front or wait until the waitress comes back we got there at pm which was perfect  minutes before their special  fish n chips were done unfortunately the waitress didnt come back until we went and got her to make sure we made it in time for he special at pm we gave her our order but she came back saying at pm on the dot the system shut her out of the fish n ship special so i come all the way there for a special i order at within the last minute because she took to long to come back over and when push comes to shove they couldnt even override the price so instead of paying  each for fish n chips i paid  each for my gf and i to eat the waitress was slow and didnt even offer to edit the pricejust simply stated sorry the system locked me out and we cant do the  special any more  i call that horrible customer service and a pathetic excuse for a business i was there before pm and was not honored the  special luckily i just wanted to eat and didnt want to stress over a huge confrontation but yesi was pissed that being said the food was good atmosphere is not so good maybe if you want to go hit up the bar thats connected around the wall that is if drinking alcohol with the stench of fish is more appealing than a real bar with a pool table and darts|told this place we were  a large group high school and warned them we would be loud and put us in back and now they tell us we are too loud we had a group of approximately  and we sang happy birthday thats what i was told was the offensive noise we sang too loud and this is a family restaurant not for the fact the the yard house is a bar  restaurant but come on dont act like this is my moms house we spent in excess of  so i will not take my business back  and i know no one cares just putting out a warning if youre planning to host a large group at the yardhouse dont do it |by far the worst dinning experience weve had in las vegas the place was like a bad cafeteria low grade disgusting fried food very overpriced for what they have to offer|tastes like im eating school lunchthis place deserves a negative thats all i need to quote from  adolescent boys| to come to a presentation and get  buffet tickets  cirque se solie tickets and a day night hotel stay good for a year fml if you come come with no in mind they are worse than car salesman honestly it is worth it but you gotta put your foot down and stick to no if you stick to no then it becomes a  hour presentation if you waver it becomes a  hour presentation we were here from pm all in all it was boring and a waste of time but for what you get its semi worth it|ordered via eatstreet  minutes later and no delivery we call we are told our order is just sitting there  nobody ever made it i order here regularly food is soso like most of the chinese around the area but we get it after tonight i promise i will never order from here again newyearsresolution thanks for saving me  gonna cook myself dinner if it wasnt for companies like eat street id probably never have received my money back|okay food   the potatoes were drowned in lemon juice my request for no tomatoes was ignored and the service was terrible  we couldnt get refills and sat for a long time waiting for them to clear out dishes finally flagged a server down to get our check and she took the dishes  too many good greek restaurants out there to put up with a bad one|been washing my car here for about a year and its been hit or miss but for a basic hand car wash it was kind of about the convenience right well went in for a full detail and this place is a joke they had my car for  hours which seems about the right time for a detail i picked it up after dark so i couldnt see the fine details but they said when bring it back the next day if they missed anything so i figured what the hecknext day i see whats been done first wax lines and smears everywhere the windows are streaked and smudged the interior was basically only wiped and carpet cleaned didnt even vacuum the seat for a  detail worst off on the roof of the car was an area the size of a dinner plate they missed they cleaned around it im assuming the detail guy name was tiny tiny he was not couldnt reach so theres a whole section of my car that didnt get washedwipedclay barred waxed etcand they didnt even notice look for a  car wash if you miss a spot i dont care but when i pay  for a detail i expect attention to detail an auto detail means cleaning out the cracks in the dash board with a toothpick not forgetting to fully dry the car so when i drive away i get hard water streaks running back from the doors and hood so i brought it back and they didnt really apologize but in a kind of oh yeah no worries man well fix it left it there for another two hoursfixed nothing windows still streaked hard water streaks still ran off when i pulled away wax lined still in the areas where different sections of auto body join basically if you want a quick wash and dont care if they leave your windows smeared with grease this place is adequate if you want a detail save your money and go somewhere that actually cares like european detail just down the street theyll do a x better job i wouldnt trust dannys to power wash concrete at this point without fucking it up|since my last review ive only been in this store once or twice due to convenience  after switching to the raydobson sprouts i would say its one star better  but this morning we were in the area and decided to jump into this one for a couple of things and its still the same ol story with the employees  no one will look me or my husband in the eye  a few that were in the aisles just kept stocking shelves and ignoring customers  it costs nothing to say hey  how are you  need any help but i have not found that herei was back by the freezers looking for something and a tall dude came out of the back with his sprouts sweatshirt on in a big hurry and almost ran me over  not a word  ridiculous  when we got to the checkout lines the cashier was somewhat friendly but then she and the bagger stood there in front of us and complained about their schedule for the week and mentioned an employee by name who always screws it up   she was so busy complaining she messed up on her scanning and had to correct a few things  sometime check out the sprouts culture board thats on the wall at the front of the store  absolutely no mention of the customer  just something i noticed and find interestingthis stuff bothers me because i want to really like sprouts  i would think working in a small easilynavigable store that generally sells good products would be a good place to work  i guess i have too high of expectations growing up in the land of hyvee where theres a helpful smile in every aisle and living in florida where there are publix grocery stores which are awesome  they actually act like they are happy to see their customers  can you believe that  my experiences here tell me it comes from the top  if management doesnt care the employees certainly arent going to care  and just a side note after my last review i got a message from some passive aggressive douchebag who claimed a couple of times to have no association with the store but somehow seemed to know an awful lot about that store and attempted to scold me  try that again and ill make it a public part of my review  if thats the way to respond to unhappy customers no wonder i receive the service i do there|i no longer trust rei i have been a faithful customer for  years i tried to return some hiking poles today when i purchased them i was told if they bent under normal wear and tear they would be replaced they bent on a hike  weeks ago i was using them as hiking poles when i tried to return them today i was told that that was just normal wear and tear and they would not replace just bend them back that was not what i was told when i purchased them the problem is i no longer trust the integrity of these poles and will not use them againi shopped rei for a reason the warranty if i am going to receive cheap shoddy products with no return policy i can spend less elsewhere|i thought the lunch was  but during the weekend it is all day dinner price for  per person  the only difference between dinner and buffet is that you get only one order of short ribs and one or two other item  that is a rip  this is not a self serve buffet where you get you own meat  you have to actually order from the waitress and they get it and cook it in front of you the problem is sometimes you want more of one item than another  the items they have are very limitedthe reason why i gave two stars is because they only give you two small bowls of rice for an all you can eat   also i am asian  just like most asians i eat a lot of rice especially with all you can eat meat buffet i dont know of any asian culture where you get more meat than rice after i requested a second bowl of rice the waitress actually warned me that she will have to charge me for an extra bowl  what the what and this is a small bowl of rice it is less than  ounces how can you eat hot and spicy foods with out rice  this might be worth it for  but not for  or  it is not worth it i hate going to a restaurant and feeling ripped off and i felt ripped off here|i love this place but im giving it  stars because every time i come here the male waiter has the worst attitude like its such an inconvenience that we walked in to eat over it bronever coming back|you knew youd have a long line coming in for star wars but you only open two concession linesidiots|awful service servers rushing you to order impatient answering questions unfriendly attitude made us feel unwelcome the coffee glass was stained with some white particles and they reassured us these were only traces of detergent oh and not to worry they were only on the outside of the glass not inside as well eventually they reimbursed us for the coffee but not before they initially tried to push the argument that we should have told them when we first noticed not at the end of our visit it is a mystery how the time factor would have changed the situation of being served detergentflavoured coffee which we had obviously never touchednot going to this one again there are so many lovely places to choose from on beautiful rue saintdenis|horrible experiencei went there for dinner on saturday  december  with my wife for dinner we went there because of the roast lamb special on saturday nights and because it was our special night we even called earlier to ask if there was lamb on the menu  at  we checked in the restaurant and were very well greeted by waitress and host at our table we were given great service one thing wrecked our whole dining experience it was the kitchen manager attitude towards me he humiliated me in front of customers and also in front of the staff  i have never paid to be humiliated all i did was to ask him very politely about the lamb as it was  he went off at me in front of everyone  why do you ask for the lamb why do you want the lamb  he kept yelling these words amongst other things while he was standing at the door leading into the kitchen we will personally not recommend this place to our friends and everyone we meet this was so unprofessional i felt humiliated i would suggest that he is offered some coaching  some people skills and most importantly some manners|your front counter girl norma has no business working with the public she does not address customers when you say hello she looks at you like you have  eyes how on earth did she get her job|ive gotten pizza delivered from this place s of times and have never had a problem i went and ate at the restaurant and can honestly say i will never order from them again sarah our waitress is the most unprofessional person i have ever met working in the restaurant business im glad i dont have any employees like her absolutely awful|tried it last night for the first time and we usually love indian food ordered a take out and even though we gave them the  minutes they asked for to prepare the food before we showed up it took them another  minutes to get the food to us after we got there we got there during peak rush hour on saturday night but there were only two tables occupied in the entire restaurant we only saw one employee there the whole time we were there she was waiting on the tables cashier hostess busing the table etc she kept disappearing in the back for long periods of time so who knows she may have been cooking the food too the food was pretty bad i ordered the eggplant dish baingan bhartha and kept finding hard sharp burnt pieces ofsomethingin it it was loaded with oil and altogether pretty inedible the lentil soup was so salty that neither my daughter or i could finish it the nan bread was soggy and chewy we really wanted to like this place but will probably not go back|another bad experience customer service is deplorable this is the second bad experience we had with rude employees the aisles are congested they were out of stock on buffalo trace but were trying to up sell to a product double the price the products were to heavy for me to carry  as my  year old son tried to help me they said that was unacceptable because he wasnt  yet they had no one to help me i am done with total wine at desert ridge|nice looking restaurant average selection of cigars the food was ok and it came out warm waitress was plain and not sociable at all ordered an yr old scotch and paid for a yr old unbelievable mark up on the scotch ventilation system is bad smoke swirls and lingers in the air your clothes will be full of smoke great jazz trio other than that this place is below the line i will look for another establishment when i am in the burgh|the service and food are deplorable at this zaxbys  they are so slow and unprofessional and at times down right rude  stay away from this location if you want fast service and good food  there is a new zaxbys at the prime outlet mall about  minutes away with much faster service and superior food|not a pleasant experience waitress dropped my food on the table and left it there for me to pick up rather than replace it the hamburgers tasted like they had a lot of filler meat and the pizza tasted like microwave pizza the place was full so we gave it a shot we later realized it was because the beer is the cheapest around avoid this place for a meal|this starbucks should not be in business i ordered a vanilla latte and they gave me literally  inch or less of coffee and the rest of my grande sized cup was filled with foam im assuming it was a cappuccino which i did not order i was pissed i didnt even want to try to talk to someone because every time i said excuse me to a barista they ignored me i got fed up and left this shitty place this is the rd time this specific starbucks fucked up my order i will not return horrible coffee horrible staff horrible fucking service|very disappointed  my favorite night of the year annual christmas dinner with  college uncc couples   stuck us at a table for    of the menu items werent in stock chicken and lamb and i had to repeatedly ask for a drink  my prime rib wasnt rare  overall really disappointed on a special night  the bartenders were solid|not what it use to be weve had more than one bad experience there are plenty of employees working but somehow no one is doing the right thing waiting way to long to be seated to long for water at the table no one sure whose table it is brunch took  hours and not because we wanted it to terrible service gave a  because our food was good just took forever to come out just not acceptable there is obviously a management issue as there is plenty of staff and they are polite eager and capable they were not busy lots of empty tables i think there is misdirection obvious issues on many visits last visit for us|we came here for breakfast on a sunday but unfortunately they stop serving it at noon so we had lunch instead i had the steak and ale stew with dumplings and mash and my wife had the wagyu burger and chips i wanted to like this place since the wait staff is so so friendly and entertaining but the food just wasnt my cup of tea it was very very bland and lacked any flavor at all my wifes burger was hard and dry and shockingly also incredibly bland if you get a burger here i wouldnt bother paying extra for the wagyu as it wasnt that great|no storage room for anything in the room has only one desk still waiting for our refund money for checkingout early  really upset about this they just dont want to refund us|i ordered a con panna and it was just wretched  the espresso was way too alkaline tasting even with the whipped cream to temper it|so i am  months pregnant and doing some shopping for my first child i have always liked pottery barn we bought some bedroom furniture recently  but never shopped at pottery barn kids before this was my first time and the service was awful i was going to get a  items but then because the price was marked wrong i decide not to get it and bought diaper bag only then this lady who was helping me check out was extremely upset that i am not getting the second item she even didnt hand my purchased item from the counter instead she just left it there told me youre done then she left the bag was her side of the counter i couldnt reach it i am only  ft tall with  month of pregnant belly really really bad service if the store is in south park mall i will at least expect someone say thank you after shopping|only reason i stopped in was because i wanted the lorac mega pro palette  and sephora doesnt carry lorac anymore i purchased the palette and when i got home the entire thing was covered in gold shadow one of the shadows was broken and spilled everywherei had to go back the next day and when i mentioned the need for the exchange i didnt even get an apology she just said make sure you check this one which i had already donei also noticed that the lorac section had a sign that stated a gift with purchase when i mentioned it to her she said we ran out of the gifts not even giving me eye contact i then told her well then i suggest you take down the signto which she didnt replyit upsets me because this is a  eyeshadow palette thats not cheap and they act like theyre doing you a favor i know retail during the holidays is tough but they are like this year round the customer service at this location is horrible id rather go to sephora or order online im not dealing with their attitude anymore|this was at gate  if it wasnt for the worker being rude i would have tried this place out this was around am i asked a simple question to see if they can make nachos and she said breakfast only not only was she rude she shook her head and rolled her eyes at me if it wasnt for her doing that i would have ordered something from the breakfast menu a simple question doesnt mean you have to be so rude about it|went on thanksgiving lured by the promise of turkey we arrived at  at night only to be told they were out of turkey really we stayed anyway as the meat is great well took forever to get any service my drink sat empty over half the meal as well we asked if they got more business than they expected and the waiter said no they got less i have no idea what the issue was but we have had awesome experiences at fogo until now wont be back for a while|this is strictly a family restaurant it is very inexpensive for what you get but the food is very generic the service ranges from good to excellent the decour is comfortable and the place is easy to access if youre entertaining outoftown guests this is not the place to go unless you have kids in tow you would never take a date to this place unless you wanted it to be your last date this is strictly a corporate mass produced food place premade food disguised as fresh food essentially a fast food restaurant the same kind of food you whip up in your kitchen if you only have  minutes to cook|i would give this a zero star if i could not sure what the bouncers think of themselves my friends and i have been coming to this place for a few years now and we usually get the table service and we pay in excess of  k to k this time since we were only two of us we decided to just go in the music was terrible i could mix better music from my itunes i was getting really tired and there was no place to sit at around  ish there was an empty table and the guests left i just went and sat there for a couple of minutes the bouncers came running to me as if i committed a crime and walked me out pretty upsetting for them to behave like this with regular guests  that is the reason for a one star  i like the look and feel of this place which is why i come back|this lovely little establishment is located directly across from the security checkpoint in terminal three i was greeted begrudgingly by the staff all of these people seemed to have the demeanor of confused and sleepyeyed teens who have been burdened with the annoyance of waking up before noon to sign for a package dad bought on ebay suffice it to say the soda was watered down and the breakfast sausage tasted like steamed dog penis|ive stayed here for the last  years know all the staff most have been there for along time dont like complaining but recently i was really badly treated by the pit boss when returning from a night out in another casino i like to drink and gamble and use to feel save at this place but there treatment of me was appaling going on my casino record i wont ever stay here again and i dont recomend it if you like to drink with a good attitude|really suck this dunkins is the closest to my house this place day after day has just gone down hill im here on a daily basis and my drink just keeps getting worse how can you mess up an ice coffee really suck i have to drive clear to warner location now |chris and his manager jocelyn in cell phones know absolutely nothing  they went back and forth discussing what the price should be  not only was i going to drop  on a phone but another  on a samsung tablet  because of there incompetence they are now out  with taxes   fucking morons  when a different manager came over all he said is that they need to learn more  are you kidding me  wonder why big box store are becoming extinct because of customer service|with all the choices in the are for breakfast i would have to say that this is one of the worst i will explain why first do not ask for your tip before you serve me i dont like not having to order in a rush why order in line give me a damn menu and sit me down the food was poor at best the kids french french toast was the best thing our family was served my panini was a joke my wifes vegan burrito was so overly seasoned t was almost inedible i highly recommend looking for somewhere else before you waste your money if you are worried about hygiene a comparison would be an ihop with worse food|hour and half for a delivery i dont care how good the subs are that is horrible i will be ordering from jimmy johns from now on|i understand this is a casino and more of an adult establishment however for customers like myself and family visiting the studio b buffet it would be nice if the womens restroom had a changing table  i went to  different restrooms to change my mo daughter and resorted to using the vanity counter  even the stratosphere casino  a much older casino  had a changing table  since m casino opened in  i wouldve expected a changing table had been added|horrifically long wait in the drive through  was charged for the wrong order noticed by checking the receipt  thankfully the cashier was skilled enough to rering the order correctlyfries had an okay amount of salt but were unremarkable  fish had a good crunch but was also unremarkable  im more of a fan of battered fish as opposed to bread crumbed and definitely am not a fan of the processed cafeteria rectangle shapecash only is an awful policy and definitely discourages me from coming here  the proliferation of homeless people around the area does not helpi will not be going back|thought itd be cool to have our  little girls enjoy the view of the planes while having breakfast greeted and seated right away sunday am with  other gentlemen in the restaurant took her forever to see what we wanted to drink ordered  orange juice and water took her even longer to return we decide to up and leave walk by the kitchen and shes just standing there didnt even notice  people walking out of her restaurant i wonder how long until she sees weve been gone so sad wish i didnt have to rate a star at all wow how terrible|preflight  our experience so far has not been the best while booking online we saw a price of  we booked via the internet but was then told that option was not available instead they had a  per person at the same time over  more per person for the same flight at the same time so far not very happy to be fair we booked on grandcanyontourscom but feel deceived either way it currently  and we are still waiting inside terminal our flight is a am and no one has taken the time to give us an update|wowwe use to frequent this upscale steakhouse oftendont know what possessed the owner to change from a great steakhouse to a midprice ranchhouse comfort food establishmentnot a good decision the service is always goodespecially jules but the food is all bakedeven my steak  all the entrees are covered in an overpowering sauce or gravyi couldnt identify my side dishes due to excessive sauce and whoever heard of a caesar salad wpeppers  no parmesan or anchoviesthis was our last trip herethank goodness the sister restaurant

anything from best buy i went down to the store around  and they told me it could jot be canceled or picked up yet  severel hours later i spent almost  hours on the phone with the store and then customer service   the funds have been secured on my card but i cant pickup my order and i cant cancel it wtf  my frustration level is thru the roof  no one cares and no one has the athority to do anything  this is why amazon is getting all of best buys buisness|food was half decent service was as good and prices arent worth the quality of food you get|not that great for the price   people  two eggs french toast turkey sausage side of hash browns   sausage burnt hash browns cooked unevenly  some crisp some undone  too expensive for mediocre food  not that crowded  and   two eggs hash browns chicken fried steak and gravy toast   something  same comment they did not finish their breakfasts due to lack of interest  upon cashing out no military no locals no aaaaarp nothing for discounts   go elsewhere for food|we just moved into the area and were looking for a good italian restaurantthis is not the one  we started with a chopped saladnot good in fact terrible unless you like brown salad and not really chopped  the main course was ok just average  we should have gone to olive garden or macaroni grill that has better tasting food and costs less after a bill of  that included a  bottle of wine we were not impressed|missing deliveries  earlier in the year a shipment of ear buds from phoenix amazon to queen creek were lost  showed as out for delivery but never delivered or confirmed amazon sent replacement which did arrive  last weeki purchased friom a queen creek internet business to my queen creek residence  usps sent me a nice mail saying delivered to my mailbox which is locked in hoa never received whether honest mistakes or somnething else too unreliable for my money  its fedex or ups only  logged in to see if this was an issue with others  from the reviews below it appears so|i have been to this nail salon before management changed i have to say they have made some nice changes to decor and products offered the staff are nice and friendly and they offer a wide variety of gel colors however after my second time at this salon i got a nail infection about a week after getting my nails done i woke up with the area around my nail super red swollen and sensitive after a couple days later the pus pocket broke i have been going to nail salons in vegas for  years and this has never happened before unfortunately i will not be returning|i guess its a new management but the service its now one of the worstwho close the players club on a casino at night |attempted to pop in for a drink but the bartender refused to accept my wifes us issued id even tho she was clearly of age and stated that they would only accept a passport which was at the hotel who goes out on a friday night with their passport first time we had this issue in edinburgh and promptly went to another pub down the street which didnt have any issues accepting her id|just horrible  overpriced no flavor and just all out bad  my fiance and i  shared an enchilada plate and we each got a drink and nothing was worth the price  our waitress said the drinks were strong and they werent  the food was bland  nothing special taco bell would have been better  stay away unless you like tourist traps bad food and bad service|overrated and terrible service no more needs to be said  waitresses was the worst salmon was overcooked|clearly the only reason these ladies are in business are because they are the only ones conveniently located beside the harris teeter where women are in and out all day we made an appt and still waited almost an hour before anyone began working on us i dont appreciate that the owner didnt even apologize for the major delay and even started on one of us thirty minutes before the other im not a fan|i was very disappointed in my meal the brisket tastes old and had an off taste to it the pit beans tasted like just chili with extra beans in it my buddy had same opinion on meal i will say had good atmosphere and the service was good but if they continue to serve sub part food wont be there for long i hope they get it together|been here before and was ok last night was a deal breaker bad service  bad food never coming again i hate to not give places another chance but it was awful i will let a place slide if food isnt the best if they have great service or vice versa|food is ok ambiance is nice portions were kinda small slow service i asked for an extra side of tortillas it took forever it was brought over to me after i was way done with my food we wanted to order more food but we didnt want to wait  will not be coming back|first off i order a cheesy cheeseburger and it came with no cheese when i sent it back they brought me the nastiest looking hamburger ive ever seen it had a glop of what appeared to be floor cheese not a slice but something they scraped off the floor i refused it and got a refund on part of my order the manager actually tried to sell me something else still charged me for the nasty glass of tea that i didnt even finish this is the second time i have eaten at the place and it is the last i recommend eating at the taco hell next door they shouldnt be allowed to keep this restaurant open just nasty food and management dont care|for starters our appetizers never made it out to us since the kitchen burned it which our waiter let us know of the kitchens misshap when the entrees came out they served one of us an extra blackened salmon burned to crisp on the bottom  unfortunately this wasnt the end of our excellent experience they also managed to burn the chicken that someone else ordered fire your cooks service despite all the burned food was decent thanks for the free dessert|bad service over priced its the first time i see tips added to my bill bad attitude from the manager|we tried this spot for the first time with to go food and had heard great things when the food came home the bbq sliders were awesome the roro dip was delicious but the wings were dry and tasteless i called to just notify them that wings didnt taste good and when the gentleman that answered the phone asked me what was wrong i started telling him and he then cut me off to tell me that their wings have never had a complaint and that people have told him theyre the best in town now if he had given me the opportunity to actually finish my comment i was going to tell him that everything else was amazing and that i wasnt asking for anything i just wanted to let him know that they seemed a little off unfortunately he decided to tell me that i was being rude when i said i wasnt calling to argue with him so because of this direct interaction at pm on sundaydecember th sharing this so you can find out who he was i have rated them as a  star for his lack of customer service and willingness to even let me speak we eat out at least  nights a week and just moved literally  minutes down the road because of this person we will never give this place a chance again if you cant even listen to some constructive feedback and then tell me im rude when you cut me off over the phone then you dont deserve the ridiculous amount of money we spend eating out every week when we are literally in your backyard|not impressed food was alright but do not go here on game day to eat and drink took almost two hours to get  salad a burger and waffles and chicken when asked what was going on we were told it is busy and they have a small kitchen food then came out cold to which we were told they had been really backed up i understand things busy but mgmt should anticipate a crowd on game days and be ready to provide service in a decent time frame not lame excuses|looks good but dont get fooled this was the worst seafood udon i have ever tasted seafood tasted old and soup tastes like water horrible|there was an accident at the ups store next door a women whos car was smashed into came in asking for help andor to use a phone to call the police the employees who witnessed the event refused to help i will never go there again any place where the employees are so heartless does not deserve my money|i went on a recommendationi wont be back  i got there at am when it said on googlethe open time was painted over with an x over  and painted  below  so i went to the gym and came back at  or sowas told there would be a  minute  there was one client having a pedicure  they said they were too busy  i guess they dont want business  i went elsewhere|ok ive said this before about fast food and ill need to say it again not that im trying to be a jerk but from a former restaurant manager perspective also im not one of those nightmare formers but i am one of those who remembers who it is who pays the bills i dont think fast food understands it anymore im not sure who is at fault perhaps business and customer both i dont have the room here to go into detail so here it is why am i the one who is the one saying thank you in the drive thru windows for what handing me a bag i came to you i gave you money i gave you business people we need to be saying youre welcome to the business thank you but we cant can we because it is rare to receive a thank you from fast food drive thru windows the girl handed me a bag and said nothing what happened to even common courtesy i guess we dont get that unless you start making  an hour youre right my bad thank you thank you thank you so much for your tireless and under paid efforts in handing me a bagthank you thank you thank you|after reading the good reviews and with it being so close i had to try it i had high hopes since i love chinese but where do i beginthis is my first negative review and one of few bad experiences ive ever had one star for the guy at the counter being nice thats all i could say is a positive the place was empty save a small old tv in the corner with a taped over vhs player the food can we call it that ive been to over  other chinese restaurants in the valley alone and this is the worst chinese i have ever had the rice was dry falling off my fork the noodles tasted awful nothing was fresh as a former chef i can tell you that it all sits at temp until ordered the king pow was hot and tasteless if it had been fresh it wouldnt  be so soggy the crab puffs had no crab just cream cheese with no flavor my teriyaki chicken was just chicken covered in a sauce from a bottle even the white rice was over cooked from sitting all day i dont care if its am or pm you dont just serve stuff sitting around all day in conclusion i really wish it was good but ill settle for the other awesome places a few miles away|i rarely ever give a bad review but the pizza at this place is way over priced and not good i paid  for a  pizza thinking that it should be the best ever you get what you pay for i thought i was eating a frozen pizza from walmart i should have known when the place was empty at noon when i asked about a senior discount they said that you have to ask for it before you order anyway if you want a pizza with perfect crust that will melt in your mouth go across the street to native wings you will not regret it|i had called in an order here and everything seemed good just ordered some breadsticks for delivery and when the delivery person got here she was very rude and kind of a jerk to me saying next time we wont deliver with such a small order which if that was true the person who took my order should have told me and if that was the case i would understand but the way the delivery person said it has turned me off from ordering from this location ever again ill just order from papa johns from here on out when i order from them and just get breadsticks they will deliver to me with no problem and the part thats really annoying is that the place i have them deliver to is literally right across the street dont order from this location|this shop is a mixed bag of broken machines and not having the ingredients in stock im at the store right now and the open sign is off even though they dont close for another  hours ive been here multiple times when ive had the hit or miss luck or getting what i want or having to order only what they have available if there was another juice shop close i would be there instead no dice there though|the only complaint i have is the rice its not cooked they need to check it before serving it or else it ruins the whole burrito|awesome food but the place is super dirty you have to go through the kitchen to get to the bathroom which is pretty disgusting but my food is always amazing i probably wouldnt recommend it for cleanness but good food|if i could give one star i would there are so many nail salons in the area i dont understand how this one could be in business they are rude and do a half ass job i shouldve looked at the reviews before coming here save yourself your time and money and go somewhere else|i would usually fill up my gas tank nd get cash from the chase atm machine every monday morning but now they have some wacky atm machine that charges to withdraw money qt just lost my bussiness|this visit no straws with drinks last visit no fork for the salad but hey i got a knife what am i supposed to do with that stab myself in the eye both times were thru the drive thru train train train its not rocket science|food takes forever we waited almost half an hour for some fast food that tastes worst than a tv dinner i ordered a mini garlic shrimp that had  tiny shrimp in it if you are going to give me  shrimp they better be big prawns not salad shrimp my wife ordered chicken katsu and shrimp tempura they didnt give her any katsu sauce for her bland chicken and the tempura looked like the frozen ones from costco what a joke never coming back here to go boxes were piling up they dont know how to manage the food that is put out by the kitchen i understand that you guys deliver but if the delivery guy is not back then give the customers sitting in your restaurant their food|five star hotel with a three star service not very impressed i had the studio which was nice but literally had no house keeping i had to call the guest services to get the room cleaned called them for a late check out on sunday and they were not willing to be flexible and wanted to charge me an additional  for an additional two hours of late check out seriously also the carpets around the common areas and the hotel room were stained they could definitely change carpets to make it look clean otherwise the room itself is pretty clean and i had pretty good views of the bellagio fountain from the balcony which was pretty cool we had free entry to marquee and the line was pretty short for hotel guests i am giving a two star rating because of the lack of quality that we can expect from a five star hotel|staff at the front very nice  i was check in today at  but when i walk in to the room is big surprise the room not clean yet  i so tried need to go to bed they said they will sent maid in  here is  star hotel  it is unbelievable|let me make this clear the cosmopolitan of las vegas use to be my favorite hotelcasino as ive stayed there over the last few years during my vista to las vegas i was a target by their security staff in   upon my yearly trip in  i decided to give the place another chance only to have the exact same thing happen at the same bar in the hotel bookman stage i was yet again a target because i was a woman playing s in the machine  not drinking as i was told by their security i was surrounded by  one security guard   other police officers other women were at the bar why was i yet again a target was it because i was black i was dressed in jeans and flip flops and had been playing at the hotel the entire day even staying at the hotel this first time i was profiled after reaching out to management about the incident i was yet again taken back by the response ive been too sadden to even show the video from that night but i ask many to be careful before stepping foot in that building not to add i was also harassed by the las vegas police after reaching out to them for help because of what occurred i cosmo this wasnt by coincidence i also have two witness  thecosmoplitanoflasvegas sucks|beautiful hotel mediocre rooms terrible serviceduring my most recent trip to vegas i was super excited to stay at the cosmo i had been to the hotel to eat and gamble and loved the decor and ambiance after we checked in and got to our room i was underwhelmed the room wasnt very large the window was tiny and there wasnt a lot of natural light the carpet also looked pretty worn down for a hotel that has only been around since  the room also had terrible sound insulation and we could hear anyone walking down the hall as if they were standing right next to us the next morning we noticed that the safe was already locked we picked up the phone to call downstairs but the phone was broken we ended up calling from our cell phone and reception said that they would send someone to open the safe in about  minutes we wait  minutes and call again the front desk tells us they are on the way to our room  minutes later someone comes in and fixes the phone we wait another  minutes and call again and the front desk says they will be at our room in about  minutes since a security guard needs to be present when opening a safe another  minutes and another call apparently they are already on the way to our room meanwhile the technician that fixed our phone comes by to tell us that he contacted the technician who opens the safe and that hes on an emergency and wont be free for at least  more minutes wtfi am outraged since i already wasted over an hour waiting the issue is not anywhere near resolved and im late to meet my friends for lunch i go downstairs to the front desk and ask for the manager on duty and she apologizes with no explanation and says that if we know what time well be back they can prioritize our work order in front of others it seems like this could have been easily avoided if someone had done their job properly and checked that the phone was functional and the safe was open instead we were left wasting our time on what seemed like a wild goose chase why was it that no one at the front desk knew what was going on why tell us that someone is on their way to our room when clearly there was no one available why wouldnt you give a more accurate estimate of the amount of time that a guest has to waiti gave up and had no functional safe during the remainder of my stay  stars overall minus  star for the horrendous service i would not stay here again given that there are a ton of better choices in vegas|post comment due to post problems with repair after i drove away just spending  for labor and parts the just replaced clutch was not working properly thank goodness for the internet i started researching realizing and suspecting i had been hosed had to spend another  to get the car running properly  exhorbatant upcharge on parts not happy|you know when you walk into a place you can tell how much employees dislike their job yup that was what i experienced walking into this location it was cool that we were greeted right away and told to see him sam at the register for help noticed he was still doing some paperwork for a previous patron so no biggie i just stood by and waited until he was ready explained to him that iphone wasnt working properly with wired or wireless headphones and that i had gotten it diagnosed at the apple store but didnt want to cause any problems if they had switched it out for me considering it was on their jump plan he was blankly listening to me with glazedover eyes that students give in class well i found out that i couldve switched it at apple with no problem and he was happy to send me on my way so i had to insert a but statement i was already there and wanted them to do it  i love going to apple for their customer service but the next appointment i couldve gotten was for next week  to process it was honestly nothing if i could just get it processed asap and through the mail oh yeah thanks for not inquiring if i wanted to pay the fee there even though you saw me ready with my wallet out i think the saving grace was a manager that playfully called him out for looking a bit lost also kinda helped walk him through on how he was supposed to get my phone replaced she even answered my moms inquiry about looking for older iphone generations cases happily all about attitude a representative could give me bad news like i wouldve had to pay the full fee for my phone but i wouldve been completely cool with it so long as they were nice and courteous showing some empathy|manipedi was good not great there was no massage just rubbing but the color was good so its fine however i made the awful mistake of getting my eye brows done since i was already here so bad my eyebrows are completely butchered there is barely any hair left and i already have very sparse eyebrows to begin with not to mention i am going to belize on wednesday for vacation i am not usually one to get overly upset about these things but they seriously look so bad that i got into my car and cried please do not make the same mistake for nails its fine but do not get your eyebrows done here unless you want to walk out with barely any hair left|well basically i like dunkin though it was a quite bad experience with a guy who took my order up front i was in need of taking some doughnuts out and placed an order then checked out then was watching the guy picking up  from the shelf omg he was working with gloves that  have touched on the currencies i got from him when checked out he didnt change the gloves or use any sort of supplies in clean to do the job it was such dumb sorry ill never get here again|absolutely  the worst place on this earth okay over exaggeratingfor years i have suffered neurological complications due to hivaids complications which require me to have service animals my service animals do the job they need to do and after that  they are what they are  dogs i entered an agreement with arzano on april  regina g being my leasing agent there has been many emails and voice exchange with regina  especially about my service animals when it came to sign my lease  regina wasnt there and there someone else that took her place for the day the previous lease that was made by regina was incorrectly made  according to the leasing agent that took over reginas spot for the day i was charged for my service animals  and charged for rent for my service animals which they stated they would fix it and it will be applied towards the end of my contract after that  made sense i could have a credit on my account to take care of any damagesafter my husband got orders from the military to change stations  i submitted my  day notice with the orders after i got my bill it was  worth of damages  which was kind hefty because  the laminate flooring was already damaged and since i moved my unit was completely filthy and since wendy was on vacation when i moved in  i assume that did not do a exit inspection with the previous tenant of the unit now comes the claims for the fees charged my service animals   months passed by and their residential services which is their rd party legal department denied my claim blaming me  turning things around and accusing me for not handling it while i was there that i signed the contract  however the contract was remade twice  and i still had a doctors note and my claim was made prior of moving inwhen attempts to dispute with the property manager directly  they will reject your certified maili am out  in pet fees and plus  on their final statement i employ you folks  do not move here  you will regret itwhen my spouse gets back  we will be consulting with the navys legal department they will not only have to answer to lawyers but with the addition of the department of justice when we bring this to their attention i am going through all this  just because some jerk refuses to admit their mistakes again  do  not  move  here  avoid ovation properties and especially this property  if they fuck up  its your fault and make it out like your the bad person this company is nothing but a fraud they will reel you in  show this face to you|terrible all around weve been here throughout the years but this time will be the last waited an hour to get into take pictures when we had multiple small children that were losing it then our photographer did a terrible job of working with kids and did a rushed job with one backdrop to top it all off when we got done taking pictures we were told it would be  minutes until we see our pictures we waited  minutes and then i asked how much longer it would be and they apologized and said they didnt realize we havent been assisted when a manager is in we will call to hopefully get some reassurance on some of these issues thats the only thing that would raise this review|must buy their card for  bucks does not accept debit or credit card to load money on their card not worth going there if youre only going there once|i would say a majority of the thousands of people that fly into las vegas every day dont realize they are taking a gamble even before stepping foot into a casino lets call it taxi cabi played and lost during my latest trip the cabbie had the nerve to tunnel me to mandalay bay even after i told him i come to vegas multiple times a year during the mandatory banter that typically accompanies being long hauled mandalay bay is the closest hotel to the airport it is literally across the street from the airport it is the most blatant abuse of the tunnel possible when staying on this side of the strip it takes a very ballsy or equally stupid driver to attempt to long haul someone especially at pm on a week day when there is no traffic at all as soon as i noticed we were in the tunnel my blood began to boil did he really just do this youve got to be kidding me i had already pulled up the proper documentation for filing an affidavit on my phone before we got to the hotel i asked for a receipt as i was paying in cash the driver handed me a blank card with no information on it at all this is the point he realized he screwed up i handed it back and told him to fill it out he some wrote random bullshit on it and handed it back to me and promptly sped off before i could get the taxi cab authority on the phone the first thing i do upon entering a taxicab in las vegas is enter the cab number the company the time and anything else into my phone for this very reason regardless of what he wrote or didnt write i had his informationthe best thing to do is inform the driver you are aware you were long hauled once you arrive to your destination and that you have all of the drivers information this will usually result in the driver making you a cheaper offer or declining any payment under the expectation you wont be reporting them you can call the taxicab authority before paying if needed as well hotel bell hops  taxi stand attendants are also probably experience with handling long hauling as well and will usually be of assistancealways report them let them know you are reporting them there is no excuse for taking advantage of tourist in a city that thrives on its tourism you dont bite the hand that feeds its sad to think how many people get taken by this brazzen scam daily|dishonest  had a nail in the tread  they told me i had a leak in the side wall when i asked them to show me the leak the man told me see right here the tread is low  the tires were only one month old and had new tread  took the car somewhere else to get it fixed  would recommend walking before using these crooks|this used to be my spot the new management took over and all the good people are gone since lt is known for their great nails it is busy i dont think everyone is aware of the new management however my friend made an appointment and since they are trying to cram so many people in at the same time she waited  mins after her appointment when i was getting my nails done the woman who was doing them was going so fast that she fucked up the shape of my nails she said sorry i am rushing we are busy i said i am paying money to get my nails done not getting them for free she laughed and said why you mad put smile on your face you get good nails today and when i washed my hands she told this walk in to sit down and spent  minutes on her nails before finishing mine so pissed that i have to find another nail place she said next time we do better there will not be a next time|dr tabossi in my experience  had my pregnant wife there  hours waiting on her  hours  and this was a normal thing the st visit will be about a hour nd visit once they can charge you its gonna be a while i suggest bringing a lunch i dont want to see anyone get so upset like we were my wife was so upset i was worried about her eating and being so uncomfortable sitting and waiting  hourswho does that  this lady is a sociopath hour wait  and oh yea if you dont want to wait the super rude staff will inform you that you will be chaged anyway  sand dr tabossi purposly put my wife ied so sex is uncomfortablein my experience i wish i didnt ever go here shame on you making people wait  hours you are sick hope people read this so they are forwarned|take your business elsewhere my boyfriend purchased a lovely pair of pearl earrings as an anniversary present the backings were loose and after a few days i had noticed one earring had fallen out of me ear i called ben gioielli and spoke to tiffany the saleswoman who had sold my boyfriend the earrings she had me send back the earring so that they could find a matching pair then radio silence for  months the only communication i had was when i called twice to follow up on the status of the search i finally insisted on speaking with the manager joanne and magically the earrings were being shipped out the next day with the promise that the backs were much stronger after wearing them for  minutes i reached up to my ear and found one of the earrings dangling precariously out of my earlobe the back missing i left another message with the store and requested a call back from joanne four days later she leaves me a very condescending message about how she finds it very interesting that the earrings are continuing to fall out given that she checked the backs herself and had another coworker do so as well she then proceeded to give me a little how to wear earrings  reminding me to make sure that the backings were pushed all the way up to my ear and to be careful when pulling things over my head thanks she did say that shes sending along an extra pair of backings but i have zero faith in their product i will be taking this to my jeweler at home who knows what hes doing piss poor customer service and a jeweler who is apparently baffled at how to make earrings that stay in your ear there are plenty of highend jewelry stores elsewhere that create beautiful pieces that wont fall off your body due to shoddy workmanship if you consider buying something from ben gioielli try claires first youll get the same quality for a fraction of the cost|horrible i came in at  pm and the older woman kim told me they closed at  and shed get me in and out in no time long story short iwas the only customer and she rushed and was mad because she wasnt clear about the tip theres a sign saying cash tip only i noticed it about  minutes after she started on my nails she told me not to worry i can use my debit card great when the time came i paid with debit card waited for my receipt so i can tip but it never printed i asked about it and she yelled at me for not tipping i was confused as to why she was yelling then she started to speak vietnamese to her coworker and slamming things around as my nails were still drying she told me to leave and go home i told her my nails werent dry and she huffed and puffed and said get out i grabbed my purse and left i got into my car and turned my heater in full bast and dried my nails for another  minutesone star because she was rude and unclear about the tip policy they have also they closed at  pm and she rushed the entire time i was there my nails looked horrible never going back|i havent eaten here in over two years but decided to give them another shot and the food is just terrible bbq spare ribs so dry and the fried rice is just not good reminded me why i have avoided eating here|ive been waiting for two hours for my car to be cleaned while the kid cleaning is off flirting with another worker my car is small it shouldnt take two hours to clean seriously i watched  quarters of a stupid football game so far waiting no update or anything overly priced for a car washits officially been three hours cashier said it shouldnt ever take that long but here i am still waiting joey and all his buddies should stop messing around and do what theyre paid to do joey youre always wanting to go home early so its like youre almost done im trying to go home too shit|not impressed like other robertos the cheese doesnt come with the shrimp burrito i find that odd because thats the way its supposed to be made the location on nellis and stewart stays true to the original menu and they dont arguethe second time at this place was just  days ago ordered  sausage breakfast burritos the burritos were not good they were filled with deep fried potatoes  dry and deep fried sausage  dry a little cheese and next to zero eggs they were wrapped crappy and then wrapped in paper so sloppy that they fell out in the bag all the ingredients are supposed to be cooked on the grill with the egg to sausage and potato mixture is supposed to be  the whole thing was dry and hard to choke downhonestly in the whole vegas valley only the robertos at nellis  stewart gets every item cooked correctly and tastes amazing other locales are going to have to step it up very disappointing i have to drive  mins for good mexican fast food|service is crummy and the food mediocre  the pub burgers so so with shredded iceberg its more mcdonalds than  upscale  and cheese will cost you  bucks more  compound the lackluster service mediocre food and  taps and its a pass|aside from the young guy doing the xraythis place is a joke upsell upsell upsellmore time and effort is spent trying to get into your pocket than what youre originally there for office staff obnoxious and rudeone of them thought we all would appreciate her tracy chapman impersonationnot just a bit the whole effing song another eastern european accent kept interrupting my xray time asking the tech for point spread advice on some basketball game unprofessional crass and patheticif there was a half star id give it hey young guy on xrayget outta there|kinda disappointed the shop is on the small side and not very apple bottomed friendly i needed a fill in and a nail repair i received the fill in but im assuming she didnt feel like doing the nail repair i was over charged for a simple design and the process just took too long its only been  days and my fill in is already starting to lift up so mad right now a waste of my freaking my money|im still in disbelief of the horrible customer service i received when i attempted returning some records that i got from the eastern location i bought the records  days ago and when i got home to listen to them on my new turntable they both skipped like crazy right after hearing the skips i went online and bought the same records on amazon to replace them after getting them in the mail i called ahead to ask this location if i could return items i got from eastern and they said that would be fine when i got there a manager told me that they could not accept opened items to be returned and she went on to explain and she repeated the same thing to me four times that if i adjust the weight of my needle that the record would probably play properly she kept explaining that same thing to me at every attempt that i made to object to the nonsensical return policy and she ended the conversation by saying that is the reason why nobody really listens to records anymore super disrespectful and unprofessionalhow would i have known that the records were defective if i had not opened and listened to them she offered the option to sell the records back to them but why would i do that if i literally just bought them three days ago for full pricei went home to listen to the same records that i got from amazon and alas no skips please do not even take a risk on getting records from zia|i tried to get snacks but despite there only being  people in front of me i waited in line over  minutes i couldnt wait any longer because the movie was going to start so i had to leave i should of brought something from home we go to the theater only a couple times a year so we really wanted it to be a good experience too bad they cant figure out how to get lines to more a little quicker|well we were there  minutes and never got served we asked if they were still serving food and they made an excuse with it being busy wont ever go back there even the people around us made comments about us not getting helped very disappointed|worst experience ever they closed half the restaurant at the start of a football game and told us they couldnt accommodate a party of  the bald bartender was such a extremely rude to my friend when she asked how she could get service i will never come back here not even if i was starved for  days|le dcor est beau et les siges sont comfortables part ca jai t assez dcue le cocktail ntait pas vraiment bon trs sucr mais en plus un certain

security were  yards long if they let people in earlier they may buy more eat mote and drink more expensive poor food choices  ive gone to  other nhl arenas and this seemed one of the worst  i miss the civic arena and the ole igloo clubas for sight lines it is set up like the staples center in la lower level seats are great the luxury boxes have a good view but the upper level are in another time zone i just went to an anaheim ducks game against the penguins and the experience seating and food was much betterthe ushers were great helpful friendly and kind im from pittsburgh originally and wanted this to be a worldclass venue but sadly it is a new building with minor league execution|food is served cold  party of six waited  mins to get  person food and the rest came out  mins later  send my food back and was question  times why  do not waste your time at this place|its funny looking back at my old review i even posted a photo of the food which i loved so much unfortunately that has all changed it has been slowly going downhill the last three times ive eaten at thai chili this last time was so disappointing that i had to update my review i love eggplant in thai food so i usually order the spicy eggplant at thai chili tonight i ordered it as a  on the spicy scale of  and it was not spicy at all it even says spicy in the title if you like salt this is your dish there were no flavors recognizable in the sauce the only thing it tasted like was salt and every vegetable piece of tofu and rice all tasted like salt the eggplant pieces were unrecognizable from the mushrooms as they were so saturated in the salty sauce i used to love their eggplant and make sure to savor the eggplant slices i should have taken a picture of my dish tonight so you could compare to my old one they dont even look the same i am giving thai chili  stars because the service is good and they do give you large portions that is what is keeping me from giving them  star|my best friend syed describes the sauce as having a fervent after vomit tastemy tater tots are microwavedmy eggs are coldthe pepper jack cheese is straight from a bagthe guacamole is browndo with this information what you will i hope that i have herein been able to rescue you from one of lifes small pains|what a joke overpriced bland food i ordered a  oz strip and it was tough as nails bison might actually be softer now normally in most establishments when you order a main meal it should come with a side or a salad well guess what i was charged  for a side and  for a salad which tasted like raw seaweed the mash taters tasted a day old and there was no amount of spice or garlic that made them taste any better ive been to classier steakhouses and none of them were such a complete waste of money like this one and dont charge extra for regular sides if you do so please inform the customer that they are buying the steak and the sides are extra service was good though hence the only star im giving this place|i had ordered takeout for  a family meal of  pieces of chicken   sides and  biscuits  for a family get together i drove  mins each way for thisand spent  only to realize when i got home already that they short me  pieces and also almost forgot one of my sides which i had to mentioni was really upset because there wasnt enough to feed everyonedisappointing|so freaking loud here i understand its vegas but i felt like my head was about to explode and i almost lost my voice after yelling throughout the dinner may be we should have become one of those couple who just text seating next too each other but getting to the food  the food was awesome the only problem is that we didnt want to seat there long enough to really enjoy it pretty much ate it as fast as we could and planned our escape out amazing how something so small like super loud music can ruin your dinner experience  the decor is pretty cool though loved the cows|
