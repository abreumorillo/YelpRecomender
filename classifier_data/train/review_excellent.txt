chimney sweep did both  clap  clap  claplets get to the good job shall we  i called and scheduled a chimney cleaning and a dryer vent cleaning for my house i have owned almost  years  i know nothing about chimneys and have no idea the last time my dryer vent was cleaned  i got a discount over the phone when i scheduled both  awesome money savedso here was a huge perk they did a saturday appointment at a good time  lady on the phone was nice  our guy called me about  minutes before my appointment said he was running early and asked if it was cool that he showed up early  what was good is he said i know this is earlier than your scheduled time so if it is too early dont worry about it  however all i was doing was watching reruns of the simpsons upstairs and was home so i green light him coming over early i believe my technician was named mike  nice guy did not walk on my lawn had a beard that would have made chuck norris proud  here is where this guy and this company sold me  i scheduled a dryer vent cleaning with my chimney cleaning  mike walked to the dryer vent outside of the house saw that my dryer was directly next to the wall and told me it was not necessary to clean that as it is against the wall and explained why  guy actually told me and showed me how i can clean it myself basically just reach up against the vent and pull it out only need to pay for it if the dryer is not against an exterior wall and explained why  seriously this guy could have just hooked up a shopvac to to it and did nothing and lied to me that he was doing something and surfed the net on his cell phone and i would have bought it  he didnt treat me as an idiot and did not rip me off  saved me  bucks or so  thank you and well donewhen he got to work on the chimney told him i bought this place about  tears ago never looked at or used the chimney  this guy had to move my couch and coffee table out of the way to get busy on it and i mean get busy  treated my furniture like his own  he had something around the chimney that collected any debris that fell out of it a big blanket or something  this guy really gave a damn about my house  after the cleaning was done actually took a few minutes and showed me how the chimney worked how to maintain it when they are not around and how to keep smoke from coming into the house  this guy really educated me on it  even gave me a quick follow up quiz on it and gave me a second demonstration on itso the second perk this guy did a number on the dirt and debris inside the chimney  he pimp slapped all the dirt soot and all the other ungodly things that have built up inside of it  if you have ever seen the show its always sunny in philadelphia mike was pepperjack and my chimney was his best ho  google it  bottom line this company could have ripped me off with a dryer cleaning  they did not and explained why and did not charge me for it  they went to work on my chimney and owned it  found my company  congratulations you now have a customer for life  take a bow and give mike a pat on the back  will use this company every year|very nice aaa office in the safeway shopping center i never noticed it before and its huge when

across mint indian bistro my suggestion is try it once for lunch buffet and dinner all you will find is consistency in taste quality and customer service yes there are multiple choices and this is about  mins away from the strip but with ample parking and great food its worth trying we are glad that we stopped by this placeps gets super busy so call  hr in advance|so it is not common for me to write reviews on establishments that i have attended but the experience i had at casa di amore was so exceptional i couldnt help but to spread the word this place is a must for anyone and everyone in vegas this restaurant has managed to hit all the hallmarks of a classic italian american eatery the staff was amazingly accommodating the food was outstanding the vibe is that of old vegas with pictures of retro casinos adorning the walls and the music made me think i was listening to frank sanatra himself starting with the staff you can tell they truly care about the place they work and that customers have an enjoyable experience next i had a couple different appetizers they were all good but the star of the show was a fresh baguette topped with fresh mozzarella and prosciutto just wow this establishment can handle tables of  seamlessly and the owner michael made sure to stop by every table to ensure we had a great experience as a result i will now be going to this restaurant every time i come to town also i found out they offer a limo service that will take you out there conveniently which is a huge plus i made sure to take a stack of business cards and hand them out to anyone who wanted a one of a kind experience again i cant begin to bolster how great this place is|this is one of the better mom and pop restaurants in town  i really like the food the customer service and the atmosphere  i used to come here all the time  i eat here much less frequently since i moved to a different part of town  the orange chicken they serve here is very unique  its just like eating a fillet  this is a very traditional style restaurant  i would prefer this place over panda express any day if the week|great local sports bar with excellent friendly staff steel darts

shoes clothes to hair productsmakeup i usually come to shop for shoes they have a fantastic selection of heels work shoes and boots during the fall i always find nine west and jessica simpson heels for  or less they also have great designer ties for men michael kors and calvin klein just to name a few for  or less i know this only from getting gifts for male coworkers im sure nordstrom rack also has a great variety of button ups suits dress shoes and morethe service is always incredibly friendly the workers are quick to answer any questions you have and the cashiers always wear a smile when checking out its located in henderson on stephanie between sunset and warm springs its a bit of a hike from where i live but well worth the drive for all the great buys|thanks to pam for bringing my botched bob from the day before back to this centurywas very patient and accommodating in getting my haircut right very happy with my experience will definitely return|i love this place its pretty hip and its got a really good vibe the drinks are so yum and the whip cream is so good they are a little stingy on the whip cream but make sure that you ask for some if you dont you will regret it also i

was great plenty left over and we had no room for desert the hot tea was perfect for a cold evening|we had a pretty good size spread garlic prawns  not sure what all the hype is but not going to order again they were just okay eat the shells and theyll get stuck in your teeth combination fried rice  good worth buying again this was probably the only thing that wasnt deep fried crispy duck panang  worth  stars it stole the show now this baby was definitely worth buying again and again i should have placed an order of this to go i didnt see it on the menu but luckily i was able to pull up another review photo it was delicious  drunken noodles  if i cant remember the meat in it does that tell you anything this is why i went in the st place noodles were stuck together may order one more time to see if it was just the cook chicken pad thai  flavor was good but noodles were smaller than most thai places i have visited stuffed chicken wings  omg i could have eaten  of these as a meal my jaw dropped when i saw bill and realize we paid  for  but i think i will actually order this baby again fried bananas and ice cream  actually it didnt come together they charged us separately for it come on now all in all we spent  total with  beers and  wine glad we went sampling but now i know what i will and will not order next timesuggest making reservations we had about  people ahead of us standing in line before it opened they have some funky hours lady said it would be an hour wait but it was less than  mins glad we waited|epic burgers if you want burger luxury this is the place i consider myself an apprentice of all things meat and thus have been educated further by the wagyu beef burger covered in a red wine shallot reduction sauce i consumed i did also take notice of lamb and buffalo burgers on the menu along with your standard meat fair and grass fed options available i will be back god willing for thosefries and assortment of standard toppings such as avocado and somewhat less standard such as truffles and foie gras are also available the only meat better then this comes straight off the bull come hungry|ive seen penn and teller a few different occasions but they never cease to amaze me they do not have shows every night of the week nor are they guaranteed to have a single show each week this is because one show grosses enough revenue that they arent hurting for more money last night my boss treated us to some pretty decent seats as an early christmas present i avoided the bar area because beers were going for  a piece however this isnt a review of the bar so i will leave that part out of my rating i arrived a bit early and had about  minutes of fun enjoying a smooth jazz pianist mike jones play his heart out as we were entertained by the music audience members that wanted to be a part of the act signed an envelope on stagei did not but this certainly did not prevent me or anyone else from accidentally being a volunteer during the act we never had an issue hearing penn or other guests from the speakers their microphones worked beautifully the stage presence and comfortably penn and teller have with each other is truly phenomenal but this is no surprise when you consider theyve spent  years work with each otherlet me summarize some of the great tricks you might see cold readings in the form of jokes things disappearing card tricks ladies cut in half rabbit pulled out of a hat  you know the usual and likely ending the night with a bangif you feel like i gave anything away go to the show and youll see that my spoilers are quite small after the show if you are a serious fan you will have the chance to take a picture with these legends i would have if i wasnt so darn hungry|amazing unlike any mexican ive had before stopped in for a quick lunch in caesars and was amazed by the variety of the menu my partner had the tuna tartare nachos and i had the spicy chicken and sweet potato hash with poached eggs and green chile hollandaise both were delicious beautifully plated and arrived quickly was impressed enough to splurge on dessert and took the servers recommendation for the deconstructed banana cream pie obviously tequilas and margaritas are a specialty but its worth noting that the beer and whiskey selections available are obviously well curated to go with the restaurants flavor profile and high quality|this is the best food we have had in vegas the tuna nachos were nice chunks of tuna in a great sauce one of the dishes was mahi mahi cooked to perfection the lamb chops were fabulous there is real attention to detail the house made ice cream came in a ravol dish an expensive french bakeware line i wanted to take it home deanna our server was terrific she is really invested in wanting us to have a perfect experience she explained the menus in detail and also informed us on how bobby flay looks over the restaurant he is involved in all details  it shows no more encore restaurants run to mesa|always delicious always a classic pros food is delicious decently sized portions fun areas to sit in trivial pursuit cards at the table no problems getting seated on weekdays casual ambience room for lots of people my group once was a little inconsideratewe had  people that kept getting bigger once we were seated but the manager really helped us out reminding us to reserve for more people if we needed to i completely understand if youre going to have a big group call ahead and make a reservation cons cash only crowded on weekend mornings until  or  duringafter finals week parents weekends and days of sports events all usually on weekends|ive never had a bad experience there are two wonderful girls here who are usually our servers and they are absolutely amazing always so nice and

our waitress linda was awesome on the venetian one|ive been coming to this place not as often since my schedule is jacked up for over a decade and i cant say enough great things about it its a henderson cheers where everybody knows your name  or at least your face  and you can hang out and have a beer or enjoy the wine tastings on thursdaydespite being a smaller place the prices are amazing and the owners issa and nura will do special orders for you if theres a wine you simply must have but cant find anywhere  so im jumping on the much love bandwagon this is the best place ever|beautiful resortbeautiful view from our room fantastic service great resort to spend our christmas holiday|we had a dinner buffet it was really good being a indian i am always comparing to real indian meal i liked it to my taste i would recommend it to everyone|i usually eat at mon ami gabi when i am vegas this time we were staying at the paris so it was  even easier but its an expensive place and not necessarily convenient as everyday food the cafe is easy and fast its really like a french cafe feel i guess you get different a different waiter all the time and your experience will vary i love the croque madame its a french hot sandwich made of soft bread cheese and ham that alone is the croque monsieur topped it with a sunny side up egg and its called croque madame i tried it twice and really loved it i am french and i am always very skeptical to eat so called french food the croc as we call it is very soft i like the bread used not your usual toast bread its thicker and very soft if you know croque madame you need to try this one i also had napoleon which we called mille feuilles its a bit different cream inside usually its made of custard and not whip cream  it was not too sweet so i liked it the chocolate mousse was really good in conclusion we enjoyed our food got twice good service like the convenient location closest place to eat when you stay at the hotel you are outside whatever the weather is|we stepped into noodles for dinner couple of days back they had a long line for tables but were ready to seat us at the counter not a great seat location but definitely worth it if youre hungry we ordered sesame balls malaysian style roti prata for first course and they were delicious for the main course we had penang style noodlesveggie version with tofu and veggie fried rice we loved both the service was slow but that might have been because the restaurant was packed our waitress pauline i think was great  super friendly and kept checking on us frequently overall the experience was great and the food was amazing will come back again|always good food and service get the potatoes for breakfast with your order theyre the best|i had been wanting to try this place for a while and finally stopped in today for christmas eve lunch soooo happy i did i ordered the catfish which came with grilled veggie kabobs and the most delicious rice with slivered almonds and raisins the service was excellent fast and friendly the food was fresh well seasoned and the portions were generous i ended on a sweet note with the baklava the layers of phyllo dough were flaky and it wasnt overly sweet which is a good thing a lot of times it can be soggy and super sweet this wasnt it was perfect i cant wait to go back|it was our first time here service was great food was fantastic atmosphere is relaxing my hubby and i enjoyed it|christmas eve dinner i wasnt in the christmas spirit and stephanie changed that hands down best service ive ever had that says a lot ive traveled ive been in the industry for  years as a female in male dominated establishments you made my day stephanie great food warm informative service i watched the floor great teamwork both back and front i grew up in chicago going here and this is the best one ive been to|excellent  we went during happy hour and had the appetizers that were just filling enough i had the bacon seafood chowder lots of potatoes and lobster and corn creamy base both lois and i then had the crispy fried shrimp with red chili sauce on the side it had a bit of a kick to it so a little goes a long way but the shrimp had a light tempura batter fry and it was tasty without any sauce we toasted with a glass of prosecco the deserts looked lovely but we were full  dinner wise a little too pricey but for a light early dinner the appetizers make for a nice meal|beautiful room we got the balcony  bedroom stunning accommodation free valet parking great view best value for dollar we have ever spent on a hotel|it has been years since i set foot at olive  ivy mainly because i had been distracted by lifes other attractions  a friend reintroduced me to o  i this past weekend and i couldnt believe how much i had been missing out  its just an authentic large but quaint space  from inside to the outdoor patio all you can see is happiness and tastiness  we were a rather surprising large group of chatty women but mark our patient waiter served us graciously  olive  ivy go there for a happy time|this is a terrific place but since i live way in the wilds of the far nw of vegas i cant get here as often as id like which is probably a good thing considering that every single time i stop there my budget takes a serious hit  cheeses and wines that you cannot find anywhere else somehow end up going home with methe specialty cheeses and meats are a little on the pricey side but what youd expect certainly not ridiculous and the wines are very well priced  so its hard to know where to put them as far as prices are concerned  i would say overall very reasonable especially when youre contemplating say that rare cheese made by monks in the alps of switzerland who only allow it to be shipped once a decade yeah that may be a slight exaggeration but that gives you an idea of the quality of cheeses that they offer|first timer the family dog greeted me as i entered the shopgot some cave aged cheese crackers fig ham and a great bottle of frank family zinfandelby the way a tout for this whine for the holidaysa little more pricey than other zins but well worth itvery nice owners and knowledgeable service the cheese is gruyere and it is awesomemerry christmas|best oyster bar in town hands down been going here for over  years the only downfall is the wait so i always plan around busy times but it is open  hrs  everything on menu is awesome and you cannot go wrong|this place definitely lives up to the hype and is well worth the wait lines at night are usually a  hour wait but if you go at around  theres no line pan roast soooo good not too creamy and rich like other places which is good theyre not skimpy on toppings either and everything is so big shrimp and crawfish i prefer getting it with linguini instead of rice because i feel the rice makes it too porridgey the spice level is from  and if youre into spicy i suggest getting an  because i almost cried eating it but it was still really good oysters so darn fresh and juicy you see the chef cut them fresh open right in front of your eyes half a dozen for  best oysters ive ever hadoyster bar is a definite must when visiting vegas although the wait might be long i promise you its well worth after eating this places like ritters doesnt compare|best service of my lifei kid you not i left nove feeling like the freakin queen of the universe their waiters managers receptionist everyone there is absolutely pleasant nice funny and incredibly accommodating the venue gorgeous wonderful view the food amazing ok so i know this is an italian place but i actually ended up ordering a steakand this ended up being the best steak ive ever had yes better than any actual steak houses ive gone to the appetizers and desserts that our group ordered ended up being equally as good there are days that i have to talk myself out of driving the  hours it would take me to get to vegas when im craving this bomb food considers driving over there once this review is posted|celebrated my sis in laws birthday here and we had a very good experience i had been craving for laksa and this place serve them so we thought of giving them a try iam very pleased to have tried this place their laksa is very good comparable to those i have had in singapore we also got some stir fry noodles and they were awesome in short this place has good food and good ambience i secretly asked ginatheir staff that day if i can buy a dessert and have them put a candle on top of it for my sister in law and she said she would do it for free awesome shes very sweet the dessert we got was a sorbet topped with fruits and it was the bomb they even sang happy birthday to my sister in law if ever im in vegas again im definitely coming back|omg  mac king is wonderful  an amazing magician get front row seats and you will still be totally baffled and hilarious comedian  and relatively family safe some silly slight sexual references but they are pretty innocuous for the young who wont udnerstandimo mac is one of the must see acts in vegas and you can get discount tickets if you look at harrahs   great show  great talent|this place has the best thai food in las vegas we always order the garlic pepper chicken papaya salad and the shrimp fried rice the garlic pepper chicken isnt that garlic or pepper it has chicken placed on top of a broccoli bed its very tasty it has lots of flavors the papaya salad is great we get a spice level of   and its a great level for me the shrimp fried rice is one of my favorites it has great taste in the cookery and has lots of veggies and shrimp this place was great in general  stars all the way|fabulous dinner at tonight with my man lobster dinner and he had the lamb chops it was unreal and our server was fantastic will definitely come back here what a great evening|this place is awesome brings back memories when i was a kid and is so much fun|located mandalay bayhappy hour  every day from  pm to  pm yummyok this place has it all well almost the husband and i decided to treat ourselves to a nice little dinner we were super happy to know that this place also has happy hour so we showed up for that  i ordered their white sangria unfortunately i should have maybe ordered some wine the sangria was not tasty because it was soooo sweet not my type of drink but maybe others would like it i would say skip the sangria and stick to wine or beer we ordered the smoked hummus for appetizers that hummus was good you had the nice smokey taste in it without being overwhelming the pita bread was tasty too and warm as for dinner we were hoping to get their prefixed dinner but unfortunately we found out after seating down for dinner that they no longer had it we were started with their well known complimentary duck fat fries that are served with different dipping sauces i love fries so no matter what i knew they would be good we also ordered the yellow tail sashimi super duper fresh served with a bit of cucumber slices and some crispy rice and a little hint of chili best yellow tail ive ever had i would have been one happy girl with two more orders of this all for myself and im not one to choose fish over beef   for main dish we ordered oz of mishima reserved wagyu rib eye this is the first time ive ever had wagyu and it for sure set the standards high the meat was cooked to perfected and to order way juicy and oh so very tender  we ended our dinner with the beignets these are so not the disneyland beignets we know but holy crap are they bomb that macallan  butterscotch sauce i want to swim in it that sauce that sauce that sauce i am not even a btuterscotch person so i am glad i gave it a shot with an open mind because i was blown away highly recommenedwhen they give you the check they give you a little bag of popcorn on the house nice little extra touch great place for a date make sure to call to make reservations|i had the famous grilled chicken salad and it was one of the best salads ive ever had in my life the wait staff was attentive and the cocktail i picked long island ice tea was strong and well mixed if youre trying to decide between the white chocolate brownie and the apple pie go with the brownie both are good but the brownie is great|good food at a reasonable price and great servicemade reservation thru open table and was immediately seatedservice was impeccablegnocchi was one of the best ive hadhighly recommended|just going back in my memory bank as my good friend calls it  recollecting on a good experience at the red rock hotel its located a bit outskirt from the strip perfect for me as im one of those rare peoples who likes to go to vegas to chill not to be hype lol i love this one stop shop you can do everything at this one location especially for you gamblers though im not condoning it i did see a lot of people playing on site of this locationfood was okay i believe there is a few restaurant options on site i love the outside patio warm fire pits under the star lit sky spa my massage left me speechless its been years and ive had plenty massages after still my most favorite massage was at the red rock the masseuse was attentive and applied the right amount of pressure superb communication didnt chat my ear off nor was she awkwardly silent thank god lastly the rooms were sized perfectly spacious living room comfy bed pretty much what is expected of vegas however i must say since they have the land they are able to make every room even the ordinary rooms feel like king suites i highly recommend making this hotel and resort an option for your next vegas stay|i love this place this is my favorite farmers market in the area i go here almost every saturday to get produce there are tons of great small farms here and they will happily tell you all about what they grow and how they grow it they love what they do they care about the community and most of the farms are organic and nongmo at lot of the farms grow heirloom varieties of produce that you wont find in a supermarket my goto places abby lee farmstomatoes community exchange table crooked sky farms and golo farms youll also find soap candles delicious baked goods paella pet treats and local honey here as well as local food trucks that are as knowledgeable about the ingredients in the food they make as the farmers are  its well worth the minute drive from my house|everybody already knows that the food at sprouts is always fresh and very healthy well most of it is healthytoday the employees at sprouts went the extra mile to make sure that we got what we wanted what we thought we had ordered online was not what we actually ordered we thought we had ordered a fully cooked prime rib but we had actually ordered one that was not cooked one of the employees from the deli area found us a precooked prime rib and now all we have to do is thaw it heat it and eat itwe had at least three employees helping us and we left with a very satisfied feeling that the employees were actually concerned about our situation and wanted to fix itgreat job sprouts|i just saw spectre at the amc dinein theatres esplanade and was blown awaybesides being a thrilling

built also i had visited the south rim several times when i was young and wanted to experience something new driving from vegas i was so happy to find it would only take about  hours to get there vs about  hours to drive out to the south rimyou have to park your car and then go into a huge white tent structure which also houses their gift shop to buy your ticketsprices probably change depending on what time of year you go we went on  and here was the price breakdownhualapai legacy  entry feehualapai legacy  skywalk addon legacy gold  entryskywalkmealhualapai vip  includes all of the legacy gold but with your own tour guide native american gift and riding in a private vehicle that accommodates up to  peoplekids get a discounted ticket about  less than adultwe got  hualapai legacy tix and  kids tix with the skywalk addons and it cost us about was it worth it omg totally worth it we all loved itthere are  stops and you can stay as long as you want at each stop all  places have eateries that will make hot foods and i thought the selection and taste were pretty decent its american style food and its simple for us it was better to buy snacks or a meal to share vs getting the package that included a meal for all of us as our kids and i dont eat very much and a full meal is a lot for one of us to finish hualapai ranch there are old western style games and it is set up as an old western town my son rode the mechanical bull and loved it so much he wanted to go on again i read you can take a wagonstagecoach ride here or go horseback riding but that area seemed to be under construction when we were there ive read you could even stay overnight in the cabins there these are all things we skipped on to head over to the skywalk sooner rather than later as we had gotten there close to pm dont forget arizona is  hr ahead in the winter eagle point this is where the skywalk was there were native american performances taking place outside the skywalk even if you didnt do the skywalk the view of the canyon here was spectacular no rails so be careful of course we were there for the skywalk and i definitely was not disappointed it was definitely an experience i wont forget you have to put your pursebagcameraphones in a locker before you go on but thats fine with me the people there will take multiple pics of your group as you go through the skywalk you have the option to purchase them at the end we ended up with about  pics that we opted to purchase digital copies of and that cost about  it gets emailed to you i read how other peoples reviews about how this is a tourist trap but i gotta say hey what isnt nowadays also if the money we spent goes to helping the hualapai tribe especially educating their children then im happy to spend it i cant say the money i spend at disneyland goes towards any lofty goal and you end up spending way more there costs about  for a family of  just to get in there guano point the highpoint hike is there and i have to say that this really was the highpoint of our trip i dont even think words can express how beautiful it was there the moon even made an appearance for us instead of words i will use a panoramic pic i took there this was truly one of those places where you can say that a picture is worth a thousand wordslast thing i want to add to address all the people calling this a public park you make yourself appear to be ignorant and uninformed this area is not a public park you are entering reservation land when you come here it is private and they didnt have to open it to the public in this way also keep in mind that you have a choice of not coming here they are not making you pay for anything|my wife and i went in to have some wings and fries let me say our waitress taylor was absolutely amazing

pacific areathe first time we ate here the tom yum soup was really good but not as sour as my wife and i usually like we took the advice of previous reviewers and asked her to make it more sour the second time aroundboom it was perfect the penang curry was on point as the mixtures of flavors marry together in a hearty harmony as a matter of fact every other dish we had fried rice thai tea and the pad thai also brought about a similar reaction another key thing here is that the food not only had flavor but were also cooked or presented just right none of that commercial oversweetened stuff you find at other places service is excellent and the owner here is a very sweet pleasant ladythe  minute trek is across the valley is well worth it highly recommend anything other is your lossbut|best gyro ive had they should put one in scottsdale so i wouldnt have to drive so far|wow  great food great service  a little cramped inside but who cares those giving less than  stars are crazy and most likely are part of the pittsburgh crowd that prefers cheese whiz over actual cheese on their food|christmas eve having soup salad and a nice bottle of wine  top it off with two fabulous desserts and our server greg was amazing lets not forget the espresso which is such a european  tradition and i will definitely be back|if you think youve had a sandwich you are wrong prior to going to this place you have not had a sandwich you have only had meat with bread and toppings here you will receive a true sandwich with bread freshly made and toasted in store the holiday turkey should be on your must eat list should you ever find yourself here on the holidays it tastes like thanksgiving on a sandwich while the idea of cranberry sauce on a sandwich may not sound appealing to some rest assured they do not use ordinary cranberries and the quality shows the sandwich ingredients crunch well which highlights their freshness|ok so the five stars deserves some explainingthe bread is very good the tomato soup is a must try its new on the menu and amazing i ranked it five stars just for the soup the cesar is also delicious our server phillip was very friendly and helped us get out the door quickly which was our goal they were even kind enough to split our ravioli order which we were sharing on to two plates|ive already reviewed andreolis before but today demands a follow up the wife and i arrived at  on christmas eve as the team at andreolis were featuring an outdoor fish market we started with the grilled calamari while giovanni prepared the next part of our order on his outdoor grill setup for the days festivities he made us swordfish halibut and shrimp using a brush made of sage and rosemary dipped in olive oil to coat the fish meanwhile his kitchen was making us a portion of smelt lightly breaded and fried perfectly the fish is flown in special from around the world just for this event and it shows in how fresh everything is they really go out of there way to find the bestfor dessert we had an espresso and a cornetto and then just lounged in the bliss of a perfect meal until one of his sons sat down next to us with a piece of grilled john dory it was the sample from his plate that forced me to order my own this fish is also known as san pietro i dont know that i could have had this anywhere else in america today  it was perfectothe original idea was to come back before closing for dinner but things were so nice we just hung out on the patio for the rest of the day by  it was time for a cappuccino and a sfogliatella and then at  the pice de rsistance a giant dish of mussels and clams in a pinot grigio with fresh ground pepper and garlic  wow not able to leave good enough alone we were presented with a small portion of lobster in a tomato sauce that would make any gourmet buckle at the knee worthier connoisseurs would cry at   minutes after they closed we finally find ourselves in the parking lot armed with half a dozen chocolate and lemon custard beignets we can honestly say this six and a half hour gastronomical extravaganza is one of the greatest christmas eve celebrations my wife and i have ever experienced|great service

encountered i did not catch her name but we went at am when everyone decided to show up and everyone was swift and very nice i am very happy with the service and product |this is the best steak house in vegas for sure if not the entire west coast the service was hands down amazing from being greeted to the knowledge that the servers knew about the food not too often can you have a five star steak and learn about it in the process the prices are obviously high but its the only time i have left a restaurant while having just paid  for a dinner for  and said that was totally worth it we started with the beef cheek ravioli dont ask just order it and eat it the chef prepared it split without us even having to ask and at no extra fee i got the standard rib eye which was perfectly cooked while my wife got the riserva ny strip let me tell you that the riserva is nothing else like you will ever taste anywhere it was absolutely astounding if you are looking for a steak on the strip and money isnt an option you cant beat carnevino i know that we will be going back here whenever we are in vegas|so famous daves has been sitting in my backyard literally a stones throw away and no one cared to tell me why it was so famous  well luckily my outoftown friends took me along for a pickup run cause they were dumbfounded that i had no cluesmh vehemently  while waiting for our allamerican order i couldnt help gawking at the lipsmacking fingerlicking happily chewing satisfied carnivores i soon became one of them once we got home and got down to devouring ribs chicken and links the table was quiet for the first few minutes  at some point someone had to check in to make sure that everyone was okay  the food was devastatingly delicious from cornbread to coleslaw  now that ive shared this breaking news with you go and make your mouth happy|two words moqueca mista  i salivate thinking about this dish and crave it every time im in vegas  its a plate full of seafood in a coconut  lobster

mother of fucking god lets get shitfaced tonight after such an amazing breakfast on christmas eve this is honestly the best restaurant ive ever been to all those positive references are so right we arrived at pm for breakfast we were  people and waited not even  minuted until we got seated in an amazing place in the back of the restaurant i was totally overhelmed of how awesome this place is there were many people in there the food looks nice and so does it taste and the portions are huge and not overpriced the toilet is the most fancy one ive ever seen you have to move your ass in there or you will regret it if you cant take a coffee and get some free refills first i have no idea how my meal was called the card is only in french but a surprise is a good thing sometimes  and i was not disappointed  that thing was like a whole family dinner on a cut in half whole bread  and the mokka was really good as well  before tip for mokka and that complete breakfast fruits with real maple sirup as a free appetizer makes everything perfect just go in there you have to only the waiter didnt show up often but hes excused as there were so many people and all the other waiters looked friendly and were really busy as well so yeah go there|definitely a goto if looking for an intimate restaurant that has a different cultural feelits located on plateaumontroyal and apart from the location what first attracted us to going to this restaurant was that it was a bring your own wineor beer its a very small restaurant often crowded i would assume reservations can be made in advance my partner and i were lucky enough to be able to be seated without reservation as there was only one table left when we arrived the waitresses who served us is the best hostess ive ever had in my entire life amazing service experience and food for a table hte soupsalad main course dessert teacaf|the service is just amazinglove these people and the foodthis is not  star food as a general statement but for the price it sure deserves this statusmy wife and i frequent this place we love the waiters the rare mistake is fixed with apologies for  my wife and i have  courses with taxes included tip   suggested well deservedsee you guys soon|my grandfather took my dad when he was a kid and now he takes us he tells us that this place hasnt ever changed and i agree the walls are filled with magazine articles and pictures and the stools at the counter look pretty much the same theres only one thing that people  order the special a salami and bologna sandwich with mustard yes you have to take the mustard theres even a sign saying that you can order one of their fountain sodas and get a side of pickles this place has a crazy charm to it the waiters are very friendly and the food is always very quick and tasty this place is definitely a montreal classic|if only i had this in knoxville if you havent checked this place out then its definitely worth it i think a big reason for such a wonderful visit was because of our waiter we decided as a family agreement even if the food wasnt good sara r would have made it better do you know service affects the taste of food i have to say it does make sure you request her if you get the chance my family was be craving for sushi and well since it was christmas eve and i was in town the decision was made plus sushi in knoxville didnt really stir well with me so yama it was i did salivate over some pictures my parents sent me the week before walking inside the decor was modern it definitely represented the type of food that they served i mean not going to brag about the bathroom but they had a plant in there what japanese restaurant would have that anyways to the food we ordered  orders of uni  sashimi boats which comes with an assortment of  pieces were on that low carb diet and an order of fatty tuna oh and a large and house sake all that for about  that filled all four of us up and it was quite delicious added with the amazing service so will i ever be back as long as sara is our waiter im sure this will probably be my default place for sushi whenever im back in townedit i forgot to add that their sushi is fresh flown in from ny this dwarfs any other sushi restaurant around town however there are several other i believe that flies their sushi in but come here so you can taste the deliciousness|loved the lavo  it was a beautifully appointed restaurant with a relaxing atmosphere  the full menu offered food that would suit most anyones taste  i opted for the  day dry aged bonein rib eye steak which was cooked

only gripe is thats is expensive and portions are small im the kind of person that if im eating an appetizer and an entree i will likely take some home to go here i eat everything and i maybe hungry still the menu is has juices and other health foods perfect place for health nuts or those who want a nutritious meal  unfortunately this place does attract hipster douchebags and people who like to show off their moneyoverall its a well made restaurant|i love this charity shop the staff and volunteers are super friendly and helpful they have a huge stock room upstairs so its worth asking if

fried rice and i always steal some of his because its so good ive had the lau lau special days only which was excellent i like the standard portuguese sausage eggs and rice and their sausage is really good the only thing i havent been super impressed with is their saimin it was ok but nothing super spectacular last night they had friend saimin on special and it was the best fried saimin ive ever had their poke is also good i like the furikake style second their portions are huge i mean we have a friend who can eat a lot of food and even he had to take half his mixed plate home we always have more than two meals when we order their mixed plates seriously its like a pot of rice when you upgrade to the fried rice  third the people here are always super nice coming here really does feel like

i havent been where its not packed but its worth the wait my favoritesss are the brie  apples with fig spread and prosciutto with figs  mascarpone i get them all the time the last time i went there was a seasonal with butternut squash and pinenuts with a ricotta spread pretty sure thats it and i really liked it the smoked salmon and pesto artichoke only warm one and fresh mozzarella with tomato  basil are all solid choices too as far as other items i havent tried anything i havent liked but if i dont go for the board or if im sharing with a friend id usually opt for the mixed green salad add chicken or the turkey panini the servers are also really great they are attentive but not over bearing i have never felt rushed even though i know many more people are hoping wed get up from our seats cozy quaint atmosphere great service though not phone service wine and board nights love love|oh wow well its a small place usually a small  never full but fun crowd vocal talent is insane singing

chairs are in separate rooms so its great to go w a friend and have a little privacy|yes the meal will be expensive but the quality of the food will be exceptional our group of four tried most of the menu except the rolls but the dishes that wowed me the most were the appetizers salads and the duck fried rice the sashimi was on point but i wish i had tried a roll instead as i might have left with a bit of an appetite their cocktails were also well made and when we dined we were well taken care of if youre looking for cheap sushi this is not it but you can definitely eat a delicious meal here i

while your car is in service|its quite embarrassing reading some of these pretentious reviews from my fellow yelpers the main ingredient is what arizona needs in terms of downtown establishments that

breakfast place you should check out|excellent service wes could not have been nicer several months ago i stopped in with one of my cars without an appointment even though they were busy they worked on my car for nearly an hour attempting to determine the problem they concluded it was a warranty issue and i should take it to the dealer no charge who does that they said they didnt fix anything so

able to get in and out before the workers have a chance to ask if i need help  today the day before christmas i went in for a limited edition bra found what i needed and waited in the checkout line  the store was quite busy and somewhat crowded  an employee found me when i was in line to make sure i knew of the fastest check out options  i asked her a couple questions about my bra just to make sure i had the right one then she helped me complete the purchase at her mobile check out station  im not sure if the girls make commission here but i hope this girl got it because she really paid attention to the customers and seemed to go out of her way just to check in with meall in all  stars  my review is long overdue  this location has the best customer service out of all the stores i have ever been to az nv ca  sometimes the chandler mall location has more styles and size options but i almost always go to the tempe marketplace location first because of their employees  all the

working here|im over yrs old and have had my share of mechanics gary from garys auto is the most honest mechanic ive ever known he goes above  beyond to assist  you and will honestly take care of your

coffee water and danish i wish they had allowed for more time to enjoy coffee but i am fortunate and got my husbands cup he hates the stuff it would be nice if only one person from your group had to wait in line for check in you could rotate and enjoy coffee and snack or bathroom break without being rushed mind you there several busses all waiting i guess for now thats the best way to keep track of folks they played movies on the bus so it was a great way to pass time there were several stops for breaks and lunch with several buses stopping and so many folks descending on the place at once  minutes longer for lunch would be nice not much time to potty or enjoy your meal when the majority of your time is in line but i understand they are doing their best the folks at the restaurant were ready honestly at the second stop at the canyon we had dinner it was great if you dont care for mcdonalds i would recommend this although even with as many folks rushed in they were also ready to roll

to fakin bacon on pizza but no worries here this bacon was the real mccoy smoked and delicious on top of all the melted cheese according to my folks the ham was pretty good too we ended up leaving one

dealership i was advised a wait time of  about  hours for all repairs to be done initially the previous appointment there was new concern in the vehicle i brought to coltons attention and he quickly added it to the the repair list he offered a ride to home or work so i would not be tied up but i planned to wait anyways through the day and do all my phone calls and other business while waiting i also had him give me quote for a new tire of which i was surprised the price is not that far off from regular tire dealers the repair was done in almost  hours which was expected because of the new concern i am just glad that everything was taken care of even i would recommend this dealership insofar my experience with them is concerned|without a doubt one of the best breakfasts ive ever had a

looked into distance from from gcu things to do in the surrounding area amenities etc  we usually stay at embassy suites and i found this a cost effective alternative with similar amenitiesupon checkin we were greeted by very friendly front desk personnel  the check in process went fast  at the most  min  we came in late so it was nice to be on our way and to our room as fast as possiblethe room was smaller than im used to and there was no separate living space  however it did have a slider with a balcony to sit out on to enjoy a nice fall evening breeze  the bathroom was a nice size  i love that they have a dispenser for shampoo condtioner and body wash  i have allergies and am quite scent sensitive  the toiletries had a clean fresh scent that didnt bother me at all  the water pressure was excellent i appreciate thatoh by the way our room was right next to the freeway and we didnt hear any cars go by  im guessing they have major insulation to drown it out its a little further out from gcu than i had anticipated but it was a  min drive no biggie  we were busy visiting family so we didnt get to check out anything in the nearby area  i call up a gokart place that was a few minutes away  if you plan to do this check groupon they had a deal for it toohubby and college kids were comfortably crashed out on the beds  however i was so uncomfortable that i actually slept on the floor  it doesnt away from our great experience here thoughwe missed the managers reception so i cant speak on it but we did make breakfast and it was a nice hot meal  waffle house was just down the street but i think the drury inn breakfast is much better  they have a buffet style breakfast with make our own pancakes  i didnt try the pool  not a swimmer but it looked invitingcheck out was a breeze  id definitely choose this place over many other higher end hotels in the phx area  why would i pay an exorbitant amount of money for a couple nights in phx at a fancy hotel when i can pay half the cost and get the same and some times way better quality of attention and care  just sayin|jodi lynn is amazing you will love the experience and your final product|what an awesome find

customer service and frankly most of these patients sound rude theres only one review that questions an injectable procedure and it sounds like it was quickly resolved such few negative reviews on injectables is actually extremely rare for med spas they do great work at  drops and they really go above and beyond to give excellent service just look at all of marilyns replies to these reviews or

sometimes i am able to get in and out before the workers have a chance to ask if i need help  today the day before christmas i went in for a limited edition bra found what i needed and waited in the checkout line  the store was quite busy and somewhat crowded  an employee found me when i was in line to make sure i knew of the fastest check out options  i asked her a couple questions about my bra just to make sure i had the right one then she helped me complete the purchase at her mobile check out station  im not sure if the girls make commission here but i hope this girl got it because she really paid attention to the customers and seemed to go out of her way just to check in with meall in all  stars  my review is long overdue  this location has the best customer service out of all the stores i have ever been to az nv ca  sometimes the chandler mall location has more styles and size options but i almost always go to the tempe marketplace location first because of their employees

i needed some parts replaced so i went to a local shop to get a quote and they said it would be  then i went to goodyear and they quoted me  next i went to a super cheap looking shopwhich had a guy who couldnt speak english and the back seat of a van being used as the seats for the waiting area who quoted me on a sticky note  honestly i would be scared to get work done at that place but goodyear is a name everyone knows so you automatically have at least some assurance going thereso because of all of the above goodyear is already the best place but heres the kicker they let you bring in your own parts i thought for sure only small shops would let you do that but nope this goodyear does too that will further reduce the cost all the way down to  for parts and labor so if i went to the first local small shop like most people tell you to do i would have ended up paying an extra  just goes to show that people dont know what theyre talking about the staff was professional knowledgeable and friendly there was a large waiting area with plenty of room to sit and a large tv to watch this goodyear location is awesome and i will be going here until i move|when i was a kid my dad was a baggage

tour of the place every time you go there and all i can say is that its informative and educational and tasty you can taste every single item on the shelves my favorite oils besides those that are just oil are the tuscan herb and the butter flavors theres no actual butter by the way all of the flavored oils are infused with herbs which make some of the flavors amazing in that you cant figure

without hesitation management seems on top of it and double check that your servicefood is great never had an empty glass steaks are outstanding unlike chain restaurants the meat seems high quality and very well cooked top sirloin was my favorite and had the tenderness of a filet with great taste i begged for the recipe of the beer butter they put in it good amount of options not just steaks and menu is well organized did i forget to mention that the steaks were great i would go here over the kegnow to the cons while this place is impressive heres a few side notes atmosphere feels cheap while yes youre there for the food i think some warmer colors will make it more comfortable  may need a flashlight to see menus i have good eyes but family members reached for their phones  this is arizona so i cant expect the best and most fresh seafood like the meats but crab was a wee bit fishy fresh usually doesnt have any of that taste to it  for a table of  took a lengthy amount of time to get the main entree however i would wait twice that for the good tasting food on crowded nights gets a bit noisyso over all i will be returning here and making it my new choice steakhouse im very curious how the filets are since the sirloin was as tender as a filet from the keg texas roadhouse doesnt stand a chance too salty and the price point makes it better than higher end steakhouses  star and ill

another driver alex that was a true pleasure to work with alex was kind knowledgeable and was willing to to whatever it took to get the job done without nikkis personal dedication to ensuring that my

two years  i appreciate how they take the time to explain where the food comes from and how they use their home made recipes  the beef noodle soup is excellent  i am told they boil the broth for hours and use applesfruits to add flavour rather than msg  if you go on the weekend they serve this delicious custard pancake  use the paper bag when eating the pancakes as it can get quite messy|our family

found this place on my way to lunch at panda express  as i was eating my delicious greasy bowl of fried rice i made a promise to myself to come back later that day and take a pure barre class  and im happy to say thats exactly what i did and it was a great decisionif you have never done barre before like myself prepare yourself for full body soreness every muscle in my body ached for the next three days even though i consider myself a moderately fit person  barre class will find all those little muscles that dont usually get worked out and push you to use all of them  i always track my heart rate by using a chest strap whenever i work out in order to collect data on how intensely my body is working or not  i didnt expect much from the small movement barre philosophy but im happy to say that my heart rate and calories burned were on par with a rigorous spin class  all in all i loved my experience here and cant wait to go back next time im in the area|hello serious helpers alicia

professional and kind  this hotel is also doing great work for the community and for that they should be highly commended|i am a huge fan of group workouts and i saw that this place was offering a free two week trial so i decided to check it out  i think the trial is great offer that most fitness facilities should incorporate  its really impossible to tell if you like a place after one workout but two weeks is definitely enough time to get a feel if a place is right for you   i went by the facility before my first class and spoke with mark who explained the background of f class descriptions and equipment   in the past two weeks i have taken the following classes flamingo athletica firestorm and romans  besides romans the other two were more cardio based hiit or tabata type workouts  there are stations set up and the instructor demonstrates each exercise before a short warm up and then it starts  it moves pretty quickly and before you know it its over besides saturday classes which are  minutes the rest are   the classes i took were taught by mark eve and jenna and they are all great instructors and the class overall is a very highfive encouraging atmosphere the instructors are also great at addressing form and pushing you to do a heavier weight or modify accordingly whatever your fitness level might be  workouts that i took consisted of sleds dumbbells bars rowing machine bike sandbags and bodyweight  we really never did the same thing twice there are also monitors showing the exercise corresponding to each station definitely check this place out if you

in on  unfortunately due to traffic we drive  minutes to this side of town we got here rather late and had to call in at pm instead of dining in we explained the situation to the front desk who called patricia who was unfortunately not in at this time and verified our story to her it really says something about a company who goes the extra mile not only to write an apology letter about unpleasant service but also give your next meal on the house despite having to take out our meal was still warm once we got all the way to chandler again and was absolutely beautiful in flavor and quality while we were originally disappointed in what must have been a bad night for our server this night and the owners respect and consideration really blew me away we are definitely going to be visiting many

and she nailed my wifes personality and style with ease she showed me some beautiful pieces and i really liked this one ring it was  over my intended budget but the wife deserved it and peggys customer service and effort to really get to know the situation it really was the perfect ring so i bought it peggy wrapped it up for me and off i went and still got my chick fila sandwich it is a

liked that beltmann donated to me any used moving boxes they had handy recycling boxes and saving me more money instead of me buying new boxes the only issue that came up was that my delivery was scheduled for a saturday no delivery no call i didnt have the drivers phone number so i called the main number but they were closed for the weekend once i got a hold of someone on monday i was given the drivers number i learned the smaller truck they put my belongings on was in the garage waiting for a back ordered part i received calls everyday from the oregon delivery team updating me about the

two cats shelly and momo momo is definitely the more chill one in the household requiring little to no maintenance but my poor shelly is anxious about almost everything it seems poor thing stressed out so much that she developed a urinary tract infection we moved to the area about a year ago and really hadnt researched any animal clinics until her emergency uti unfortunately when i did a google search for veterinary clinics in the midst of my worrying az ave animal clinic was one of the first to pop up and im so happy that it did upon calling to schedule an urgent apt the receptionist was very friendly and i could hear the care and concern in her voice when i told her about shelly she was able to squeeze me in with dr sarah who is such a wonderful vet she was patient knowledgeable and caring towards shelly even if shelly did growl at her quite a bit in fear dr sarah took the time to really listen to what was wrong what her symptoms were abnormal behaviors etc it was such a relief to have someone like that taking care of our admittedly high maintenance cat what really gave this place a th star was the fact that dr sarah told me to call her with any problems or questions in the next couple of days she went beyond the standard call and care and extended her kindness beyond the initial visit i highly recommend her thanks to this place shelly is  back to normal they knew exactly what to do and i felt very included and important in all of the decisions not like just another customer|this is a great little bar in scottsdale  the wife and i went here for a yelp event and i am really glad we did  this is type of bar i would love to meet coworkers at for happy hour the atmosphere is fun and festive while keeping to its laid back roots  being christmas season the whole bar was covered in tacky lights which is fun in my opinion  they have the right number of tvs in all the right spots if you wanted to catch your sports team playing  the major win for this place is the lack of happy hour pricing  normally this is a big negative strike but this place has great prices all day every day  coach house is just a nice friendly neighborhood bar with an amazing atmosphere  this is certainly my type of place|love the pizza here always get the pineapple and pepperoni pizza all ways fresh and good quality|superior office staff friendly and accommodating dr hull

through with their dog the staffs time attention and helpfulness is unparalleled in comparison to any major chainfor me the reason why i choose tempe feed and tack is because every time i bring my dogs in the staff will not only remember their names but they remember which tricks they know and they always have treats at the readytempe feed and tack is just outstanding|i cannot believe how lucky tempe is to have such a friendly knowledgeable store with such a variety of jewelry  i have found the most unique pieces of jewelry there  they make lots of their own jewelry in addition to beautiful

dollars and not on the level of luxury i experienced during my stay found this gem of a hotel in fremont street a block off the fremont street canopy at the time i booked it was priced at  dollar a night with no resort fee it could even be lower depending on the time of the year you visit when i got there my room was not ready so they upgraded me to their suite cabana suite which is a another building across the street i think the room is well appointed clean and modern the bath is also very clean and looked freshly renovated but the lime green wall paint is an absolute disaster unless you are making green screen porno in your hotel room in that case youll love the convenience the staff are very friendly much nicer than the ones on the stripe on strip if you are not a whale you are no body out in a smaller casino they actually enjoy costumer service its a very local feeling the kind of las vegas you remembered from the old days cheap drinks cheap food no frills i stayed there for like a week also once you get used to downtown las vegas the cost of living is much more reasonable than the strip so you save on other travel expenses as well the bus stop is also on the end of line of the deuce bus whys that a bonus you ask because you can be sure to get a seat downside is that the suites are not in the same building as the casino its not much of a view and far from the strip action also the walk home from the bus stop in the wee hours can feel kinda sketchy because you are officially off the tourist path for a few minutes on foot but totally worth it if you in vegas on a budget would stay there again if the price is right|i was in vegas from out of town for my wedding and i was worried about not knowing any local barbers but mike jones took care of me lined me up and

to eat the sushi was fresh the hand rolls were amazing everything was off the hook just as good as los angeles food i felt so spoiled because of the prices were about  bucks for a lunch buffet the

we go to vegas because the sushi is so darn good we are from the bay area and eat sushi all the time and its great to have somewhere else to eat at thats not in the bay i would recommend the ramen and

then assisted me with ordering it online since they did not have my size in stock he was very professional and an absolute pleasure to work with as far as the store it was clean and modern and looked nice but i never shop at dillards since im not from vegas so i really cant comment on their merchandise but i wanted to give a shoutout for the excellent service i received from david g|i recently

with upgraded tequila i really enjoyed the salmon burger and duck fat fries the restaurant is awesome but they hide it in a strange way near the lobby dont be shy march on to the bar and order up its

noma jiro and liquorlicensed taco bell unlike some other luminaries i finally had a clear and easy shot at checking this off the list thanks to a friends decision to host his bachelor party in montreal quite unfortunately despite a couple months advance warning reservations were not to be had getting through to via phone joe beef is an ordeal in itself let alone speaking to someone in a rational manner in order to procure said reservation alasthe biggest hangup was our large party of  but our coordinator sold us and mr beefs purveyors on liverpool house joes younger larger sister restaurant so while joe beef remains bucketed i at least had a chance to sample the goods i apologize profusely for the lack of photographic evidence as liverpools hearty spread was enough to feed a small army and quite deliciously i might add i chalk it up to a full slate of day drinking prior and we were just lucky enough that the groomtobe made it through the evening a prix fixe dinner with something like  different courses and plates ended up coming to a very respectable price not inclusive of the mountains upon mountains of old fashioneds or something other whiskey cocktails that we ended up ordering that nightthe highlights are the meats obviously anything meat like joe beef liverpool houses menu is always chalkboarded such that the only menu i have is questionably stored in my noggin however i do remember the lobster spaghetti and its good to quote joe beef aficionado anthony bourdain damn good the red meat of which we received two kinds boneless and bonein were also

for this place first the food was great and the lunch special was cheap too definitely get the garlic knots but above the food i want to mention the service i saw more compassion in my twenty minuet lunch than i did the better part of this year the gentlemen that worked there was so friendly and a great server but more so just a kind person a man came in who was having trouble with his motor functions the man who worked there helped him walk over to his table returned the change to this patrons pocket when he couldnt and just went so far beyond what was required of his job that made my day more so than the food if you dont give this place a shot youre the one missing out in more ways than one|greatest thai food on this planet we call earth no really i have no more to say ps  get the

to schedule a meetingwhen we met she could tell that i rarely actively seek people outside of the online realm in part due to settling in to a career and having little time over the years to really find someone she worked with me one on one and when i was really ready to meet someone she began matching women with me all the while continuing to work with me directlyafter following her dating plan and her one on one coaching i have had some great romances and feeling much better about finding the right one  the women shes introduced me to are successful and stunning i really cant say enough

restaurant where the portions were so big you felt sick for eating so much but plates that were meant to be shared more than a tapas restaurant though there were a ton of great options we wanted to try like pork belly veal rabbit lamb and even octopus with so many options we all three decided to go with  courses of chefs choiceour waitress asked if we had allergies and what we liked none and everything i know it was probably super helpful haha i cant remember the proper terms for all of the dishes mostly because it wasnt directly on the menu but the first plate was almost like a donut ball with porchetta and other deliciousnessnext it was octopus on cooked plantains with i think pork belly third course was three different proteins mackerel veal cheeks and something else veal i know im being super helpful one had some bone marrow on top all of it was delicious thinking back to the second and third courses i really cant pick a favoriteeach course the chef came out and explained the dish very thoroughly on the last dish he told us that we were his guinea pigs on a hot to cold dessert dish he was trying warm sliced pears room temperature white chocolate what was baked and caramelized and fresh coconut ice cream it was really interesting what he was able to do with that white chocolateoverall if given the option to order off the menu or let the chef take you on his own

good|nobu is possibly my favorite restaurant in the entire universe ive been to three locations the one in malibu being the best because of its location overlooking the ocean the nobu at caesars palace however is a close second the ambiance is relaxing the lighting is dim without being too dark im always impressed with how quiet it is even when its really busy its refreshing to not have to yell across the table to have a conversation the food of course is to die for every dish is a work of art as a photographer and visual person i tend to eat with my eyes first i usually get the same thing each time but occasionally branch out and try something new if you cant decide what you want its always fun to let the chef choose for you just tell them the types of sushi you usually gravitate towards and they bring you a feast i recommend the white fish tiradito the sauce is tangy with a little bit of a kick also try the nobu crispy rice with big eye tuna the presentation is genius the crispy rice comes in little cubes that act as serving trays for the tuna the tuna is reminiscent of a mixture of ingredients you might find in a spicy tuna roll but of course the quality is totally amplified|they have a bar parking is easy its here or galaxy in henderson for me|clean spacious easy parking super friendly and accommodating service takes reservations food is amazing and portions are really generous i reserved a table for  and when we arrived they had placed the  salsas plus awesome bean dips to be shared between  people and kept on offering refills on their freshly made chips grilled onions and jalapenos were also provided while it did take a little time for the food to arrive we had fun enjoying the atmosphere and the kids liked watching them make fresh tortillas we of course ordered a flaming fajita plate which was impressive and delicious but the rest of us couldnt resist ordering from the happy hour menu which was impressively inexpensive and incredibly filling maybe partly because you can almost eat your entire dinner with the bean and salsa dips they also provide complimentary soup which is like a tomatobased soup with rice the kids loved it and we all left with togo boxes they do have tvs all around tuned into sports if thats something that youre into but a slight drawback since we had young kids and a couple of the tvs were showing a pretty graphic boxing match id definitely come here again and if we were locals wed probably be regulars|i had heard online and from others that this was the place to go for my classic car but ignored that advise and went somewhere else closer to my home after two days trying to get my  mustang aligned the other place gave up and also forgot to replace my camber bolt washer i took my car to garys the following day and was very pleased he test drove my car something the other place didnt do then he inspected it thoroughly and pointed out my missing washer as well as two other areas that needed repair on my car after i got the missing washer from the other shop to gary he was done within an hour and the car was set to the specs i requested and he charged less than other shops i will definitely use this place again|this is a great place for breakfast i had a turkey avacodo sandwich with delicious breakfast potatoes service is outstanding they take care of you a lot|i love chilly jillyz  any time i am home visiting my mom i always make it a point to eat here at least once  when im driving into town and remember chilly jillyz along the ride i cant wait for dinner haha  everything i have ever had here is really really tasty  i believe they bake all their breads themselves and they make their fries themselves too  its sooo good  normally i am not really a french fry person but believe me i will eat my fries from chilly jillyz  my favorite thing to order is the best dam panini with the tri tip it is put together so well ugh i want one now thinking about it while i write this  their sandwiches and burgers are a lot of food so you can share with somebody without leaving hungry  i have also had some of their salads when i am trying to behave myself and their salads are actually really good too but lets be real i want the panini   ive never had any of their coffee drinks or pastries but im sure theyre delicious  they also have a fro yo section and i see families come in just for that pretty often  all the girls that work here are really friendly toothe only thing that puts a slight damper on things is that they charge  cents for a little  tablespoon serving of their homemade ranch  their ranch is probably the best youll ever have which is why they can get away with that price gouging  i could understand if you ask for extra but your first ranch should just be a given  i know its just  cents but its also just  tablespoons  i always forget they do this too so when i ask for ranch when they bring our food its kind of annoying to dig into my purse for  cents before i eat  anyway i am so happy that boulder city has a great place like chilly jillyz to eat and im so glad the business is so successful  |i was rear ended in a car accident and

to be amazing when there is a line out the door once seated this place did not disappoint from start to finish the service was fast and the food was spectacular to start i got shoshito peppers and pork buns the pork buns were to die for so good i ordered another round the peppers were played with a sauce drizzled over them at first i wasnt thrilled about this but once i cleaned the plate off it was clear i loved the dish for the soup i ordered the shoyu ramen basic chicken broth with big noodles i kept mine basic and only added pork and medium boiled eggs very simple but very tasty i cant wait to come back and try more items|it is such a pleasure visiting a local business where the owners and staff are friendly knowledgeable and efficient with reasonable rates for their services  thank

but the star was the raised twist better than krispy kreme|i would recommend kerns plumbing to any home owners who have concerns on the quality of workmanship when it comes to installing propane gas tank and equipment  kerns just installed a  gallon underground propane tank in our backyard and hooked it up to our courtyard fire place backyard fire pit spa heater and great room fire place  all i can say is that we are so glad kerns plumbing is the one who completed those tasks for our new homeafter the installations are done jonathan came out and did a thorough checkup and provided detail explanations before we use any of the propaneconnected equipment  it took a long time to bleed out airs for the first time but jonathan did it very patiently without skipping any safety procedures  in fact he even came out the second time to bleed the air out at our courtyard fireplace because there was an ignition issue on the first visit  it wasnt his problem but he just squeezed time out of his busy schedule to come back again simply because he wanted to make sure all gas equipment works properly after his company installed itthis is the first time we use propane gas so we have tons of safety concerns and kerns addressed all of them  we always get our responses within  business days  this company is all about quality communication and responsibility  i thought i would have to contact a propane gas provider to get the best and safest propane gasrelated work done but apparently kerns plumbing proves otherwise as they have the right professionals and expertise in the propane gas field arguably better than any other gas provider in phoenix i called the other propane gas providers and most of them are clueless when it comes to technical details  kerns plumbing will always be my first choice if i ever need any propane or gas related project done down the road|this is my th time here in four weeks i try something new and everything ive tried have been winners plus theyre

experience here yesterday and i cant believe i didnt know about the combo deal between the two of us we shared an asian citrus salad minus the chicken an crab avocado melt minus the bacon lobster

avocado melt over the vegetarian but my bf loves the vegetarian the asian citrus salad was one of the better salads ive had recently it was one of the first to be finished the place was very customer friendly with a very nice lady even helping us out with customer favorites they have a spice rack for us spice is life crazies beware of daves radioactive hot saucei was impatient and didnt read the

all things hairand then i saw that they did permanent makeupimmediately set up an apt with tami to touch up my already existing eyeliner and spur of the moment decided on a thicker line just because i could awesome decision self my thin eyebrows were making me sad because they werent growing back fullerjust longer like the old man kind that are trying to reach out and touch you so i figured why not

love to have we came in for lunch so i got the combo of soup and grilled cheese i loved that the combo comes with a oz beer i thought the presentation of their french onion soup was great with two

exceptionally knowledgeable and extremely helpful i called him to inquire about his services to assist me with the software on an old cdma iphone and he went above and beyond to help me he could have just told me to bring it in and charged me but instead he guided me to the correct place and he didnt make a dime for that there are still honest businessman out there thanks dale|lemme tell ya something  grinders is freaking fantastic and exactly the kind of local entrepreneurial eatery that our city needs more of as boringcrappycorporate chain after chain invades las vegas  i drive past every one of those soulless merchants of prison food to chow down with the good people at grinders  this is authentic tasty and inexpensive food from some dudes that grew up in the philly area and know their stuff  and by the way if you are giving a star review to a place that averages  and  stars based on well over  reviews there is a very good chance that you are an idiot a hater or both  now on to some highlights yes the name of the place says pizza lounge and the pizza is very good although as with any pizza place its always best to order a fresh pie  they make a great slice personal size  than the slices sitting under the heat lamp but look closely at the first word in their name  grinders  what does that mean  that my friend is a sandwich like a sub that is heated in the oven and comes out toasted with melted cheese  mmm mmm good  i personally recommend the italian the pork with spinach sauted in garlic the meatball when available and of course the cheesesteak try it hoagie style with lettuce tomato  mayo  and to the genius who complained in his review that the sandwiches are  the same food connoisseur who suggests that you go to a corporate chain instead that is for a whole sandwich which is beyond mega and way too much food for most of us reasonablysized people  all you need in this world is a halfsandwich comes with fries and maybe a tasty little half salad beforehand  do the right thing here this place takes it craft beer seriously and is one of the few restaurants in this part of town which devotes  of their  tap handles to a changing array of craft beers from great breweries such as ninkasi alaskan founders joseph james and others  plus they usually have a couple of good craft beers in bottles in the back if you ask nicely  there may even be a secret underworld craft beer society growing here but i am sworn to secrecy the game day football specials here are outrageous  if i remember correctly we are talking about  personal pizzas eating a whole one will more than fill you up and  price draft beers  you dont even need to care about the football game thats on the tv just come in and have a great meal  a craft beer for cheap the folks who run grinders are a really great group  this is their business and they are totally immersed in it and will do anything to make sure their customers are happy  those couple of ridiculous bad reviews i especially like the one from the elite yelper who basically said that the service  all the food was very good except for the calamari but still gave them only  stars and complained that  was too much for the megafeast of large pizza wings calamari etc that they ordered  time to go back to chuckecheese cheapskate really do upset and affect them and they work tirelessly to make improvements though i suppose you cant please everyone  the sheer amount of regulars that i see in here is proof that if you come in a few times try a few different things on the menu and chat up some of the friendly staff there is a good chance that you will become a grinder yourselfpeace out and if you see me there maybe ill buy you a pint of craft beer|thank you dyson for your exceptional service i cant wait to upgrade my dyson vacuum in the interim i appreciate you fixing my current dyson vacuum  the issues incurred were likely attributed to user error i was in and out in less than  minutes|wow just attended an amazing cartel beer  food pairing dinner chef justin woodward blew it out of the park the dinner featured  beers from local craft brewery cartelthe shop that complemented the  course meal

into the store was smiling and glad to see us  the store itself was bright and cheery and had a great display of dog cookies and toys etc  the ladies amber and brenda came out to greet us and socialized with the dogs before they took them back into the grooming area  they asked us questions about the dogs and seemed to really care about what they were doing  when my mom and i came back later to pick them up we could hardly believe they were the same dogs  i hadnt had them groomed in a while due to the move and they were pretty gnarly looking  when we got them back they were soft brushed out and they smelled so good  amber and brenda really took their time with both dogs and gave us their good reports and tips on how to brush their teeth  i will definitely be taking bailey and muffin back there again am very grateful to these ladies for making our babies look their best|super yummy tacos homemade tortillas yummy asada and yummy rice not to forget they serve thrifty ice

favorites is the channa masala  this dish is made with garbonzo beans tomato potato onion and flavored with roasted cumin  i cannot get enough of this dish i would eat this every day  the channa is

hits first and then comes the sweet followed shortly by a little heat keith one of the owners acknowledged the sweetness and rightfully wouldnt disclose what it is the pulled meats arrived on beds of buttery grilled texas toast accompanied by cole slaw the meats stood on their own with definite hints of smoky flavor of the four proprietary sauces at the table i tried and liked keiths spicy whiskey sauce the best although i recommend trying all of them to find your favorite erin sp the other owner stopped by to ask about my meal and remembered me from before they switched i told her they are definitely doing something right by adding smoked meats to the menu my server chad was great attentive and would gladly ask for him again ill be back|we went crazy for cray cray she was amazing the

finally got around to going to chon after jib invited me to dine there we were greeted warmly upon arrival and offered a seat wherever we wanted we settled in a cozy little booth and started looking over the menuour waiter came over  suggested that we try out the chicken chon thai rolls while figuring out what we wanted for our meals they were delivered to us in a very short while and we dug in right away the rolls were super tasty not quite like any other spring roll ive ever had before the sweet  sour sauce was also really tasty  not too sweet like some sauces ive had at other places id recommend getting these to start off your meal i definitely want to try the crab delight next time toofor our main meals we got the crispy panang chicken curry and the chicken pumpkin currythe panang curry was really good it was served in a cup with rice vegetables  the crispy chicken on the side while i liked everything on the plate and thought it was absolutely delicious i missed the traditional way that panang curry is served with everything mixed in so id probably get the noncrispy chicken kind next time as far as the level of spice goes i ordered medium  thought it had quite a bit of heat but like i mentioned the sauce was absolutely delicious i mixed the rice in there  enjoyed awaythe chicken pumpkin curry was an absolute treat too neither me nor my boyfriend have had pumpkin curry before  we really enjoyed it it was thick  creamy and very flavorful with vegetables along with pieces of pumpkin in it super tasty wed definitely recommend trying it outas soon as we were almost done

wants to try this place out should come hungry that way you get to try all the cuts of meat|this place was amazing reminded me of the authentic szechuan that i can get from the chinatown at home i had been dreaming of that shredded potato dish and never thought i would be able to get it here in champaign if you are looking for standard chinese american fare you have to remember that szechuan is a lot more spicy and i love that about it when i ordered a tofu dish the server asked if it was ok that it had meat and i said of course so i think they are starting to learn how to be more vegetarian accessible they also asked if we had any questions about the menu where i am from the menus for szechuan wont be that descriptive and will not have pictures i appreciated that they took the time to explain what their dishes are i also like how they converted the decor of the place looking forward to trying more stuff on the menu i love that they brought some heat to this town|wow words cannot

various pieces has always been correcteven if it ended with me buying a less expensive item  her stock ranges from what id call inexpensive to what id call so ridiculously expensive it belongs in a museum  but you can discuss your budget and shell show you the things you can affordwe took a dear friend to her when he wanted to purchase an engagement ring  they established what he could afford

look to the north and see toys r us is packed as is olive garden and most everything else that way drive down neil turn onto main and all the restaurants in downtown are relatively empty  dublin big grove guidos destihl everything is relatively vacant i start to feel sad not for the empty restaurants but for the people who decided that it was worth it to eat at olive garden i felt genuinely sorry for people who thought that olive garden was a good decision we park and walk to farrens we go past more restaurants that have seats available miga that thai place and still im thinking friggin olive garden is fullwe go down the ramp into farrens i make eye contact with the server he points to a table no one else sees him point to the table i go and sit down they stand on the ramp and are like you cant just go sit down they have to seat you and im like do you know who i am a little while later i inform them that yes he did tell us to sit there we place our drink order theres triptych on tap so thats nice seems to be a recurring theme that triptych stuff is everywhere i order a beer on draft the lady orders a beer on draft the sister asks do you only have that craft stuff on draft she gets i think a coors light how can you drink mass produced beer with craft food kridz orders the mozzarella sticks i get the portabella mushroom appetizer the moz sticks are moz sticks nothing too fancy it seems about them the portabella mushroom is the entire cap cut in half breaded and fried served on a salad bed hell this thing is practically a meal to itself for the actual meal i order the russell you cant go wrong with sauted mushrooms bacon blue cheese sauce and pepperjack cheese bacon on everything at some point before the burgers came out we also ordered the mac and cheese if this is on the menu get it the ladies at the table were like what is this puddle on the top grease and im like uh thats butter then they are like who puts butter in their mac an cheese then go into a discussion of how they made their mac and cheese for holidays this this this butter this this seemingly forgetting that they put in a whole lot of butter butter makes everything better as does bacon mmm bacon butter i dive into my burger i also got fries with that fries are delicious but unnecessary after eating some of the mac and cheese and the whole mushroom cap i finish my burger i have blue cheese sauce throughout my mustache and beard thus is the struggle i deal with a drippy delicious burger all throughout the beard i have another beer everyone else finishes eating the ladies sit around and

things to know are that basically everything on the menu is good and that you will get a lot of food and drink for drinks  my boyfriend ordered the flight of beer and he had to reassure the waiter

excellent customer service  thank you|as i write this review i find myself overwhelmed with gratitude and feeling tremendously cared for and blessed if you are seeking a catholic church in the southwest look no further    my parents have been parishioners of this church for years and i will admit having been raised in a catholic school  church in the east coast for years as an adult i have fallen away from the church my parents kept urging me to go with them to just one mass and i never really had the desire to make an effort to attend    my enlightenment in my faith and belief  trust in this parish came about under the most unfortunate of circumstances my grandmother had grown much more frail and had to be cared for around the clock and my mother requested that a priest come to the house to deliver last rights to her within what could not have been more than  minutes father vic came to the house and and gave her this most sacred blessing within days she passed and the staff in particular nancy  ginny along with father vic organized such a beautiful funeral mass for my grandmother and our little family   shockingly  months later my father passed suddenly  days before christmas and when our funeral home director called to schedule the mass for us the church said they didnt have any availability until january nancy the parish director for all services remembered our family from my grandmothers services previously and were able to fit in a funeral mass for my father that friday pastor father john himself called my mother personally to give his condolences and prayed for my dad right over the phonethese gestures meant so much to us during what has been the most difficult time for my mother and i      when nancy and ginny met with my mother and i they remembered my dad and were in disbelief of his passing and remembered everything about us down to our dogs names they even extended invitations to join them and their families for christmas so we wouldnt have to worry about anything during this most difficult time       father vic gave my dads funeral mass and recalled details during his sermon from my  grandmothers services as well father john passed by the end of the funeral mass to extend his condolences to us personally     this entire experience has made me feel such a sense of community and belonging that i havent felt since i attended my parish in ny as a child not only do i have a renewed sense of faith but a second home here|after spending  days calling around to find a florist that would fit my needs for my wedding i came across naakiti with other florists i was leaving messages hearing some outrageous prices and having to choose either or from the moment i contacted naakiti i was impressed by the upbeat attitude

seen thus far while other florists simply wrote down numbers in an email naakiti specifically christina inserted pictures of what i was looking for had a very detailed account of what i wanted and had very reasonable prices also delivered on sunday i loved the flowers my bouquet was amazing great customer service definitely go with them if you need flowers for any occasion|always the best and

afternoonevening at the enchanting theatre  the nutcracker show was as professional as can be and i believe orpheum contributed to the engaging performance  the ambiance temperature lighting acoustics and general mannerisms of the staff and attendees were exquisite  the velvety seats were roomy to sit in except for the leg room for people to walk past  the ushers  usherettes usually called docents were polite and lookedacted like they truly like their jobs  there were refreshments and a cash bar but i brought my own water bottle so i wont review that part  i especially liked that they permitted us to walk around the inside of the building  floors   floors to explore and take shots inout and not block some areas off with that typical velvet rope  i felt i was walking around a mini mansion and not a business  they were not decorated for christmas except for the tree in the lobby  the powder room in the basement was clean  overall it just felt classy and welcoming in there including the box office where i picked up my will call ticket  thats just the thing about downtown phoenix after i attended their free public tour last spring i had hope that theyd have a christmas show for me to attended to experience a true performance and lo and behold when i saw that they were having the nutcracker show i quickly reserved my seat before it dared sell out  i love the balcony area which made me feel special and important  i happily support a small local theatre and will do so continually  orpheum please do not ever disappear or change your name how about i suggest you bring back the original cursive signage like the one los angeles still hasi bet the appeal of the orpheum influenced alot of the nostalgic feel among people there that day  folks were wellbehaved and dressed nicely  thanks orpheum and the nutcracker for all your entertainmentand no i didnt see a ghost  |i live in alaska and every time  i stop by arizona i get my hair done by ahreum she always knows exactly what i

some little things that i really appreciated like having tvs in the ceiling ive never seen that in a dentistdoctors office and i just cant imagine why its wonderful and makes going to the dentist a lot easier whats better than being stuck with your mouth open but being able to watch an episode of law  order you practically forget youre at the dentist i was exhausted when i went in for our am appointment but this early time did not affect the staff dr quinn made sure to ask specifically about how my experience was with customer service and he very much showed that customer service was of utmost importance to his practice this is refreshing in the medical world since a lot of doctors just assume their only job is medical work and who cares about customer servicedr quinn was also very thorough and treated my wife and i in a timely manner he gave me a list of things i needed done including my wisdom teeth internally i was a bit concerned about what the cost would be with my insurance but i didnt ask he told me someone would be with me in a second to go over the details and make an appointment to my surprise someone came in with a breakdown of the costs for everything i needed done and also showed me the price with my specific insurance this made it really easy to see what my cost would be for such a complicated procedure which made the choice easy to book with them

hotel made me feel like i was a damn queen our room was huge for two queen size beds and a living room area bathroom is ahmazinggggg wow if i could design my bathroom it would look like that the only downfalls to these hotel rooms was that our window faced a wall and the bathroom and shower doors did not have locks obviously if theres multiple beds then multiple people are staying there and there should be locks on doorsanother plus is downstairs there is a very convenient food court with lots of food i mean lots wow fast food and fine dining thank you also casino is very lively and nice would love to stay here again|this is what a steakhouse ought to be located in the venetianpalazzo complex its divided into several rooms all pleasantly decorated the ambience is relaxed and friendly the wait staff is attentive without being overbearing theres none of the pretense you get at say carnevino in the same hotel complex there is a nice energy level but you can easily hear each otherwe brought a wine bottle from home and the wait staff was fine with it they politely informed us of the corkage fee a reasonable  without making us feel weird about having brought our own bottle the way some places dowe started with a very tasty shrimp cocktail to share then i moved on to the piedmontese boneless strip steak which was delicious helen had the salmon which was like butter potatoes au gratin made a nice sideeverything was perfectly cooked impeccable in quality and served with refined flair|everything about this place was amazing  the food the service the ambiance it couldnt have been better  we began our meal with bbq shrimp bonein bacon and lobster bisque all of which were delicious  now on to the steaks we ordered bonein ribeyes and this was by far the best steak ive ever had it was perfectly prepared and the flavor was out of this world for our sides we ordered sauted mushrooms and grits both of which were equally delicious  we finished our meal with dessert and we ended up with two the pecan pie and the caramel butter cake both of which were you guessed it deliciouslets talk about the staff and the service  from the host that greeted us when we walked in to the gentleman that walked us to our seats to the three gentlemen that served us everything and everyone was absolutely delightful  the three gentlemen serving us were rene brian and david and they ran like a well oiled machine  they were very attentive and very pleasant people and they helped make our dining experience so wonderful the ambiance was perfect for our early xmas dinner  we had a table where we were able to comfortably eat dinner have a conversation without screaming at each other and we werent wedged between other people being forced to share our dining experience with strangers definitely a five star establishment with five star food and five star service we will definitely be back|we had pm dinner reservations and they were able to give us a table overlooking the bellagio

divine tender cooked to perfection the frites complemented the dish well good wine selection fabulous experience|lovely lovely lovelythere is nothing i can say that hasnt been said before but this place is devine a nice relatively affordable french steakhouse located facing the bellagio fountainsservice is great food is great come for brunch or dinner and sit on the patiotip you can not book a

i ordered the imported dover and we shared a side of fries and mushrooms  i think i tasted the best ribeye ever anywhere everything about this was amazing the service the food the drinks it was just amazing|fantastic place great service the suite overlooking the strip was amazing micheal jackson one show is a must|love love love this hotel yes its not really on the strip or if its considered that its far and the entrance to the parking is super confusing but overall my stay here was great its definitely a different vibe from the other hotels ive been too but my group and i got a huge suite with two door entrance at the end of the hallway came with a very large living area space with a gorgeous view the whole hotel room had huge open windows with a great view of the pyramid hotel next to us each room came with a flat screen tv and the bathroomsshowers were different but very nice beds were comfy and i hadnt had sleep the whole weekend until that moment and i woke up to the nicest view so relaxingonly thing i was feeling iffy about was the fact in one room our tv would not turn off no remote or button on the tv would turn it off so the whole night we slept through it the other downfall is downstairs its not as lively as other hotels and not really a large selection of food to eat from so a tip for you guys is to take their tram thats in the hotel to luxor or the hotel next to luxor and its free quick way to get closer to the strip also we took that tram for food as well as to get closer and walk across to mgm grand where we went for night clubbing awesome tram that my friend found that saved us a lot of time and money |yes yes yes i love olives i love todd english i loved everything maybe it was view maybe it was the food maybe it was the company but my party and i started out here before heading out into the night and it was the perfect way to begin our evening having eaten here before in the bahamas and loving it i knew this place would not disappoint olives is todd englishs take on modern italian favorites that focus on a more expansive mediterranean forte first off can we talk about the bread and tapenade holy olive oil batman oh my goodness is that stuff addicting i think we ordered  or more refills for my party of  i could have just snacked on that all nightbut i was indulging my whole mealfor apps i highly recommend the beef carpaccio gorgonzola polenta parmesan cipollini onions balsamic reduction scallion cream garlic aioli what a pretty dish to look at as well as eat i think it was on our table for no longer than  seconds until it was just an empty plate according to the server it was there most popular appetizer and i can see why get itfeeling pasta i ordered the ricotta ravioli for the win knowing it would please it was a generous helping topped with roasted tomato basil sauce sweet italian sausage and garlic bread crumbsdelicious the other menu item that caught my eye was the butternut squash tortellini which was made with brown butter amaretto cookies sage and parmesan cheese luckily my friend ordered it and i got to try some and man was that just as good but be forewarned it is a more sweet dominated dish in regards to flavor think sweet and savory like a sweet potato but nonetheless great todd english does it right from the service to the atmosphere to the all important food and olives is no exception come here for a great dinner|ok i get it it took a while but i totally get itnatt spil is to dog owners what a cat is wait what let me explain the number one complaint about cats theyre not dogs and theyre not supposed to be cats are their own creatures they do their own thing and they dont care what anyone else thinks they march to the beat of their own drum theyre cool without trying to be cool theyre masters of their domain and thats what natt spil is its so cool it really is its not trying to keep up with the joneses so what if it doesnt have  taps the beer they have is usually quite

bellagio in vegas  the atmosphere was sheer elegant and comfortable|we did a staff trip out to vegas which was my task to organize all the details from travel to meals to entertainment to lodging for  people by far the easiest thing to book was the blue man group jennifer oshiro and jace medsker assisted me in booking the group and had options for flexibility in tickets and set up our transportation from our casino communication was quick and polite always we researched quite a few shows to see and that definitely helped tip us toward seeing the blue man groupthey checked in with me prior and jennifer met our group for the transport walked us in explained the area handed us our tickets and met us again after the show as someone that manages a guest services department for an entertainment venue i truly appreciate the level of service they provided our group liked the show itself especially the interactive portions  icing on the cakeif you are a group id definitely reach out to jennifer|now the best buffet offering the carnival buffet plus the seafood buffet in the same location use to have each one separate ends of the rio hotel food was delicious and one of the managers by the name of sal treated our family like it was his own hes definitely an asset to the restaurantwill definitely return in the near future|my favorite go to buffet spot in las vegas even though the bachabal buffet in vegas is rated higher and number  i still prefer this one dont get me wrong the bachanal buffet in vegas is great but the extra food selections are just adequate to me i rather pay  less and wait  hrs less i wish i had a bigger appetite because i cant eat that much they have a unique diverse selection of foods from pho vietnamese noodle soup to gelato green tea ice cream here are my favorite food selections prime rib cold crab legs cold cocktail shrimp chicken wings gelato ice cream sauted clams and the mongolian or teppanyaki not sure which name is proper to use grill i wouldnt mind the m buffet because they have an small open bar recently the rio casino combined their regular buffet and seafood buffet into one location use to be seperate you can upgrade to the seafood buffet for  more personally i had the seafood buffet a few months ago for the first time before both locations were merged and was quite disappointed they didnt even have lobster tails or prime rib having both buffet built together make more sense to me|i typically hatebuffets the thought of other people getting food off of the table in front of me is not appealing the warm temperature of the food and the idea that it may have been sitting there a while also leaves me room to question the foods freshness but this buffet was great everything was fresh the tri tip was cooked perfectly they had prime rib and crab legs the french dishes tasted authentic and the desserts were just beautiful the fruits and salads were fresh and the soup was so rich and creamy they definitely pulled all the stops i will not visit another buffet in las vegas except for this one ive been to a few other ones that were supposed to be great that were only mediocre at best but this one was quite memorable seriously check this one out  its worth it|outstanding bbq but also an incredible beer selection  maybe the best ive ever seen|been going here since i was a kid always pleased

so chic and adorable upon walking in the manager sonny immediately offered us a drink and was so so kind they were slam packed and sonny kept checking up on us to make sure our experience was greatmy nail tech worked quick but did everything with precision my nails look amazing when the nail tech arrives they give you a straw since you cant really pick your glass up small things like this make their customer service above and beyond did i mention they play awesome music this is not your average nail salonim from out of town but if i am ever back and need a manicure this place is  in my list|had some drinks and food while catching some football games great service and food will definitely be back|low price and absolutely wonderful bahn mi  tucked away but definitely not a hidden

on priceline and got the clarendon and so glad that it was this hotel  not core downtown  but totally fantastic the front desk staff  justin and his colleagues were great the room was large with comfortable beds and pillows bathroom offered good quality shampoo soap but the most terrific is the  restaurant  its not a hotel restaurant  its a terrific dining experience decor service and menu are outstanding and we had perhaps one of the best breakfasts ever  many thanks jacob micheal and marshal  thats jacob in the picture and hes as outstandingly courteous and fun as can be|best seafood in vegas dont let the crappy hotel derail you the oyster bar is hands down the best its always busy so expect a wait really late night or early morning is the only time you wont find a line its worth the wait i always get the combo pan roast spicy level  extra rice heaven|i got the blue cheese peppercorn with chipotle mayo and an egg cooked medium lemme tell yall damn damn damn so damn good the burger was excellently seasoned  i mean excellent it came with fries  chose the cajun steak fries  again phenomenal  seasoned really well a for the foodcome get a burger here|what a time to be alive ah yea yea its always great but hey this mandalay bay buffet is a great bang for your buck i must say from the elegant entrance to the fact that they cook your steak the exact way you want it had to add that im a well done guy this is a great choice in comparison to the surrounding fine dining optionsmy wife and i came here for dinner which costs  we were greeted by an older man named lee who let us actually browse the buffet before purchasing the meal he was very clutch for that i might add being the fact we were kind of on the fence about paying  for just another buffet our server was a really sweet older lady named gloria and she was on her service in top fashion which is always greatly appreciated i think we all can agree onmy favorite food choices were the tamales  tamale lovers will dig  the sweet n sour chicken pizza steak fried rice and any of the chicken theres also solid dessert selection worth cheating with a little bit only few things that i have to say that i would like to see is maybe a burger  beef patty option along with hot bread  rolls because the breads are just in a plastic container at room temperature to get at your convenience all in all the bayside buffet is worth it especially since it kinda has the exact or remotely similar food here in relation to the surrounding fine dining options from the customer service to the atmosphere to the food quality you get is absolutely worth the money come check it outi hope this helps|mac king is hilarious the show was funny and amazing at the same time i couldnt figure out how he did any of his tricks especially the finale this show is definitely worth seeing there are usually people waiting outside of harrahs and handing out free tickets for the show all you have to do is buy a drink which is

very unique yet excellent example of a yuppie nature park  if youve read my other reviews yuppie nature parks are those where there are manicured and groomed wildlife areas that feature broad smooth largely flat trails that can easily be traversed by the elderly children or just about any would be hiker that wants to go for an adventure  all of the plants and animals are maintained by park rangers who eliminate anything that does not fit with the motif of the park dont get me wrong these places are usually extremely cool and beautiful  the riparian preserve in gilbert is no exception it has many excellent examples of local desert flora and fauna as well as several manmade ponds designed to attract migrating waterfowl and other more permanent resident birdsthere is a drought right now so most of the ponds are dried out but there are still a few out there which have many different interesting species of birds including wood ducks regular mallard ducks white herons hummingbirds and other creatures which can be identified by the signs that are posted all around the different ponds  there are also many helpful signs in front of different trees bushes and flowers so you know what you are looking atthere are also play areas for children including a few dinosaur footprint areas where little kids can have a great time discovering real dinosaur footprints in the cement  there is also a small planetarium where you can view things at night and learn about planets during the day  the local library is also a beautiful and fairly new structure with many excellent offerings for anyone with the time to investigateif you are in the area and looking for something unique to do outdoors and the weather is right be sure to visit this place  it is really special and worth your time|great bar great staff i continue to go here because of that the definition of a neighborhood bar|barriques is definitely my favorite coffee shop in town their coffee is awesome as are all of

quite a few mediterranean restaurants in town but this one ia definitely near the top of the list as a favorite everything ive had is so good fresh perfectly seasoned my favorites are the shirazi

that we have yet to shop at but is also pretty busy definitely recommend this place for lunch just arrive before noon |caf monarch is a beautiful little house that has been turned into a fantastic gem of a restaurant my husband and i came here for our anniversary and found it to be one of the best places we have ever eaten from the st course your implicit trust in the chef forms even if you dont

tacoma and a  runner for my fiancee chris was able to provide me up front competitive pricing even when they do not have to on these tacomas as they are selling faster than they can get them in other dealers were telling me that they would have to charge me msrp because there is no reason to discount the tacoma the guys at a toyota dealership up in north scottsdale tried to overcharge me and then offered me lowball numbers on my trade they treated me like i knew nothing but i had done my research while they may not have to discount these vehicles the guys at riverview understand what it means to invest in the customer treating the customer right and with honesty will pay off dividends in the future as i will certainly be back to see them whenever i need another vehicle in the future they know how to build and establish trust which is priceless the  tacoma is a very hard to find vehicle in the trd off road x and chris was able to get me exactly what i wanted with options and in the specific color i wanted from the factory on dealer allocation chris was very transparent with all of the numbers on the purchase both chris and tony were super knowledgeable on the toyota tacoma itself which is huge because how many times do you go to dealers and these guys dont even know all of the bells and whistles on their own product i did a lot of research before purchasing my tacoma so i knew all about the features and various configurations on the truck as well as the invoice costs chris was able to get me rock bottom pricing with no hassle as soon as i walked in the door their service department also provided a free shuttle service when i went back to get my windows tinted which was super convenient their financing department was the quickest and most efficient operation i have experienced in my car buying experience and i have purchased at least a half a dozen vehicles in the last  years they had me in and out in  minutes or less on the tacoma and in less than  minutes

are fantastic first burger ever i didnt put ketchup on nor did my husbandand he eats everything with ketchup fried pickles are the best i have ever had we like hooters pickles these are  better mostly because they are thicker and fried to perfection we are just driving through tonight but will visit charlotte again soon just for cowfish oh and fyi the area is really nice|the cowfish sushi burger bar is the coolest most innovative idea i would never have guessed that sushi and burgers would go well together but its perfect this location was very busy but my boyfriend and i were able to sit at the bar and still enjoy it took a while to get our food but we sipped on a beer and enjoyed the busy atmosphere i ordered a fusion bento box which comes with your choice of sushi sweet potato fries cucumber salad fresh edamame and a mini burger of the day everything was heavenly and you cant go wrong with your sushi choice the mini burger was a double burger topped with mushroom bacon and goat cheese yum my boyfriend ordered the mediterranean lamb burger and boy was it tasty the portion size was huge and the burger delightfully juicy it was topped with fried goat cheese and it all melted in your mouth ill have to say that the prices are a little high but the food is totally worth it if ever youre in the area for cowfish go go go you wont be disappointed|not the cleanest place but the food is legit carne asada is really good super thin and has a great smokey flavor try the aguas frescas  make sure theyre not the ones from the machines refried beans are good and the salsa are good too feels like a home cooked meal|amazing the bread is delish hard to find good bread in az the chicken salad hoagie i had was very good the second best i have had in phx and that is saying a lot the desserts are amazing i met a wonderfully nice customer while in line and we chatted like old friends can i tell you how much i love my new neighborhood  i can actually talk with my neighbors and not hide from themha the owner came out and joined in the conversation that was cool there is one lady who works behind the counter that is not very outgoing and seemed annoyed when people ordered things that seemed weird but i think that is just her way the other gal is very personable this is a great place to have a sandwich and some treats by the way their coffee is very good here too if you just want a good plain cup of joe|scott responded quickly to my email for a quote then called to set up a time and was able to take care of my drywall patch the next day he did it quickly the work was good and price was fair i would use him again|where do burgers like to dance at a meat ballwhere do i even begin with this place from the atmosphere to the appetizer to the meals themselves the experience was wonderful from the moment that we arrived at the restaurant we were very impressed with the atmosphere that it gave off being that the majority of the cosmopolitan is very dark and sleek looking there was a bit of juxtaposition that takes place with having a place like holsteins in there the lighting inside of the restaurant gives off a very warm and inviting vibe and theres all sorts of cool cowrelated artwork filling the inside of the restaurant its very funon a friday night we were seated immediately which kind of surprised me being that holsteins is in a very popular hotel on the strip and on a night where people are usually out and about i probably helped that we got there before the clubbing crowd hit though so theres that either way it was fast and i like that then as soon as we were seated we were brought our complimentary popcorn appetizer which i must say was quite the tasty start to our meal i actually had to make an effort to not fill up on the popcorn too much before the we got our actual burgersbefore we even got our burgers though i made sure to check in on yelp and boy am i glad that i did because we were able to snag a free beer through a promotion that they have going on with yelp wherein you get a free beer with your first checkin to the restaurant i didnt finish it because of how tasty and filling the burger and fries were but it was really nice i got a tiny bit of tude from the waiter when asking about the promotion but i can look past thatwhen we finally got our food which didnt take very long at all it looked so delicious that i had a hard time stopping to take some pictures of it to accompany my review i ordered the nom nom burger which consisted of kobe beef cheddar cheese potato chips and thousand island dressing and the empress miss joyce w ordered the urth burger a vegetarian burger consisting of a house made vegan patty with lettuce tomato cucumber sprouts and avocado as soon as i took a bite of my burger i knew instantly that it was without a doubt the best burger ive ever had i dont know if it was some sort of placebo effect caused by my knowing that the burger was made with kobe beef or that the burger was just plain delicious but man was it good the burger was cooked to a perfect medium and the cheese was melted evenly all over the burger and in a generous amount there was also a generous amount of potato chips on the burger which gave it such a nice crunch with every bite i dont think that i had a bite of that burger that didnt have a bit of potato chip in it the thousand island dressing on the burger was also delicious the entire burger was just so good right down to the bun with just one bite even the empress could taste the deliciousness even her own vegetarian burger was delicious which in itself is not something youd expect to eat at a place like holsteins where its all about the beefeven the fries and onion rings that we shared were awesomely done both of the sides were nice and thick and in yet again generous portions which i can really appreciate we couldnt even finish all of it because the burgers were so good and filling and there was just so much in generaloverall holsteins provided a  experience for us through and through i only wish wed had enough time to go back there to try more of their wonderful creations i know there wasnt one burger on that menu that i didnt want to try if ever you find yourself in vegas i would say to make a point to try out holsteins|dont expect life to serve you what you expect just enjoy the buffet  manoj vazdedicating my th review to a buffet  hardly  well actually it is what im doing but its mainly because i just got back from an amazingly memorable trip out to sin cityso wicked spoon  what can be said after  reviews  for starters im still full from saturdays dinner here at wicked spoon  i had eaten so much bone marrow sans crostini because im a fattie and dessert im surprised i didnt throw up  and this was before we hit the bar for some libations  matt c was the best dinner companion for wicked spoon because he seemed to enjoy his food as much as i did  i got to admit though that i thought there would be more variety  they had a carving station for pork shoulder and prime rib duck a lorange homemade italian sausage a fish cooking station a tiny selection of sushi a pasta station some pizza an impressive salad bar an even more impressive dessert bar et cetera  they even had crab legs  yet i still wanted more variety  lifeasafattie  dinner was pp and it was definitely busy  i was disappointed that they were out of pork belly but having some mac  cheese made the disappointment a little betterall in all i wouldnt mind stopping in again  decor is nice service was speedy and the food was hot  take me back to vegas please|who doesnt enjoy a nice cup of joe  press coffee is one my my favorites when i want to enjoy some good coffee  you cant beat this location either  if youre walking around scottsdale quarter its easy to walk right in and get yourself a nice cup of joe  staff is always friendly and the atmosphere is warming  they have enough tables for you to sit around on your laptop too if you feel like getting some work done  if youre not into coffee they also make an excellent cup of hot chocolate|i like to shop at this dollar tree location they always have alot of deals especially for christmas which helped me out this year because of the christmas cards and candy i needed to buy they also always have what im looking for at this specific dollar tree location and the customer service is always top notch and the people are friendly and make you seem like your important overall this is my favorite dollar tree location out of the many out here in vegas|fantastic and made from scratch  so good  i ordered two slices but wish i ordered more lol|i love secret pizza its a little slice of heaven and of home i can say this is the best new york style pizza ive had in vegas yet and its relatively cheap to boot  for cheese upstairs from marquee its a great end of the night snack im not sure if they close or not but they were open at am and this is vegas so who knows nom nom nom|having missed this place during my last visit my mind was incepted with the idea of coming here later in the nightfast forward to am and my buddies and i are waiting in line for our post party meal of cheese meats and grease tucked next to jaleo on the nd floor of the cosmo its really not that hard to find unless i guess if you are super drunk but there was a pretty decent line for this secret pizza place reminds me of the lines at the jumbo slice places back here in dc after a night of partying but no one really minded the wait with the main prizes on their mind and taste budsthe pizza itself i thought it was great i mean i blinked and it was gone maybe it was the fact that i was starving and had a few drinks but i remember it having a distinct taste nice and soft not too soft or floppy freshly baked dough and crusts and a good helping of toppings on each slice i got two slices one white pizza with cheese and ricotta cheese and a second slice with mushroom and pepperoni and they sure did the job  prices were standard for vegas  a slice i think all in all secret pizza lived up to my hype i would definitely come back here when i am back in the area and recommend it to any pizza lover especially for later in the night|great place to hang out with friends awesome coffee creative sandwiches and all day happy hour best  mimosas anywhere|update  changed from  to  star travis and company went above and beyond to

i can honestly say i would use this company again and recommend them to everyone so very disappointed  tuesday before christmas expecting many guestsjob unfinished by affordable flooring paid in my opinionway too much for one room of carpet but thought because of the time issue it would be worth it extremely poor communication and as stated job unfinished workers said they would be back by pm

shopsbreakfast cafes and this was by far the most friendliest place you wouldnt think a place located in corporate park would be so friendly and comfortable but it was the owner pulled a chair from our table sat down and began to chat with us he wanted to know where we were from what brought us to charlotte and all about our coffeebreakfast habits it was really refreshing to see an owner of a coffee shop so engaged in his costumers involved in the kitchen and outgoing i thought that was really classyim not only coming back because the owner was so nice but the food was really good too plus it was super cheap i ordered their low fat yogurt granola  berry parfaitmy roommate and i split their ham and cheese croissant it was melt in your mouth heavenly i also ordered a latte on the side and

decided to mix things up and get the corn beef hash which turned out to be a mediocre meal remember to upgrade your meal to get the speciality pancakes for about  is totally worth it dont forget to upgrade to garlic rice if your meal doesnt include adobo fried rice they have a great selection of specialty made pancakes but known for their red velvet pancakes im a big chocolate fan so ill try to

girlfriend since her back was bad but she recommended me to jay i was clearly going in on the wrong days some people are really intimidated by male chiropractors specifically muscley ones but jay is amazing and gentle if needed ive heard people diss the joint saying that its a joke among chiropractors and that really pisses me off i went to a great chiropractor for a long time that had the big fancy name and machines etc and they worked for a little but i kept getting the same adjustment and treatments each time it felt like instead of helping me they were hurting me with the joint i have had great service each time jay in particular is really great about checking you out before he adjusts he feels the complaint area and really gets and understanding of what needs to be done kevin is the owner and most of the time you will see him out front he has other people out front dont get me wrong but how often do you get to interact directly with the owner  when i first met him he learned my name and remembered it ever since dont know about you but i appreciate that ive recommended a number of friends and family and will continue to do so i really love this place and how they learn about you and take care of you go see jay|you probably wont find a better gluten free patisserie they do croissants eclairs you name it all gluten free and many milk free as well the breads are pretty

long time ago i sing their praises constantly my favorite sandwich is the malibu hot pastrami on garlic cheese bread are you kidding me as if that wasnt good enough it also has avocado i mean seriously  this is my dream sandwich the boyfriend likes the surfin cow or pig or the santa cruz but hes always conflicted about trying a new sandwich the main problem being that there are too many

can be a little rough if its a busy night for one of the other restaurants in the center so be mindful of that|wonderful restaurant  the service was awesome the waitresses were extremely friendly

the newish palazzo locationwe decided on the large in pizza with chicken sausage and mushrooms then ordered a carafe of their house red wine for  the wine was not very good on its own but will likely pair nicely with the pizzawhen it arrived the pizza looked really tasty and couldnt wait to take a bite i was in pizza heaven with the first taste the crust was thin and some what chewy then the sweet and somewhat spicy sauce was added to the crust in mindful clusters no haphazard slopping on of sauce here the yummy mozzarella was applied in a similar manner lastly the chicken sausage added a delicious meaty and spicy fennel notei was right the marginal carafe wine really paired nicely with the pie by bringing out the spicy fennel and cutting through the cheesy mozzarellagrimaldis i must confess your pizza in my humble opinion is easily the best in las vegas possibly my favorite of all time cant wait for my next visit to pizza nirvana|if you love a good thin crusted ny style pizza you

the prices are not bad this is becoming one of my goto places in vegas|the school of rock is a magical place where budding musicians grow wings the feeling of rock and roll pervades the space yet the

free customer and eating japanese is extremely difficult the server went completely above and beyond to offer me options and he double checked everything to make sure it was safe often as a gluten free person you feel like a nuisance to servers because some people feel like its just a fad diet they offered to take my gluten free soy sauce and prepare my food in the back they gave me full portions and a great presentation its wonderful to know that even you can be accommodated even in a place with almost everything containing soy sauce our chef wasnt super personable but our server made up for it i will definitely return to this restaurant and encourage others to try it note building sign says kabuto not what is listed on yelp|avec deux amies nous sommes alles nous faire tatouer

this company a five star rating  i just recently arrived in arizona and was a little  unsure of the business ethics of the companies i would be dealing with here  although i got off to a rocky start i have to say i would have no qualms about dealing with bullfrog again  the owner turned out to be a stand up guy and a man of his word  i have to disagree with some of the prior ratings and say that the customer service i was given by clay i believe the owner or manager was more than fair and the five star rating is more than deserved|this is a great place friendly staff and clean environment the

killing time so wandered into buckle i was immediately complimented on my harley jacket by an employee i gave her a thumbs up and continued to mosey around she then came up to me her name was hunter and asked what i was shopping for im one of those kinds of people who doesnt like being approached by sales people in stores so i told her i wasnt shopping just killing time a minute later she came up to me with a pair of jeans and said she thought id look good in them and i should try them on at this point i figured i would just humor her and do it because i didnt want to be a jerk and say no normally i would be annoyed at this point but somehow she was persistent and friendly at the same time so for some reason i was willing to go along with iti ended up trying them on and amazingly they were a perfect fit so much that so that they are literally the most comfortable pair of jeans i have ever tried on in my life if i had had my way nobody would have talked to me i would have browsed for ten minutes and then left in my crappy illfitting jeans instead hunter somehow broke through my crabbiness and now i have probably the best pair of jeans i have ever owned and they were only  too which is pretty good for decent jeansi thanked her she gave me a fist bump its all good|petit coup de coeur pour ce caf  jadore lendroit qui semble tout petit vu de lextrieur mais rvle une salle bien

and were seated pretty quickly  bill took care of us and was super friendly  turns out he was manager that evening  he gave us options for specials and we got a couple glasses of really tasty wine i got a pinot and she got a riesling they had run out of the sweet potato au gratin side dish her and i both wanted and although they clearly made a good effort to find substitutions we gladly chose to get side salads instead the dressing for those had this smokey bacon vinaigrette dressing that was perhaps the best dressing ive ever had no joke  main dish was the roasted chicken and carrots that really tasted perfect my date and i continued great conversation after our food was done and bill surprised us by bringing complimentary hot toddys which were also amazing we continued to talk sitting by that fireplace sipping our drinks but what we didnt realize until later was that nobody else was there but us and they were technically closed  he never asked us to leave or anything but instead brought us drinks for free  a|i love these guys i have never had a problem with them at all they always try to be helpful and are friendly i have had issues with other gun shops standing behind what
