excellent food superb customer service i miss the mario machines they used to have but its still a great place steeped in tradition|mr hoagie is an institution walking in it does seem like a throwback to  years ago old fashioned menu board booths out of the s and a large selection of food their speciality is the italian hoagie and it is voted the best in the area year after year i usually order the burger while the patties are obviously cooked from frozen all of the other ingredients are very fresh overall its a good alternative to subway which is down the road|yes this place is a little out dated and not opened on the weekend but other than that the staff is always pleasant and fast to make your order which is always spot on fresh veggies on their hoggies and other food they also have daily specials and ice cream which is really good i had a banana split they piled the toppings on they win pennysaver awards ever years i see why|all the food is great here but the best thing they have is their wings their wings are simply fantastic  the wet cajun are by the best  most popular  i also like the seasoned salt wings  wing night is monday  wednesday night  whole wingsthe dining area is nice very family friendly the bar is very nice is well  this place is truly a yinzers dream  pittsburgh dad would love this place nat|cold cheap beer good bar food good service looking for a great pittsburgh style fish sandwich this is the place to go the breading is light fish is more than plentiful and a good side of home cut fries good grilled chicken salads or steak  soup of day is homemade and lots of specials great place for lunch or bar snacks and beer|i highly recommend this place the mechanics are really honest and im usually in and out with no issues|i visited this store several months ago to simply ask about smartphone plans the agent was pleasant and helpful i would recommend a visit to this store|i am a big believer in first impressions so when i go to a new business i pay close attention to how they treat me and how they run their business joe was very polite and friendly as soon as i met him as was his shop assistant i needed a cv joint installed as well as a new transmission mount joe was nice enough to estimate a fair price to install both he honored that price was fast very friendly and treated me like he knew me for years its a great neighborhood shop and joe is a real nice guy who could have easily raked me over the coals but he didnt i know quite a bit about cars and everything he told me was true hes earned my repeat business immediately give him a call youll be glad you did thanks joe|before i finally made it over to this range i heard the same thing from most people  its just fine to go work on your swing i had such a low expectation i was pleasantly surprised its a fairly big range  if you are familiar with scallys in moon it seems like it has almost as many tees though its not nearly as nice a facility the guys in the pro shop were two of the friendlier guys ive come across at ranges or at courses yards were indeed marked and there are some targets to aim for and even some hazards to aim away from a big red flag to me was the extra charge  to hit off the grass i am no range expert but this is the th one ive been to and the first ive seen of that sort of nickel and dimingprice for the golf balls was reasonable and i do plan to be back every week until they close up in october for the season hopefully since its for sale it will reopen as a golf facility again|i drove by yesterday to get a sneak peak  it reopens on july th and i cant wait to take my kids  the new range looks amazing  the entire range appears to be turf which may or many not help your game but it looks really nice  the tee boxes look state of the art and the club house looks like something youll see on a newer course  cant wait to experience it|thank you rob i truly appreciated all the help i received from this agent today who was able to removed the extra charges on my bill that the pasadena verizon store on lake was charging me on my bill for upgrading my phone   when i went in i was having problems with my blacberry and had to switch to the iphone last week rob from the pennsylvania store who i was connected today was able to look at my bill and all the notes and correct the problem immediately great customer service he even set up a follow up phone call with me on july th to make sure the credit goes through on my billi cant thank him enough|this place should have a lot more reviews  but im glad it doesnt they dont need to get any busierits been there ages and looks it if youre all about ambiance dont bother if you pretend youre in a movie set in pittsburgh  years ago it works pretty well the service is sometimes hit or miss most of girls are good one is very slow one is amazing they are all friendly and usually a few different people will check in to make sure that youre happy everything is made fresh so be prepared that nothing comes flying out of that kitchen  busy times it can take a good while to get food the food is awesome worth any little complaints i might think up before it gets there once its on the table i forget them allfish sandwiichsalmon huge and deliciousfloundershrimp a few ways norfolk style is oily for my taste and i never had it growing up in norfolkhawkins st specialprime rib sized for two watch itthe prices are low the portions are large and just about everything on the menu  is delicious im not one to pick a place because they give you a lot of food but if you like a good value and dont want to compromise on taste this place is a gem|this place was very good i found out about emils when watching a show called  things i love about pittsburgh on wqed hosted by rick seback this place aint a luxurious restaurantits a beer  a shot bar  lounge but the people are friendly  the food is good i had the fish sandwich which was great it aint in a great part of town rankin but ive been in worse places try this place|this place was delicious  my parents saw a recommendation to visit this place from rick sebaks  things i like about pittsburgh and hes usually pretty accurate  his recommendations were to try the reuben fish sandwich and openfaced steak sandwich  we went early afternoon for a late lunch today a saturday and were seated right away  the staff is extremely friendly  my mom  i each had the fish sandwich while my dad  brother had a reuben sandwich  the fish was very good but the reuben was to die for  both dishes were massive and could very easily be shared between two people  on top of being extremely large portions it was incredibly affordable  the giant fish sandwich was  and the giant reuben was   our drinks were always filled and we were checked on several times during the meal  we will definitely be back  oh and a bit of advice ahead of time  they take cash only  so come prepared but im pretty sure i saw an atm there as well  and i do believe they are closed on sundays  mondays|old schooltraditional mom n pop quality and perfection the best fish and chips youll ever enjoy and equally superb fried shrimp a great out of the way noncorporate vestige of americana you will love it|seen this restaurant on  best places in pittsburgh with rick sebackack went there with my girlfriend she grew up with the owner shes very nice all employees are super nice service was excellent i had the fish sandwich my girlfriend had the ruben more than you could possibly eat very reasonable prices going back to try the burgers  i heard there enormous and very tasty|like a lot of recent patrons i heard about emils from wqed  the food is spectacular the owner chrissy and the staff treat you like family  the food is like something your grandmother would make  classic dishes that are always consistently great and memorable|wonderful reuben  map shown on yelp page is incorrect it is actually a different hawkins  id recommend a call for directions |cant miss stop for the best fish sandwich in pittsburgh|after a morning of thrift store hunting a friend and i were thinking of lunch and he suggested emils after hed seen chris sebak do a bit on it and had tried it a time or two before and i had not he said they had a decent reuben but to be prepared to step back in timewell seeing as how im kind of addicted to late s and early s and the whole rat pack scene stepping back in time is a welcomed change in da burghas long as it doesnt involve  which i can see all around me every dayand yet another shot at finding a decent reuben in da burghwell thats like hunting the holy grail so looking under one more bush certainly wouldnt hurtso off we go right at lunchtime in the middle ofwhere exactly were we at first i thought we were lost driving around a handful of very rather dismal looking blocks in what looked like a neighborhood that had been blighted by the building of a highway and thenaha here it is and yep there it was this little unassuming building with an addon entrance with what looked like a very old hand painted sign stating quite simply emils we walked in the front door and entered another world another time and another place oh and any big burritosousa foodies might as well stop reading now i wouldnt want to see you walk in roll your eyes and say reaaaaaallllythis is about as old world barloungerestaurant as it gets plain with a dark wood bar on one side plain white walls with no yinzer pics good sturdy chairs and actual white linens on the tables this is the kind of neighborhood dive that i could see frank and dino pulling a few tables together for some poker a fish sammich and some cheap scotch and that is exactly what i loveohbut good food counts too we each had a reuben and my friend had a side of fries the reubens were decent but not ny awesome a little too thick on the bread but overall tasty and definitely filling not too skimpy on the meat i seriously crave a true good ny reuben but since i cant afford to travel right now what i find in da burgh will have to do but as we sat and ate burgers came out to an adjoining table those were some big thick burgers a steak went past for the table behind us that was huge and when we asked about it the waitress said yeah its huge and really good and he only charges  for it aint that nuts another table of five came in and wham fish sandwiches piled with breaded fish that looked amazing yeah i want that that that and thatmy friend also mentioned that they have a chicken parm special one day of the week that is only served until  pm and that it is fantastic if only i could get there on that week day before the waitress did a good job especially since there was quite a growing crowd at lunchtime on a saturday and only one of her she kept up and was very friendly they only have pepsi products so i had a brewed iced tea which was very fresh and she did pop by to ask about refills as often as she could as the lunch hour went on they were getting busyemils is no frills good portions very reasonable prices very comfortable neighborhood hole in the wallkind of like cheers but in a blue collar neighborhood in the s fanfreakintastic i could feel at home hereyou definitely want to hit mapquest or plug in your gps though i am not sure that i could find it again on my ownit really is a hidden gem i will be making my friend take me back until i can memorize where the heck it isaddendum nd visit for the fish sandwich excellent truly a pound of fish on a fishshaped bun as opposed to da burghs seemingly popular hamburger bun the fish was flavorful the batter excellent and for just  this may have been the best fish sandwich ive yet to have in da burgh|from reading the other reviews i see this place was on some top  places in pittsburgh list a few years ago  i havent seen it myself but have known of this place for a while before my first visit in   it wasnt until my almost yo buddy mr italo donatucci worlds coolest old italian dude brought me one of the best fish sandwiches i ever had that i became hooked  ive had at least  since then but only during the lent season  i gave my  rating based on the fish sandwich alone  try it without a bun also  either way you get  nice size pieces of fish equal to a pound  you can have your choice of sides but i always get the small mac n cheese for my side  the staff is always really friendly and service is prompt  its in a rough neighborhood but the rankin police station is right across the street  almost every visit there i have seen police officers inside mingling with the locals or picking up lunch orders  soon i plan to make a visit thats not a friday during lent to try other menu items|another divey place we have been going to for years my dads favorite as he knows the original owners certain items on the menu are named after the kids huge portions might have a bit of a wait some nights huge burgers fish sandwiches salads decent service|love my hometown favorites cannot beat their fish sandwiches although i do miss the buns as opposed to the sliced breadstop that always will support emilsother favorites include reuben hawkins avenue sandwich chrissy club|i love everything about this place the food is delicious yes yes the fish sandwiches ok i agree  but did you try the meatballs holy tamoley i adore the staff and i love that there are no windows  its its own little hermetically sealed s world of delicious real food and good people lots of places try to create this kind of ambiance but it cant be manufactured it takes decades of good food and good vibesalso the food is really good |we have been coming here for over  years consistantly good food and friendly staff vwey reasonably priced and large portions the owner chrissy has taken what emil started years ago and built it into a place we will return to again and again favorites are the fish and burgers hard to pick one|i had a hankering for some fried fish tonight and the fish fry at maximilian kolbe was going to close before i got home on the bus and i suggested to my wife and  yearold daughter that we try emils lounge as wqeds rick seback loved the place as did andrew zimmern when he visited for the bizarre foods america episode featuring pittsburgh  the place is in rankin  a rough around the edges town in the mon valley between swissvale and braddock  dont be put off at first  the outside doesnt have much decoration to speak of and looks like the sort of place that you might think twice about it  a tgi fridays it isnt and thank god for thatthe place is wellkept but a little dated   no fripperies here  but were not here for the decor  were here for some dinner  the menu is basic with reasonable prices  the meats and seafood are high quality and everything is made to order  their stuffed cabbage is regarded as the best in  pittsburgh  i love stuffed cabbage but i just made a batch a couple of weeks ago and im cabbaged out  their ruebens are   also killer our waitress raved about them  my wife and i both settled on fish sandwiches  these are true pittsburgh fish sammiches  fresh fried fish in crispy breading crammed between enormous pillows of soft yet chewy and crispy mancinis italian bread  no adornments  just a boatload of hot crispy fish  emils uses thick cod fillets piled high rather than a thin fillet that needs to be broken up to fit in the bun  truly a great sandwich  my daughter had the blt  looked good and on good bread and they werent skimpy with the baconthe service was very pleasant and friendly and the crowd was a great group of folks  we all had fun with  other tables when my wife pulled up a trivial pursuit game on her iphone and pretty much everyone joined in and had a good laughoverall if you consider yourself a true pittsburgher  you must visit this place  its one of the few places big jims in the run is another where the spirit of pittsburgh is alive and hungry  please go|we had gone to the frick mansion for a tour and i told my friends we were stopping off for a lunch in rankin there wasnt much enthusiasm about the location but the reluctantly agreed  we stopped in front and my wife said we arent going in there are we well once the order the food and enjoyed the best reuben  fish sandwich and stuffed peppers they were sold the owner came over and thanked us for stopping she is a real asset to the place the restrooms were spotless which important to my wife i have taken places where she had to hover  over the commode i went back two days later for the hulushki a real gem a perfect place to eat real comfort food dont forget the liver and onions|excellent fish sandwich wonderful reuben sandwich even the stuffed cabbage tastes homemade   chrissy is a delightful hostess and makes you feel welcome  restaurant personnel are pleasant   i really enjoy visiting emils when im in town   my only regret is that they are closed mondays   worth the trip|this is a hidden gem no really it took us forever to find but well worth it it is right across the street from the rankin police station the menu has a wide selection i really couldnt decide what i wanted but i went with the ribeye sandwich im glad i did too huge sandwich i added mushrooms it was very flavorful my boyfriend got the fish sandwich he enjoyed it as well fast and friendly service will definitely be back|this would be my local haunt if i were ever to relocate to the pittsburgh area what a great little place such friendly staff and some damn good eats it was so great that we actually went there twice during our day vacation to catch the steelersravens game they have daily sandwich specials on thursday night we went and had the special roast beef and cheese sand and the  cent wings very very tasty im sorry but this place kicks primanti bros butt on the taste factor they have about  different types of wings reg garlic and i cant remember the rest  we got the regular and i was wishing we would had ordered moregoing back on a friday night we ordered the buffalo chicken pizza and a pepperoni n mushroom  wow that buffalo chicken pizza was awesomethe other thing that stuck out for me was one of the customers an older gentleman he seemed to be a regular i really really wanted his spam tshirt|a great townie bar with tasty food and an interesting clientele i went to check this place out on the way home from the airport one friday night and it didnt disappoint it is refreshing to walk into a townie bar and not feel like the music stops and everyone in the place is staring at you  im guessing the mixed crowd of older hockey fans young men in collared shirts and thirtysomethings have probably seen it all during their time at this place the staff was top notch  the orders were somewhat overwhelming as they appeared shortstaffed for the night but my waitress tried to keep a positive attitude for my entire visit the other waiter was wearing a hooded cardigan and i wanted to steal it from him due to my difficulty in finding such a quality article of clothingwe ordered a white pizza  large in size engulfed in cheese full of garlic flavor flavorful hot sausage an overall delicious pizza aside from  things  way too much grease i know this comes with the territory but still it is sometimes unbearable  canned mushrooms  the worst thing to come out of a can ever i would rather eat canned alpo than canned mushrooms and if the mushrooms werent canned they were just the worst mushrooms ive ever consumed the mushroom debacle is enough to lower the review by an entire star  disgustingmy advice for the place is keep everything awesome  random music from the jukebox tasty food great prices good crowd and staff  and get some decent mushrooms why they spoil an otherwise above average pie with such inferior crap ill never know|alexions has been around forever  the first time i went in there i was  years old on summer break from college and working at the ice cream factory up the hill  all of the union guys from the ice cream factory went in there after work and i immediately found out why  many many years later i stopped in there with some fond memories and once again felt welcomed and valued as a customer even though they didnt know who i was  the sandwiches are done pittsburghstyle sort of like primantis and they are as perfect today as they were back in ancient times when i first started visiting the place  alexions is a clean and peaceful little place in the rook station part of green tree the oldest part of the town  i recall that some of the sandwiches i got there were ordered at a pretty late hour  nothing but good things to say about the place and i wish it was closer to home|what a cool barrestaurant i will no doubt be visiting again  the service and prices were great and the restrooms were clean   i had the buffalo chicken sandwich and it was delicious  the menu consists of typical bar food food however theres a few different items on there which stand out on the menua cool bar off the beaten path that is a worth a trip  cheers  |awesome drink specials during happy hour fantastic wings that are crispy and delicious wing night on tuesday and thursday|grew up near here the family would always go once a month havent stopped in for a few years until last friday with a few friends to grab a drink the sandwiches are always amazing just as i remember the staff is amazing and friendly great place for lunch as well|let there be no question alexions owns the best cheeseburger in the region and they have now for decades try a burger on italian bread the service is flawlessly friendly the food is amazing and the wings oh the wings but its still about the cheeseburger the atmosphere is inviting but you cant eat atmosphere so go right now grab the car keys you know youre hungry for an amazing cheeseburger maybe some wings and a cold beer easily hands down the best bar and grill in pittsburgh|the sandwiches the wings enough said alexions can best be described as a homestyle primantis before they went mega commercial you really cant go wrong but for my money i would put alexions fish sandwich up with the best ive had thats not to take away from other selections but if you come here i recommend not leaving until youve had either the fish sandwich reuben or wings youll know youre in a pittsburgh bar when you walk in for someone who lives in atlanta now and only makes it to pittsburgh a few times a year i have to say it is refreshing feels like home i havent had a trip back without making it out to alexions at least once|friendly staff good food great beer selection and relaxing atmosphere great wings and the buffalo chicken pizza is the best ive had the sandwiches are all on thick cut italian bread and fresh definitely  a hidden gem of the greetreecarnegie area looking for a low key hole in the wall with good prices and great food this is your place|found this place on yelp and glad we did great beer selection the sandwiches are wonderful and huge wings were very good family owned establishment and everyone we met was great the owner waitstaff and kitchen staff  if we ever get to the pittsburgh area again we will go back|perfect joint dont be afraid as you pull up its a nice little neighborhood was in town on biz and my hotel was right up the street great service well apportioned servings and unique menu make this place worthy of a check in|contrary to other reviews i have zero complaints about the service or the prices i have been getting tire service here for the past  years now and compared to my experience with places like pep boys these guys are experienced and know what theyre doing also this is one place that i do not feel like i am being taken advantage of just because of my gender other auto mechanics have been notorious for capitalizing on my ignorance of cars and have sucked my bank account dry but here my service and road coverage has all been well explained  and let up to me to decide and they just renovated the waiting room it looks a lot better than it did in previous years|awesome experience   i came in all fatalistic with my flat tire on a workday morning with a full schedule they saw me and worked on my car like a nascar pit crewi was prepared to buy new tires  they offered to look to see if they could repairthey repaired them  i saved alot of money  integrity greatcustomerservice|i took my wifes car in for new tires on good friday i felt that the prices were reasonable i didnt feel pressured to buy the most expensive tire and i was out in less than  hours with no appointment|most random location for a mini golf course ever  this is old school its built into the woods spray yourself for bugs first right off forsythe rd near carnegie park  the candy hut is fun to spend your spare change  they recently recarpeted the holes and added a few gimmicks that werent there before  it wont knock your socks off but if youre local give it a try|i think this place is closed their number is out of service sign is gone and the course has not been maintained awesome woodsy mess of a course though|this quaint mini golf course is one of the oldest yet most original and fun locations that i have yet visited  coming from texas it was nice to see a course located amongst the hilly and woody pennsylvanian terrain it can be frustrating that it is literally impossible to make a holeinone on most every hole and that the course also makes it extremely difficult to predict the direction on how the ball will follow through and bounce  the cartoonlike outrageousness of the course proved to give laughs and a fun attempt to play  improvements were being made and i will look forward to returning on my next visit to the pittsburgh area  i enjoy traveling and visiting new courses and the only reason why i didnt give this location  stars is because it was impossible to intuitively shoot the ball for a best effort to beat par|ive been informed by a fellow yelper that they are just closed for the season i hope theyre right i find it strange they dont keep their phone number in service with a recording and that they didnt cover the course up to protect it from weather vandalism etc either way i cant wait to get my game on in the spring|when i wanted a deck for the back of my home i ended up calling quaker state construction it ended up working very well and they were very polite i got an estimate and called them to start working out the details of my new deck once we got the plans all sorted out they started building my new deck and it was finished with in a reasonable amount of time i now have a beautiful deck that i can relax and that my family can enjoy overall they did a good job and i would use them in the future for all my deck necessities|our cat went out the other night and must have gotn into a fight he was wounded but we could not tell the extent of his injuries my girlfriend called them today and they made an appt for us immediately  when we got there i couldnt believe how friendly and caring they all were we went into the exam room with doctor tierney kelley and a vet asst sam they were the best so gentle and caring they did not pressure us into any procedures that my cat did not need they worked hard so we didnt have to leave him over night this was by far the best veterinarian i have gone to in all my years as a pet owner this has all become a racket for making money doctors dont care about the animals in  of the places you go but greetree animal clinic is not one of those places i will be taking my other pets there from now on and recommend this place and doctor kelly to everyone i know thank you so much again if you read this doctors kelley youre the best|greentree animal clinic is the absolute best  we have had both dr mann and dr reuther  both are very good each in their own strengths  i recently had to have my beloved dog euthanized due to a tumor growing on his hip  dr mann was very sensitive and caring to my feelings of loss  he offered to make a clay paw print from my dog after he passed  he went above and beyond to make sure he had a peaceful passing with me by his side  thank you for allowing me that experience and for guiding me through the process|i cannot praise this place enough i have worked as a vet tech in a previous job and have had experiences at numerous facilities here in pittsburgh and greentree animal clinic blows them all out of the water key things that you should note about this place they do not over charge they only recommend servicesthings that they genuinely believe will help your pet not their bottom line and they do not pressure you in any way they are respectful and genuine to you and your pet which is hard to come by nowadays everyone from the front desk to the techs to the vets are kind patient and understanding no condescension or poor attitudes just positive vibes all around  dr brown goes above and beyond any vet ive ever met he has shown so much care professionalism  kindness and knowledge that i will gladly refer anyone with a pet to him because i know they will be in good hands and his fellow vets dr reuther dr kelley and dr mann  are just as phenomenal thankyou greentree animal clinic for setting the bar where it should be for all veterinary care facilities|awesome historic building high on top of the hill in carnegie home to stage  a theatre group that puts on musicals i recently saw sideshow and evita here great sound and comfortable chairs an all around pleasant experience for a pleasant evening or sunday matinee plenty of free parking and at only  dollars its a true bargain and yes the rumors are true this building is haunted|beautiful restoration of the library and music hall   look forward to coming here for shows|nice suppose to be haunted in carnegie off main st closed sunday during summer during school season open some nights until pm|great people great service great products always busy|ive pretty much been eating at various kings pretty regularly since i was a child when my parents would take my sister and i into the fox chapel location often  lately me and my girl have been visiting the heidelburg location i love the food it really tastes homemade much like something a grandmother would make complete with gobs of butter and side dishes prices are low selection is great but dont expect fine dining by any means service is hit or miss at pretty much all of them if you have lunch at any kings you will likely be waited on by a sweet but sarcastic  older lady who has been doing the waiting thing for  years and knows her game seek out this lady  my experience with the younger crowd at night isnt the sameim in my s now and very little has changed other than the fox chapel location was remodeled about  years ago to look less like a diner which was a big fail  any girl i meet has to enjoy kings or shes out|i heart kings ive always been a fan and this one was as good as my old one in monaca|i arrived around  am on a saturday morning  i was greeted by the hostesswho was polite and friendly and i informed her that i was alone  she had just arrived as well and wasnt exactly sure what was going on yet so she asked the manager where she should seat me  after receiving guidance she brought me to a table towards the back  it had not yet been cleaned after the previous guests had dined  so she quickly got it cleared off grabbed a rag and wiped it downthe waitress came rather quickly to take my drink order  she was extremely friendly  i ordered coffee and water which she went and got while i looked over the menu  she returned and took my order  i ordered the cinnamon swirl french toast special  three slices of french toast made with pittsburghs own jenny lee cinnamon swirl two farmfresh eggs with bacon or sausage i chose sausage and your choice of potato i went with the cheesy hash brown casserole  i also added an orange juice  she went and put my order in while i waited and came back with it after not too long   the eggs were cooked exactly how i wanted them the cheesy hash brown casserole and the french toast were both delicious  i also enjoyed the sausage which was pretty typicalkings family restaurant featured a very friendly staff great prices and tasty food  i am pleased and will definitely come back again|this sns and the one in bethel park are my two favorites  staff always friendly and the deli staff in both locations are great  in my experience if teen staff dont know where something is they ask another staff member  shopping these two stores is as pleasant as it gets|i went to rossis for my first time two weeks ago i had two suits and one jacket tailored everything was ready in less than two weeks these suits were brand new and on the expensive side i didnt know who to trust them with i went to rossis because a friend highly recommended them my friend had a tuxedo custom made by rossis i am extremely happy with the end resultsi wanted a european cut on jackets and no break on the slacks a nice tailored look the suits look awesome im going to go through my closet and take some of my older suits to be tailored some of my older suits are a little looser fitting i now like the more tailored european look juliano the owner will shorten the length of my jackets take the sides in and shorten my slacks theyll look brand newas for the price im very happy i wouldnt go to the cheapest barber in town for obvious reason i feel the same about a good tailor as for the service they couldnt be nicer thanks for a job well done|i want to write the greatest review yelp has ever seen i want yelpers from all across this great land to read this review and

on my last visit to pittsburgh i was looking for a nice barpublounge to grab dinner and watch a penguins playoff game  a friend of mine who lived in the area recommended rockys  as i walked in the door i was pleasantly approached by the server and shown a table it was clean welcoming and the lounge was busy it was friday night and the special was the fish fry  i ordered the fish and in the meantime i sipped on a draft brew  the order was delivered to my table in no time  the fish and sides were tasty and the portion size was large as i was watching the game and enjoying the heck out of my dinner i noticed a dessert case with a nice selection of cakes  well needless to say i got a togo box for what was left of my dinner and ordered a slice of cheesecake  another good choice  at the end of night the penguins couldnt pull off the win over the rangers but i definitely have a new go to when im in town  another star could be added for a smoke free environment  i dont smoke but i understand they have a nice outdoor area for those who do|readers of my reviews may recall that i once referred to the dorstop as possibly the best breakfast in pittsburgh  well faithful followers i must now admit that the dorstop has now been verified as only one of the best  why  thats because gab and eat i have now found to be the best breakfast ive ever had  if it was closer to my home i would quickly become a regulari easily decided to order the mixed grill half  before i go on i must askhas anyone seen a full order  because i honestly cant imagine how much food that is  i created my own with bacon cheese eggs and potatoes  based on reviews i also opted to get a side of the sausage and was pleased as punch when our waitress asked if i wanted hot or sweetor one of each  i like variety so i jumped on the change to try both  i also selected the italian toast  what other kind is there really  when my food arrived it looked delicious  there was so much bacon that after eating half of my mixed grill it looked like id barely started  the sausage was great just dont ask me which one i liked best  my toast   thick slices that looked to be about half the loaf and were buttered on both sides it was a struggle but i was determined to enjoy every tasty morsel and not leave a crumb   in case anyone is wondering yes they use real butter  i saw pounds of it stacked in the kitchen

register that said we need mugs just makes me love this place even morea few tips  order the mixed grill   cash only   gab and eat is a popular place but also very small and narrow or cozy if you will

yelpers rating putting it  for breakfast in pittsburgh area we have to agree with most other reviewers that this is a place to eatwe arrived around noon on saturday and were happy there were a couple open tables the place is tucked at the end of a strip mall and you have to look to find it there is plenty of parkinginside the decor is quaint and funky at the same time country style decorations and signs are mixed with nostalgia signs  posters most interesting are all the signatures and comments written on the wall by past customers we regretted not having a marker to add ours the other highlight was three large white boards with trivia questions  fun way to spend time waiting for foodthe waitstaff there isuh experienced they are attentive pleasant and efficientafter reading reviews i had to try the mixed grill but s went with pancakes with a side of bacon the pancakes were outstandingmaybe the best either of us has eaten they were thick but with light texture and rich flavor his bacon was cooked just as requested  as crisp as possible  and very flavorfulthe mixed grill is a mixed together concoction of eggs potatoes onions peppers cheese and spicy italian sausage grilled together im glad i heeded those who stressed going with the half size order it filled a full sized dinner plate with a heaping order i couldnt finish it all and thats rare how do they serve the whole potion  in a trougheverything was cooked well the sausage added a nice bite to offset the somewhat plain potatoes you can build your own mix but the basic was a good mixmy only complaint was the amount of potato and that they are pretty plain i like home fries with lots of seasoning that have aged on the grill these potatoes were pretty uniform chunks with little seasoning personal preferenceit usually comes with italian toast but they were out so i went with raisin it was delicious soft inch thick slicescoffee was excellent and the cup stayed full the total was less than

across from the dairy queen  the grill is right up front so you can see them cooking   they have counter space for eating and tablesbooths for    dont expect to sit at one table if you have more than  they have a great looking breakfast menu   we all got burgers of varying kinds  they were tasty   the buns were buttered toasted and soft  yum   the amount of butter didnt bother me  but it did my whiny mother who whined even though there is a no whining sign as you walk in the door   we ordered fresh cut fries as onion rings  both of which were great  the half order was plenty and a nice option to a full order   the restaurant was full of local men at lunch which is usually a good sign  i give it a  star only because of the waitress who kind of threw straws silverware and napkins at us as she walked behind the counter  at least she didnt throw the food when it came   she also served the fries and onion rings way before our burgers came out which was kind of weird   they were nice and hot but would have been cold had we waited for the burgers   it didnt factor into my four star rating but i deduct a star from nephew because he invited us out to lunch then allowed me pay   just kidding justin   love ya|sadly i have only been here twice only due to the fact it is not really close to my home or work however when i am in the area this is a great cheap eats for both lunch and

spot but they had an hour wait and we had some retail therapy to handle stat gab  eat crossed my mind since i had bookmarked it on yelp over  years ago there was a tiny wait here about  couples in front of us finally  seats at the bar opened up and we decided to eat theresurprisingly we both ordered the same thing mixed grill mine had sausage links and she decided on bacon it was a blast watching all the food being made right before our eyes giant club sandwiches super thick pancakes eggs eggs and more eggs it was a fun time the restaurant is literally a hole in the wall but had good

it is truly everything that a pittsburgh restaurant should be  in addition to being the apple of my nostalgias eye it is also the constant thought of my tummy when im hungry on the weekends  barbs breakfasts cannot be beat but truly any meal you get there you wont regret  everything is made to order with fair portions and great prices my recommendation is a breakfast sandwich on a bagel and a coffee  theres nothing better than drinking from a cup that could have come from your grandmas kitcheni know that gab n eat is nearby and barbs can be a little weird get to with the strange traffic pattern but this really is a gem of carnegie that youve gotta try|great little place treats you like a localeaten here  times a week for a month  same overtime barb is always here|this is a great place to eat and everyone is so friendly i live right down the street from here but unfortunately i have only gone a once trust me i will go here more often the food is great prices are low and the

park carnegie city has a few bars and restaurants|simplerusticlocalwait that is every gordon ramsey reviewmy experience at extended stay america was great the staff was warm and friendly and made it a point to speak to me every morning as i left and when i returned in the evening they went out of their way to provide a confirmation and point me in the direction of restaurants and nightspots when needed if i ever need to utilize an extended stay hotel i wouldnt hesitate to head back there|tonya is super sweet and the front desk people are very helpful|ive stayed at a couple of extended stay sites that i found quite satisfactory and this location proved to be just as good excellent place to stay while visiting pittsburgh it is just a five minute drive to downtown location is in a business park area so it is quiet the rooms contain a nice kitchenette area with a full sized refrigerator sink cabinets and two burners there is no oven which i expected as the descriptions all state full kitchen so be aware of that also they do not keep the dishes pots and pans coffee makers toasters or utensils in the rooms if you want them you have to request them at the desk during check in the room was clean and well maintained cable tv quality is spotty sometimes but not intolerable the free wifi is usually fast the best part about this location was the staff the people at the desk were all very pleasant and welcoming and quite willing to assist with any questions or issues with a smile  i would definitely stay at this location again and highly recommend it|i have said it on other sites and will repeat here you must try their burgers they are juicy and delicious with a bun that is perfect another must are the fries with guinness gravy and if you havent had enough go for the ultimate sleeper leek and potato soup authentic black  tans harp and murphys on tap it dont get no better this is a true gem my friends|be warned dont expect the best service ever its not the cleanest place youve been in either the decor is soccer jerseys from places and teams youve probably never heard of its divey eclectic and authentic if youre looking for good irish food and a cold pint you cant go wrong at the pour house like most of carnegies main st this is a hidden gem worth seeking out they have some of the best irish food ive had in pittsburgh the colcannon is awesome and the shepherds pie is out of this world if youre not looking for irish food then try the grilled cheese and make sure you ask it with the three cheeses together its big and the cheese is thick and gooey i get it with a side of potato pancakes yum also they have guinness smithwicks and harp on tap|best irish food in the burgh  great bar food too  the service is maybe a bit surly and its not the cleanest nor the best decor  but thats not what this place is about  its a town irish bar and it serves great solid irish fare and suds to the locals  and it does it better than anyone  i go back again and again|recommended  inch pizza on special was cheap fast service not the best pizza but above average|having certain businesses with skill sets in your local neighborhood is important  i try to keep it as local as possible so when i heard about a tailor in carnegie i was intrigued  the building is in a strip mall across from carnegie coffee company  unassuming looks like it is closed all the time until you do a drive by and see the hours posted  there is a latino man in his s working when you arrive  in my mind i imagine a tailor to be older kind of like my grandfather maybe with measuring tape around his neck textbook movie tailor so i was a bit trepidatious about dropping off my clothing  he asks you to go change into a closet yes a closet to change in with one lightbulb but all my worries aside the moment he started working on my items i knew he was the real deal he learned from his father at the age of  how to sew and he does things the correct way  meaning for example  i took in a pair of khakis all the way down to the cuff but he seamed them up to look exactly the way they were when i first bought them  most placed will have bulges and puckers  the rest of my items were just as perfect  very inexpensive at  for a pair of pants to adjust the hem  the items were done in a timely manner  he takes his business very seriously  while i was there i watched a lady rush in and demand  shirts to be altered in an hour and he did it and charged the same price  really nice guy please go and support this business to keep him around town|new to area and decided to pay this shop a visit it was definitely the best experience ive ever had with a tailor he is much cheaper than the other shops he charges  while others charge  and he goes above and beyond for what he chargesi dropped off  jeans and he hemmed and tapered the jeans i couldnt even tell the difference between the store bought jeans and the quality of his work it was absolutely perfect no bulges or puckers they the match the exact stitch as the factory absolutely a great guy they were all done and waiting for me as promised ill definitely be taking all of my business to this place and would highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a personal tailor who actually cares about his work and building an honest business|i needed alterations done to my suit very quickly like three days quickly not only did filberto at alteration world have it ready the price was beyond reasonable and the work was excellent i plan on bringing all my clothes to him from now onoh and he let me know that they also dryclean wonderful shop|this is the best alteration place i have been to the guy that owns it is extremely helpful and works fast also the prices are so reasonable i wonder how he stays in business he was able to do an alteration on short notice and was very acommodating the alteration i needed doneand fastwas right in the middle of prom season all the other places i called gave me a several week wait but he took me right away i will be back|i just needed a broken zipper replaced on my favorite penguins fleece jacket and a pair of suit pants hemmed  the price was very reasonable and the work done was great  i will go back for all my tailoring needs and highly recommend if you need any done|my bridesmaid dress alterations were perfect i would not hesitate to come back for alterations or dry cleaning|so happy i found this place im new to the pittsburgh area and wasnt sure if it was worth driving to carnegie to come here but yelp convinced me it was completely worth the trip since it would have been a long trip to come back the guys at alteration world finished my work patching a hole on a pair of jeans in less than half an hour i killed time at an adorable coffee shop across the street and exactly as i had specified oh and the price was extremely reasonable as well thanks yelp for another great find|the service quality and speed of alteration world are incredible i have had suits and pants altered here and have been thoroughly impressed by the work everything has fit perfectly and the work was quality i will be returning here exclusively for my tailoring needs and have

dont treat you like a number|chose dennys for a very late pm sunday brunch no wait quickly greeted and served i ordered the half size of moon over my hammy it was just the right amount of food for me and the hash browns were delicious only thing lacking was franks red hot  son and husband very pleased with their meals cant remember the names but see pic patron next to us gave us  off  check so our total came to  would go back again for a casual meal|i like the food at dennys more than meals served at pricier restaurants my favorite is the bourbon chicken skillet even though it isnt advertised as being glutenfree it doesnt have any ingredients containing wheat just chicken potatoes and broccoli in a yummy jack daniels sauce both eat n park and max and ermas have gone downhill in the past few years but the food at dennys has gotten better|i belong to this gym  i live in the south section of pittsburgh and i find that this gym is not too far from me  the staff is friendly the equipment is quite good  you get two free personal training sessions when you join  they have lots of weights which my boyfriend uses and a decent cardio room  the only thing i would say is to increase some of the cardio equipment  water is only  a bottle|i really like this gym it is nice neighborhood gym and unlike big gyms they dont have big contracts and they have flexible memberships great selection of classes all the instructors are very good knowledgable and motivating all the staff working there are super nice their selection of the equipment is good too |as a member for now  years i can honestly say i have never had a negative experience at amerifit  the owner and staff could not be more accommodating and strive for member satisfaction  the owner not only runs the business but personally fixes machines when needed interacts with the members and also personally salts and plows the parking lot when needed in the winter himself  there is another review on here stating the lot didnt have any attention after which was the largest ice storm weve had in years i would like to state i was sitting by the counter the day this lady came in upset and unnecessarily yelling at the front desk employee about the lot  the owner was out there every couple hours doing the best he could to tame the condition of the lot however on that day i believe everyones car on the road turned into a snow sled including my own  if you truly felt in danger being on the roads that day you probably should of just stayed at home or a worki love the fact the owner takes pride in his business and is extremely hands on with the maintenance of the building  amerifit has such a welcoming no intimidation homelike feel which is what i believe makes this place so special and unique and has kept my loyal membership for the last  years|papa js is by far my favorite restaurant in pittsburgh my hometown  i eat there almost every time i visit and everything ive ever ordered has been fantastic  fresh ingredients simple preparation reasonable prices  also they make the best pizza in town hands down|this is one of my husbands fave restaurants in town my husband generally orders chicken parm which is very good their sauce is quite good they serve fresh bread with a plate of olive oil and balsamic vinegar for dipping  yum i generally order one of their house salads think it has a specific name but cant recall off the top of my head which has mixed greens and i get it with blue cheese pine nuts and their yummy vinaigrette a tad pricey for a salad thats just lettuce and cheese i want to say about  with the extras but really good especially with some cracked black peeper i tend to follow this up with a smaller plate like their red pepper app or the greens  beans the place has sort of a rustic atmosphere and can be on the loud side it has a comfortable feeling it also has a solid wine by the glass selection  better than a lot of places in the burgh unfortunately weve never had dessert there bc we get so full of bread and dinner|i brought my husband and my parents all to papa js last time my husband and i were in pittsburgh my parents are really picky about their italian food usually they drive places in east bumf tarentum ligonier to get their capital italianmy pop is kinda grumbly and getting him to try something new is like pulling teeth the only reason i got him here was becuase they were on their way to drop us at the airportwell my dad goes back now regularly and that says a lot considering he lives in murrysville the first good sign dad was happy was that he seemed impressed when it was open it was noon a few days after christmas second good sign was that dad ordered wine at it was only  pm dad while not a teetotaler rarely has a drink before  pm so i know he was anticipating a good meal the kicker was that he was so happy he left our waitress a  tip on a  meal can i say i live in texas now and i still relive this afternoon back in december i had chicken picattait was perfect my dad had eggplant rollatini my mom had a pizza and my hubby had basic pasta and marinara it all was amazing delicous and inexpensive in austin you cant get a decent italian meal much less a decent italian meal for under  for four peoplei know there are so many good italian places in pittsburgh but i just think back so fondly on this daywhen me dad liked someplace i took him |thanks yelpers for this find the service the plating the ambiance were wonderful i had the eggplant parmigiana and it was good  but different it was thinly sliced like deli meat and wasnt breaded it was fried in a very light batter|i went there for dinner last night with a client  this is second time i visited  i had a scotch and he had a guiness  the  is for drink selection just stock some better beers and higher end scotch and youre five starswe started with the meatballs covered with provolone and other blessed goodness  these did not disappoint  i had a four cheese pizza with sweet sausage and garlic  it was fantastic  they have so many good dishes but i wanted the pizza last night  i couldnt finish the pizza  way to go big medium pizzai finished up with a coffee  the parking can be a bit of a challenge on the street but its a small town atmosphere in carnegie pa  i love the downtown there|great authentic classic italian restaurant in one of the most unlikely places i grew up eating here and make a visit nearly every time i come to towntry the fried calamari roman style for a little kick|yay im a fan but sometimes service is a little slow it was very good for us this visit  go to papa js every once in a while but mostly for the white pizza  it is the best white pizza i have ever had  order the white pizza on our visit this  weekend it has garlic spinach feta cheese and we usually add some veggie on top  it was delicious  order fried calamari and it was oknote to self next time try the calamari roman stylelike the dinning room with the hardwood floors and bright lighting  the bar was jumping thou never go to the bar|yay im a fan of the white pizza  had take out  the bar was jumping when i picked up our orderthe white pizza is so deliciouswith garlic spinach feta and added some veggies  tried the roman style calamari very good better than the fried calamari we had last time|what a wonderful surprise found in carnegie pa just south of pittsburgh  i was in town on business with a couple coworkers and after having a not so great meal the night before we asked one of the locals for a recomendation  they told us to try this little italian place called papa js and boy did they send us to a great placefirst off when you walk up to the place the front and side windows give you a fantastic open view into the kitchen from the outside  you can stand outside and watch the chef making all the wonderful food and you can smell the fresh bread before you even walk in the doori am not sure how long this place has been around but the kitchen looked well used while the dining area as well as the bar looked very clean and modern almost as if it had been freshly updated  the server was quick to welcome us and suggested several different items off the menu as his favorites when asked  the three of us were very hungry and wanting to try a few different things so we began with a margherita pizza which was absolutely perfect  they obviously make their own breads and dough for the pizza and i dont think this pizza could have tasted any better  then came bowls of italian wedding soup which was pretty good  of everything there this was the one item i probably could have done without  not that it was bad but there was nothing particularly special about it  we also ordered the garlic rolls not that the bread they already give you and the pizza was not enough carbs for  meal and they were to die for  crunchy on the outside and warm and chewy inside these things were a meal by themselves  one of the guys with me said the pizza sauce would be good on them so he ordered a cup of the pizza sauce which is fresh made there not out of some can and he was right  as if these little killer bread balls with garlic were not good enough dipped in the pizza sauce they were even that much better  by the time our meals came we were all pretty full but we pushed on and continued to eat  i had the veal parmigiano which was tender and very good  it came with a side of pasta which i tasted just to try and it was excelent as well  had i not been eating a weeks worth of carbs in one sitting with all the premeal stuff i certainly would have finished it  as it was i ate most but not all of the generous portion of veal  one of my coworkers had the chicken picatta which he said was one of the best he had ever had and the other guy tried a pasta dish which he said was very good as well  they had a great wine selection as well at reasonable prices by the glass or bottleoverall a fantastic experience with great food and atmosphere  i dont really know how expensive the area is for food but coming from the chicagoland area i fouknd this place to be pretty reasonable  the three of us ate very very well for an average of aproximately  each not including alcahol  fantastic fresh food at a reasonable price who could ask for moremy only complaint is that i had to return to chicago and i am now craving to return to papa js  i hope work sends me out here again sometime soon|we met our good friends from morgantown here for lunch today and were really impressed with the place itself and the menu i had read a few of the reviews ahead of time and the pizza was mentioned more than once so by the time we got there i was jonesing for it it certainly delivered the crust was great the sauce wast too sweet and the toppings were sufficient our friend for the baby clams with oil and garlic over angel hair and let me try a bit  as good as the pizza was this was much better well return again to this beautifully lit gem in carnegie pa soon|great little gem the food was fantastic was very food and just the right price the italian food was amazing but you can not leave without a dessert and be prepared for giant serving i had the carrot cake yummy def a place everyone should try|ok its friday night and have about  minutes to eat driving by papa js and w says lets stop in and get a quick dinner advice host that we are in a hurry  the host advised us it is a  minute service the place was crowded we were seated at the last open table however our waiter jason said he will do his best to get as out on time we ordered our dinner immediately with a salad and a glass of wine in a few minutes we had our wine then in a few more seconds we had our salads and some great homemade italian bread with some olive oil and balsamic ving for dipping  yumjust as we were finishing our salads our dinners were delivered great job jason the fettuccine carbanara was very good a thick cream sauce with bacon and ricotta  in and out in  minutes  now that is some good service|this is a regular goto for me i love the food and the service they always have the wine that i like and the food is always delicious i suggest trying the flourless chocolate cake in the front of the store in the section where you can buy stuff to take home it is sublime and makes you want to go to a special cozy corner just to eat it and revel in its velvety loveliness|i thought the interiors were very nice  we stopped here on a friday night  i was glad they werent busy because nothing else in the area looked appetizing  my daughter  i split a chicken parm sandwich which was really good instead of it being served on a hoagie it was served on thin bread like focaccia or something  it was pretty good little messythe desserts looked amazing  i thought it was pretty cool how you can watch the cooks prepare the food from outside  the kitchen is situated on a corner with lots of windowsi would return|san francisco california visitor liked the food and the local is great i am thinking about relocating to pttsbrgh area i liked carnegie because u can stroll down main street and hit a couple places for lunch i imagine this place would be crazy busy on friday or saturday night we ate a lunchtime and it was nice|great place for dinner drinks or a small celebrationpapa js is one of my favorite go to places for dinner when we dont have reservations and want a nice dinner out my husband and i have eatten here upwards of  times over the last few years and have never been disappointed i assumed that when they opened the alternate bar with lounge area and extra tables for dining on the other side of the resturant that  the overall vibe of the restaurant would change and it would be very busy i have been proved wrong  we are always able to walk in on a weekend and get a table within a few minutes unfortunately the alternate barlounge area isnt always open i really dont understand why more people dont go here my favorites are the fried zucchini wedding soup and pizzathe zucchini is always crispy and seasoned well the wedding soup has big chunks of carrots and celery my husband also enjoys the pork entrees especially the grilled pork and the pastas including the tomato cream sauce also their homemade italian bread with oil and vinegar to dip is a great way to wet your appetite make sure to add the parmesan cheese that they put on the table also if you are looking for a good place to host a birthday party or event consider papa js they have a great catering menu and are easily able to accomodate larger parties we had our rehersal dinner for our wedding here and everyone loved the food|very good restaurant with very good food at a pretty reasonable price  we had a birthday dinner here with seven girlfriends the waitress was very efficient  but not very friendly our orders came out hot and excellently prepared  try the tilapia milanese  its excellent best steamed broccoli ive ever had|i was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant  came here with no expectations  i was greeted by a large open garage style window that opened the whole lounge bar area to the street  it had modern furnishings and the staff were quite friendlyordered the quattro formaggi pizza  quite good  great balance of cheeses  not too rich at all  crust was excellent too  cant wait to come back|i am amazed that people can write negative reviews about papa js   i have been a return customer since the early s and the food quality and service are way above averageand especially for this price rangekudos to management for maintaining such a level of quality and freshness   nothing we had tonight was disappointing and we overordered because each dish was delectablethe best item tonight was the mozzarella appetizer cradled in bread with an authentic marinarathe white pizza with sundried tomatoes was as usual out of this world good   the scallops special appetizer was phenomenalwe will be back|just to start off we were a party of  which is always a little difficult  we were celebrating  birthdayswe loved the food it was delicious my husband got a chicken parm sandwich which is served on a yummy flat bread and i got the chicken basil pizza  i got an  cut and several ppl tried it we all loved it it was stunning  it was made with a very delicious crust nice and crisp not soggy like pesto pizza can getthe one waitress we had jasmine was fantastic  she was bright friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu  she took extra time with the older ladies in our group to help them with their selections now the other waitress mary something was so incompetent  she was awful and rude  she missed  people on that side of the table failed to take their order and when we said something she said well they didnt speak up ugh  then when it was time to sing and cut the cake my sister in law said oh hey can you get the cake so we can sing  she came back cut the cake all crazy with some huge pieces and some super small pieces like she never in her life cut a sheet cake and we didnt even sing  we were madthe place is so pretty they have a new addition that was just built within the last  years according to my father in law and its really nice  they look to have a cool bar area with some modern couches and a really sweet look   so good food great looking place one bad waitress prices are about middle of the road for an authentic italian place nothing crazy  all in all wed like to go back again but we want jasmine|the menu has lots of choices and the food is great the resturante has been expanded so its pretty large the new section has door that they leave open during nice weather which makes for a nice ambience the bread is great and fresh baked daily|delicious  everything ive ever had here was great  the white pizza is a must  always amazing  im also a big fan of the chicken piccatta  the bread that they bring to the table is delicious too  they have a wide variety of selections on the menu and they also have nightly specials that always sound great  their prices are also reasonable  overall i highly recommend this place|nd times a charm this place was  starts the first time i came but stepped up large tonight  waitress was righteous and very fun  food was all excellent  caesar salad tastygot with tomatoes big  on that fettuccini carbornara with bacon n smoky cream flavor  cant wait for the leftovers  the white pizza is that star though  the crustdough is heavenly and the flavor is top shelf  i dont throw those accolades out easily especially on pie but this joint serves it up  good vibe great service phenomenal food  ill be back|i love this place the food is always so fresh and delicious the staff is always friendly as well|spinachfeta cheese salad  bpesto alfredo penne   acoconut cake huge piece  abread small portions  bservice b host seemed grumpy waitress good but then she got busy price pasta was  and the portion smallish more like a  dish arrive early on saturday night this place packed after pm|it was just what we were looking for the service was great my husband had the veal sausage on green pepper appetizer in the larger size it was great spicy and enough for a meal i had the stuffed eggplant that was very good but the sauce could have been a bit heartier i would definitely go back really nice atmosphere and free parking in the back|some of the best chow aroundlove this place the bread and salads and soups are great|finally great tuscanstyle italian food in pittsburgh not that tasteless stuff that locals think is italianthe bread was warm and fresh the bolognese sauce was creamy and rich and unlike most restaurants was made with veal i love the fresh smell of baking bread throughout the restaurantim looking forward to working my way through the menu of chicken options and next time im saving room for dessert the display of cakes and pastries at the door was amazing|this place has been a favorite for  years since we returned from a trip to italy having several weeks of fabulous fresh food and couldnt think of any place we wanted to eat papa js measures up to our expectations with great salads bead and wine im partial to the eggplant rollatini and my husband likes samplers ravioli fish white pizza i like the space with exposed brick wallsthere are knowledgeable servers sometimes it is a bit loud more noticable when it is empty with a large table nearby but dont get the wrong impression its a great placeconsistantly great food|wonderful food some items a little over priced but never disappointedi have friends that love the white pizza i have seen two people eat their weight in the stuffi love their fresh salads huge the house dressing is perfect every time we have been there many times and it just doesnt get oldwe always have the beans and greens the meatball appetizer is superb bypass the chicken parm its the only thing we have ever found lackingits just really plain the alfredo is excellentwe almost never go anywhere else in carnegie because we like this place so much|many trips to pittsburgh over  years  first time here  had the gnocchi special  one of the best gnocchi i have ever had  pizza was excellent  service was great|did dinner with my gf last saturday at papa js prior to going to the off the wall theater this was the first time weve been to this restaurant we usually stop a rileys pour house across the street for a bite before seeing a show in this town but today we decided to shake it up and do something differentthe place is deceptively larger than it looks from the outside it was also busier than we would have expected on this particular evening and we got one of the remaining tables which was located near the entrance and the bar the traffic from both the customers and the staff that flowed past us was a little noisy and distracting and we could tell thats why it was one of the last tables available but our waitress came by promptly got us drinks i had a hoegaarden and my girl ordered an absolute water and cranberry gave us menus and recited the specials of the dayafter viewing the menu for a bit i decided on the veal parmigiano my date went with one of the specials a chicken and broccoli gnocchi dish the plates took about  minutes to arrive and the portions were humongous enough for a filling lunch the next day my veal was tender and delicious but its really the gnocchi that left the biggest impression you could tell that it was house made it was like little fluffy pillows dissolving in your mouth with each bite i never tasted gnocchi like it beforeover all i give papa js a big thumbs up the food was good most of the dinning areas seemed cozy the building itself has a certain charm with its high ceiling and the tables draped in white table cloths give it a pristine appearance although i thought it was a bit pricy i didnt feel as if ive been taken  other than the location of our table it was the pretheater perfect meal i only hope get a more intimate table next time we stop for dinner|a unique and great find in downtown carnegie my fiance and i came here for a weekend lunch and wanted something different from our usual weekend spots we had the sausage stuffed pepperoncinis as an appetizer these are never my favorite and were just ok but the marinara served with them was very tasty as was their homemade bread i had a really great wood fired meatball ricotta pizza and fiance had the chicken parm sandwich our waiter was very attentive and friendly i ordered a cannoli on the way out the door and it was fantastic not overly sweet crunchychocolate dipped shell stuffed with thick cream and mini chocolate chips amazing we will definitely be back here|we came to carnegie to check out the black lamb consignment shop lucky for us that we also discovered papa jswe loved it the fried calamari appetizer was excellent as was the fettuccine carbonara well be headed back to this place as often as we can for a real italian dining experience|this is it my favorite in the pittsburgh area i moved out of the area for  years and this was the first meal i had back there was a table of italians speaking italian behind me  how much more authentic can you geti bring all of my out of town guests here and not one had been left disappointed my recommendations are to order the mozzarella carozza or however its spelled and then one of the specials if you arent into a special youll be fine  order off the menu but the specials are typically amazing when my better half was living  hours away he drove into town and i made him get back in he car to go here instead if complaining he asked if we could take his parents next time|stopped in for lunch after i got lost due to construction in the area was trying to go to a different place glad the pizza gods were looking out for me ordered a caesar salad with anchovies and a large pizza with sausage and mushrooms the salad was fresh and excellent dressing was made fresh and the anchovies were top notch there is a wide variety of anchovies when it comes to quality and they use excellent ones there was also plenty of them as usually you get a sparse amount the large salad was more that enough for my wife and i they serve a bread basket with two styles of bread pepper cheese and a standard italian with a harder crust they were both so good i purchased a loaf of each on the way out price per loaf was only  no way they make profit on the pepper cheese loaf best value in bread in quite some time i will stop in for the bread whenever i am in the area the pepper cheese i would rate a  out of  the italian was as good as it gets i am a pizza snob and getting a good review from me is tough i am so tough i do not review if i think its bad there pizza is excellent and i would recommend it to anyone remotely close to the place i would ask for a little less sauce i would call it almost ny style slightly thicker crust i asked the waiter if i should order it well done and he said order it as is he was correct and it came out perfect   the waiter and staff were excellent and they informed me that they do not even own a microwave|yummy yum let me get me some  this place rocks went here with the wife and had a great dinner  portions are very generous and the food is delicious  be prepared to pay top dollar though for the entrees but they are worth every penny|i gave them  stars for two reasons   they do not have fresh pasta and  my boyfriends chicken abruzzo was dry the service was attentive and the bread was amazing my carbonara was incredible the main dining room was a nice grotto style reminiscent of rome nice for couples and girlfriends catching up on life i loved the montpluciano in a carafe but dont miss the extensive italian wine list we will definitely return to this carnegie gem|great restaurant had the eggplant parmesan and it was very good bradley was our server and he was on top of things all the time prices are reasonable and the decor is inviting cant wait to go back|we recently decided to celebrate our anniversary at papa js there is a parking lot in the back of the building and the entrance is on the side the food was perfectly prepared served at the proper temperature and was quite delicious portion sizes were quite satisfying the complimentary bread and oil was excellent the service was polite and efficient|one of my favorite places in pittsburgh  reasonable prices  delicious food  only one weird quirk  they dont bring the delicious fresh bread until you order  but it is complementary sometimes they will if you ask nicely but it doesnt come automatically everything is super fresh  my friends  i always order a salad or two as a starter they are huge  dont offer side portions  i strongly recommend the panzanella salad  then any of the pastas seriously they are all good  if you remember to save room for dessert  the cakes are all giant  definitely enough to share probably with a large table|i have never posted to yelp before but in light of the very unpleasant experience had by our friend katie i figured id share a happier one i love the food the prices are great and i think im addicted to their cheesesteaks the staff is always funny and down to earth they make delivery to my job speedy and they even deal with my indecisiveness haha if something was wrong with my food i am sure theyd waste no time fixing the problemi always order a side of fries as theyre huge and taste like potato patch kennywood uhhmayziiing i would and do definiteley recommend capri pizzaplease note i do not stand in opposition to katie i really am sorry to hear of the unhappy experience but i will say that i really do like capri and i appreciate their staff|i judge a pizza joint by their cheese pizza and their pepperoni  while grabbing a brew at voodoo my friends and i were feeling a bit hungry  thankfully a menu was available and capri pizza was just across the street we ordered a small cheese pizza to pick up  i was pleasantly surprised  the cheese was not greasy the sauce was flavorful and the dough was chewy yet crunchy what more could you ask for  we were really impressed with the quality cheesy pizza from caprinext time well try the pepperoni and post an update  i see yummy pizza in our future  if youre grabbing a pint a voodoo and feel a rumbly in your tumbly order something cheesy at capri pizza in homestead|friendly staff same starbucks fair you get anywhere else  sometimes the lines can get long|great location  close to shops and theatre  nice staff|regarding quality of beverage this is just your average starbucks i cant complain but am not blown away either however i really like the location of this shop which is located in the center of the waterfronts specialty retail shops though in the midst of a lot of retail the surrounding area is very picturesque with pretty green grass flowers and a fountain hanging out here is very relaxing|i love the location of this starbucks which is why im giving it  stars its right smack in the middle of clothing stores the loews movie theater as well as restaurants i love grabbing a mid afternoon latte here on a saturday while perusing various stores such as the gap or loft i also like coming here before or after a movie for a quick caffeine joltwhile the drinks are the same as you would find at any starbucks the baristas and staff are really friendly perhaps more so than other area starbucks my drink or choice when i come here generally in the mod afternoon is a venti or trenta berry hibiscus refresher yum it is the perfect afternoon pickmeup that leaves me feeling refreshed and hydrated|this starbucks is star friendly the shift supervisor lucious keeps the energy in there moving and light he recently helped me with a merchandise return and embodied everything a good manager and all around mensch person should  patience kindness generosity and fairness i left that afternoon loving starbucks even more than when i went in its great that a company and their employees can be as loyal to their customers as their customers are to them|i am always so pleased with the customer service here for such a tiny starbucks the do a really great job serving the masses that come in there and still manage to take the time to be friendly in the midst of the frenzy outdoor seating in the summer is nice|oprah chai latte great central spot in this out door mall staff was pretty efficient and fast|very friendly local dive bar there is nothing special going on here but friendly folks and cold beer this is exactly the kind of place i like to hang out in|its yet another michaels and its a very good one recommended always for those who love crafting michaels is a godsend|whenever i was at the waterfront i would eat here  the shakes are good as are the shoestring fries and baked beans  the sandwiches are small thin patties of meat so you probably want at least a double  overall pretty tasty|this is smaller store than ones ive seen inside malls but they seem to have all of the necessities they have a great collection of candles my favorites were in the relax section turquoise sky  home sweet home were great im not a huge fan of food scented candles but they actually had very nice ones apple pumpkin was great and surprisingly i loveddddd christmas cookie the employees were all helpful|the food is good and its cheapi mean really inexpensive for a burger and fries add a coke and its like  for two people  seldom if ever crowded service can be a tad slow but hit or missthey also do breakfast and its a great alternative to waiting at eat and parktry the shakes theyre great|i heart steak n shake i love the fact that the fries are shoestring the burgers get to you pretty fast theyre a little greasy and the food is super cheapi visited steak and shake on new years eve in preparation for an evening of mostly tame partying i was unnaturally attracted to their wisconsin buttery burger which is a double patty cheeseburger topped with grilled onions between two buns that have been buttered sounds good rightwell i get this delicious diet abomination and discover that my buns had been dunked in butter the pearly gates of cholesterol laden heaven with the triglyceride angels were singing to me  i took the liberty of increasing my sodium intake by pouring their burgerfries seasoning on the buns and i literally got tears in my eyesmost likely from the salt overload but possibly because this was one of the most evilly decadent things i had eaten in a long timethis is not meant to be a fine dining experience service wasnt fast but it wasnt slow it just kind of was however the waitress did get a point for explaining that the order would take x amount of time to all patrons so i give them a pass for being upfront about itnext trip to pgh is going to feature steak and shake  i guarantee it|fast food in a resturant setting  considering this food is good and cheap plus you can get food to go  must be a reason why this place is always packed|i never thought that id be giving steak n shake a  star review but i really enjoyed my dinner here tonight it just hit the spoti was impressed by our waiter as soon as we walked through the door he apologized for our very brief wait to be seated and for the fact that he was the only waiter working at that time however everything was delivered promptly and he made what wouldve been just a tasty diner dinner into a great experiencei ordered a grilled cheese and fries the grilled cheese was well cooked and filled with tasty perfectly melty cheese i love steak n shakes thin and crispy fries and these were as delicious as i had expectedfor just  for me and my husband i have to admit that we had forgotten how inexpensive steak n shake was based on the cost the food and our fantastic waiter well be back soon|fell asleep last night before i did my review what i can say about this place is their food is good their milkshakes r awesome i had gotten the chicken fingers with fries  a birthday cake milkshake which was delish we got seated pretty fast  our waiter was very polite  professional|as far as im concerned filenes basement is good for two things cheap dresses and cheap accessoriesas a young performer i need goodlooking dresses for frequent auditions  and i need a couple so im not wearing the same thing every time the dresses on the second floor usually range from  and are good for over a year it can be hard to find a fulllength dress thats not reminiscent of a prom dress but their selection of cocktaillength dresses is ampleas far as accessories go filenes tends to have cheap versions of popular trends if i feel the need to stock my wardrobe with a transient fad filenes is the place to go|even when we didnt have a car filenes basement was worth the bus trip to the waterfront i always find something usually i find  things and spend about  and better still i am always still wearing the clothes and shoes  months later i kind of suspect this is the best shopping in pittsburgh its much better than the usual department stores better than marshalls and tj maxx and better than the saks downtown even when it has a sale selection bargains and qualityi like this filenes better than gabriel brothers which are harder to get to gabriel brothers are a real discount shoppers challenge and im afraid i didnt live in pittsburgh long enough to develop the necessary skills    filenes was still up and running in june  when i left town|love this store  dont always have much luck with the sales but i always find something i like here  this isnt your average marshalls or tj max  i think the green dress im wearing is from filenes|this is probably my favorite store in pittsburgh for the selection and variety of discounted designer clothing other stores carry the same stuff but for much much more and its hard to find all the stuff that the basement carries in one spot yes i admit that the burgh has some cool stores i would do most of my clothes shopping here if i were here more often|had a great time at sing sing a while ago with friends  friendly staff  will return|piano man to the tune of gangsters paradisewhat more do i have to say get there early if you want a seat  cover and really fun crowd we had sucha great time and i cant wait to go back|singsing what a blast one of my favorite places to jam on earth cool bar cool town cool people what else do you need the piano players are great funny semigood lookin i mean dude you gotta go  love me some singsing|well the experience did not start well when we walked in the singing we heard was not good oy was it not good thankfully it mostly improved from thereso there were  piano players rotating out on a half hour basis so each was on for an hour and off for half of the  two were really good good singers good piano players and very funny the third guy well not so much piano skills were fine but his singing was not when he sang in his range he wasnt too bad actually but too often he reached for notes that he couldnt get to or forced things that just werent going to happen often his jokes fell completely flat luckily the other two usually did most the talkingthey played a variety of songs as requested by the crowd and would do them in unconventional styles if requested closer by nin as sung by a lounge singer was a highlight we requested britney spears toxic cause we thought it would be funny and so they gave it a shot and as luck would have it it turned out really good that takes some serious talent to pull off if they didnt know it like toxic theyd find it and play it they played a wide variety of stuffpart of the experience is based on the crowd we had a couple larger groups there on a thursday night so smallish group in general that they interacted with a lot providing some running jokes and comedy of course that also meant some annoying drunk people feeling like they could take over half the showmy friends were big fans of the super cheap beer specials  drafts from rock bottom next door the waitress wasnt great but it could have been that she was the only one there and the layout isnt that easy to navigate the bar was generally uncrowded though so getting service there was fastif in the waterfront for a night out definitely a place to hit and have some fun if you are up for some fun and willing to sit through a couple clunkers of songsjokes having a fun loving group of friends to mock things with when they go off the rails a bit will help make it more fun|while we were in pittsburgh for the winter classic on new years day we figured wed see what the area had to offer for nye my wife and i along with my friend and his girlfriend hit up sing sing in homestead its apparently located on what was the site of one of the largest steel mills in the area when it closed they turned the entire site into a large outdoor shopping and entertainment development the only remaining artifacts from what once was were the nine or so original mill smoke stacks still standing at the primary entrance pretty coolsing sing which is a piano bar is attached to the rock bottom brewery and serves a selection of rbbs inhouse brews and shares a similar menu there are no tvs no sports memorabilia which is rare for this city and no big booths for large groups this place is all about being a cabaret with the focus on the musicians mind you this isnt a bad thing just note that if you want a bar go next door or across the street to dave and busters id say sing sing holds about  people seatedthis particular night they were hosting a shocker nyes party for  bucks a person you got a choice of two entrees beef tenderloin tips or lemon chicken veggies mashed potatoes one free drink coupon a midnight champagne toast and what turned out to be over four hours of nonstop music again pretty coolthere were three musicians holding down the fort playing more than just piano drums electric synth bass guitar and apparently i missed the sax there was plenty of crowd involvement as in most piano bars you request songs along with a tip the larger the tip the better chance of hearing your song you have i put three requests on a sheet with a  and managed to get two played their rendition of totos africa was fantastic and surprisingly my curve ball got hit out of the park when one of the guys actually knew the tune and words to the theme from tvs growing pains i was sold from that point oni will take this time to note that this is not a family friendly joint im not sure if it was  only but i certainly wouldnt bring anyone too young to drive a good amount of sexual refrences and strong language awaits youdrinks were stiff and not horribly overpriced i think rail mixed drinks were  and beers were  or so rbb doesnt brew anything i particularly enjoy so i stuck with rum and cokes all and all my bill wasnt scary and im not used to that on dec st waitress staff was really nice and incredibly attentive no complaints there the only down side to everything was group seating as youre sitting at top cab tables it was easily fixed though as the group next to us was up for rearranging tables from side to side to front to back allowing us to talk and share foodbooze etc also being a tourist we had no idea how hard it would be to get a cab in homestead understandably nye has its issues with cab availability but we had to wait  hours for a cab because as we found out homestead is a very suburban community right outside of the city and everyone drives ooopsall and all a good time and someplace id certainly return to if for any reason id be back in pittsburgh as long as i have a car|sing sing is awesome give a buck or more and they will play anything and if they dont know it they will search for who requested the song so they can do something else the person will enjoy  great humor too |what a great time  this place was awesome  i wish i lived right down the road because i could see myself being a regular herehonestly these guys have got some talent like real talent  they can play the piano sing play guitar and the drums  did i mention that they are all pretty hilarious too  id easily pay the  cover to get in here any day because it really is worth it  i am sure i will be back in no time at all  next time i am bringing a big group of friends|had an absolute blast great for any crowd any occasion any age ashley the waitress was amazing|picture billy joels piano man doubled mixed with beer a rowdy crowd and comedy  welcome to sing sing  a unique musical experience found in homesteadif youre looking to grab a bite to eat or a beer come on in  serving food and brews from rock bottom brewery sing sing keeps your tummy full while you listen to two or more amazingly talented pianists take your musical requests  theyll play anything youd like for tips of course  wanting to hear britney spears  toto  duran duran  yep they play that new or oldthe crowd makes the show so make sure you come ready for a good time  if the crowd is dead its harder for the guys to get a reaction  if youre wanting to have some fun it can be a great time  its the perfect place for birthday parties  especially if you want to embarrass a friend  the guys will bring them up to the pianos and perform a little ditty  for being a good sport you get the coveted sing sing bumper sticker  now who wouldnt want thatdueling pianos and brews time to shut up  sing sing|somuchfun i wish i could play a song at the drop of a hat too bad i never took piano lessons and id probably end up mumbling half the lyrics other than the chorus unless its salt n pepas shoop this is a really great place to go when you have out of town guests or are looking for a fun place to take someone for a birthday celebration or a fun night out its just something different to do other than boozing it up at the bars on a saturday night keep in mind youll be paying around a  cover plus whatever drinks and food you get the good thing is the food is coming from the attached rock bottom brewery so a lot of it is restaurant quality good plus the brewery beer is actually pretty good of course you will be paying restaurant price drinksso of course theyre up charged a bit but you do pay for the whole experienceso you gotta get into the spirit with some spirits the guys who play are incredibly talented theres  guys that will take requests and play songs on the piano they pretty much play anything you ask contemporary songs throw back songs fight songs rap songs pop songs you name it they play it my favorite part is when they switch out to another two guys theyll all four get on stage and play two pianos a guitar and drums they usually rock out with some fun familiar songs um journey of course the birthday song is seriously the best they sing to youand call you some nameswith expletives but in a totally nice way of course you just have to go|my friend is a piano teacher so i took it as a good sign that sing sing would be quality stuff it was her birthday and i didnt really know anything about dueling piano bars i was picturing glossy black grand pianos with glittering notes pianists in black jackets and crystal glasses full of red wine i am really really glad i was wrong it was gritty bawdy and quintessentially pittsburgh first off the pianos are scuffed to hell considering the number of tipsy people who sit on them nightly while being mildly humiliated the musicians hammer away at them and theyre covered with n and sing sing stickers its obvious theyve been wellloved the music is anything but the elevator music i was picturing its rock hiphop oldies pop and just about any genre imaginable thanks to the request system send up a piece of paper with some money and the amazing repertoire of the musicians for instance rubber ducky and gangstas paradise were both featured when i was there and both performed impeccably they also honored a request for a taylor swift song only to receive  and a request for anything else which they promptly followed the musicians also do funny versions of popular songs and throw in things like yinz instead of youi saw in awe of the performers for a decent portion of the night it must take a particularly special type of person to put on a show like this considering the energy confidence wit empathy boldness silliness cleverness and sheer talent a job like this requires they rotate performers in and out so theres not even an intermission ive read comments about the baseness of the humor but i had no doubt the guys up on stage were intelligent dudes they had great personalities one was about  pounds cheeky and quickwitted he acted out every sport in the winter olympics and was pretty into this somethingyearold lady in the audience called joan the other had crazy hair and bright blue chucks beatboxed as well as he sang and made it point to play a handful of songs for my friends birthday i think ray charles is the most soulful guy of all time he said when she requested himthere were tons of people celebrating birthdays and one big bachelorette party the saturday night i was there the performers bring the birthday boygirl bachelorbachelorette etc on stage for a  tip which is pretty easy to scrounge up among friends and humiliate the hell out of them ie this is not the place to be if you cant laugh at yourself my friend had a short dress on when she sat on the piano and they sang a threeminute song about her vaginaluckily the show eclipsed the bad service and overpriced weak drinks because those did feature heavily throughout the night the rest of the staff was friendly however and i stumbled on the door guy singing and dancing by himself which made me smilesing sing is definitely not an every weekend type of thing much like hofbruhaus but is a splendid way to celebrate a special occasion definitely belongs on every required pittsburgh experiences list|went for my th birthday and had a blast servers are great the show was hilarious and had the whole crowd involved only bad thing is it can get very expensive|always a good time although its definitely not a place i would visit often its great for groupswhich is quite obvious since there are always several folks there for bachelorette  parties and birthdays shut out to the piano players who can not only play the piano but also sing play the drums and the sax they are funny and know how to keep a crowd entertained also know some pretty obscure songs my big criticism is the set up if you dont have a reservation andor come later in the evening its difficult to get seats believe me i dont mind standing but it does become a bit awkward when you have to keep scooting over to let waitresses and patrons past you if you do find a seat it is often littered with someone elses empty glasses|first time here tonight and i must say i wasnt sure if i wanted to go it seemed like it might be ok but nothing special but i decided to go with friends and man did i have a blast the  door charge was great figuring u had music from  until probably  am  we left shortly after  the food was not super but good prices reasonable the beer left something to b desired as they r a micro brewery so u can only get their crafts i asked for something similar to yeungling but what i got was nothing like it the musicians were great they made this place awesome we will b back and this may b our new pittsburgh hangout|if you want to be wowed by musical talent and want to laugh all night go to sing sing  if you send a dollar up with a song request they will play it if they dont know it they will ask for the person who put the request in so they can sing something else they like or they will look up the lyrics and sing it they aim to please  i have definitely been pleased |what a great time the pianists are funny talented and just a tad crude but just enough to be funny|stopped in at sing sing to have a few drinks and hang out with some friends the entertainment was fun the guys do a great job singing playing the instruments and keeping the crowd pleased sing sing is attached to the rock bottom brewery so they have house beers i did have the sampler and i enjoyed all six beers i sampled what a great place to hang out i highly recommend|i brought my car here in  for repair of a scratched bumper  the damage was minimal but the work required removing my entire bumper for repainting  the staff were very helpful in explaining my options and presenting me with a few choices to get the most bang for my buck  they completed the work in the quoted amount of time and did a great job  a few weeks later i noticed a spot that needed touched up and they handled it immediately and without question  i would definitely recommend these guys if you need bodywork or paint work done|i was so pleased with the quality of customer service at this body shop from the very first time i took my car in for an estimate to a couple months down the line when i got my car repaired they still remembered me one thing i really like is that they always pick up the phone you wouldnt believe how annoying it is when businesses dont do this during normal business hours theyre so personable and gave me an honest quote that i couldnt turn down because it was the lowest in town i checked out  places they just really made this process painless and smooth i believe its a familyrun business and boy does it show in their hospitalityfran and jason were the ones that i worked with  extremely knowledgeable and patient especially with a customer like me who wants to make sure all the paperwork is thorough and calculations are accurate joe diiorios with an i not an l auto body also works closely with enterprise car rental down the street so they came and picked me up those guys down there have a great relationship with this body shop as well and were really accommodatingoverall the quality of their work is amazing i had a large dent on the driver side front bumper and had to replace my light they ended up getting an oem light instead of the aftermarket one because it didnt match and get a brand new bumper they blended the paint for me washed waxed and vacuumed my car and their work has a lifetime guarantee what can i say other than give my highest recommendation and hope other yelpers can find this helpful as this is how i found out about them|from my first phone call to joe diliorios i was impressed every staff member i spoke too was kind and eager to help i was treated like an important client even though my car needed only moderate repairs from a low speed collision i was able to bring my car in right away for an assessment of the damage joe dilorios took care of everything from that point on they dealt directly with my insurance company ordered the parts even getting new parts instead of the used ones my insurance company wrote the estimate for at no cost to me and gave me a call when all the parts came in i then brought my car back to them and they completed the repairs in a timely fashion when i arrived to pick up my vehicle i was pleasantly surprised to see that they had vacuumed washed and waxed my car most importantly the repair work was absolutely top notch they masterfully blended the paint to match older parts with newer repair parts my car looks even better than before the wreckif you dont want any hassle want to be treated with respect and want your car looking fantastic give these guys a calladam|joe dilorios auto body shop was so helpful when i needed to get windows replaced the were able to give me a lower quote then competing auto body shops in the area they were also incredibly friendly and a pleasure to do business with im planning on taking my car here for all future auto needs|this place is amazing i needed my car repaired after an accident and the guys here were so helpful they set me up with a rental car as soon as i dropped my car off repaired my car in a timely manner detailed it for free and their customer service was unbelievable i cant recommend this place more|im grateful to my insurance company for recommending di iorios auto body shop after an accident i needed some body work done as soon as possible the other recommended shops wouldnt even make an appointment to see me for days these guys fit me in that afternoon and coordinated the rental too everyone i worked with was courteous and pleasant and the work was done more quickly than expected moreover they found ways to help save on the expense the car came out looking better than before the accident  a few days later i noticed they had buffed out some scratches that werent even part of the repair area i will definitely be back next time i need auto repairs|went here for the first time this past weekend needless to say ill be returning it was a blastit was cheap to get in and since we got there a bit earlier we got a semigood table though it was very annoying that people had reserved tables right up front and never showed up what is wrong with these people everything if you ask me seriously though if youre going to reserve a table you better freaking go i had no complaints about the place itself the guys were hilarious and watching my brother get made fun of multiple times was just the cherry on top anddd this has to be the only place ive ever enjoyed being around people who were sloppy drunk because the comedians take no prisoners i did enjoy when matt and joey were the ones up there because they are just amazing and make it so much better they are great at what they do cant wait to go back|so lucky to be referred to joe diiorios after moving to pittsburgh its really invaluable to have car guys that you trust i could detail several experiences here in comparison to other chain shops but suffice it to say that theyve always been honest helpful and fair|you can find pretty good body work without too much trouble  finding a place thats friendly prompt and organized that also does good body work is more difficult  joe dilorios delivers on all counts  highly recommended for the next time you  or somebody else  make a little mistake on the road|amazing repair service i hit a really fat raccoon in the appalachians it was dark and rainy and i didnt see the poor thing until it was too late while going fairly fast down a hill the raccoon destroyed my front bumper the grill and my right fog light thankfully i had duct tape in my trunk anyway once i got back to pittsburgh i called my insurance agentmy insurance referred me to diiorios and im really glad they did the staff was very friendly and helpful doing the estimate they even set up a rental for me when i was having the car repaired they kept me updated on the status of the car and were just really pleasant to work with the whole timehopefully i dont have to get any body work done on my car again anytime soon but if i do i know im going to take back to diiorios|waterfront lowes beats monroeville lowes for lawn and garden  hate to admit it but its true|lowes is my goto store for home improvement supplies its convenient and local to me customer service is always great and prices are fair my most recent experience with customer service was amazing so a hose burst on my hot tub call repair guy or try to fix it myself i gave it a go took pictures of the hose and fitting and headed to the plumbing section i showed the gentleman the picture and asked for help he didnt have exactly the fitting for a hot tub but gave me what he thought would work it did under  bucks later and all was a go winter came and it sprung a leak in same spot my fault and maybe lack of strength to tighten fitting and frigid temps back to plumbing section same gentleman gave me the advice again and bam fixed this is what i want in customer service sadly i cannot remember his name bad customer on my part thank you|lowes is my first stop for all of my home projects   i am currently redoing door  lowes has knowledgeable employees that offer advice to the diys as well as a stable of contractors to hire out the big jobs   returns are handled seamlessly  who doesnt grab the wrong part  their garden section is great for spring planting  they have competatively priced appliances   off with lowes credit card is also nice  having those large items delivered is a convenience their best asset is the expertise of the staff  i frequently change mind on an original concept based on their input   highly recommended|the food here can actually be a little hit and miss but i love the grilled cheese club with fries i get it way too much people make fun of methey have a ten dollar minimum for credit cards fyi|excellent wings and sandwiches generally good food otherwise and fair prices nice casual place the service can be a little slow due to how popular the place gets at peak times|great atmosphere and even better peoplewait staff was very friendly and the french onion soup was amazingdefinetly recommend the home made chipsgreat bar in the up and coming homestead areahighly recommend|were always looking for nonchain restaurants by the waterfront they do exist and this has become a favorite ive had the hot roast beef  fries and the corned beef on rye and both were delicious every beer ive had here has been ice cold and the service has been strong too its a great place to watch a pirates game too|awesome wings and pubgrub great beer selection and fun bartenders|dukethe owneris the man  hes a true pittsburgher and he loves everyone from pittsburgh  he looks like hell beat you up but hes a softy with a big heart  look for the bald guy with the raspy voice and make friendshell hook you up  hes also totally into the development of other pittsburgh businesses and he hosts events for local startups  ask him for a tour of the old eat n park next doori believe his intention is still to turn it into an incubator of sorts  fortunately the bar is close enough to the waterfront that its just far enough out of the ghettothe crowd is certainly decent  definitely have some beers on the porch in the summerespecially in the rain lower level is covered  very relaxing atmosphere  i wish my company was located in the area so we could frequent dukes more steadily were on the north side  still worth the drive to feel at home have a good bite and some cold beers|food is good here great beer selection on tap sometimes the beer is on the pricey side what i want from a neighborhood bar is a neighborhood special pinkerton is one of the best sandwiches good place to watch football hockey baseball|one of my favorite local eateries the mild  wild sauce is my absolute favorite i wish i could purchase it i am not a big bar food junkie but the tomlin sandwich is great  reminds me of a fatheads sandwich food portion is great the only complaint i would have if any is the craft beer is a little on the pricey side as usual in most local bars friendly service will continue to frequent with my family|we recently ordered fish sandwiches from here they were huge we did get the large but it was so big we couldve just shared one was not over fried the french fries were hot and also very good we will definitely be going again to try something different|went to dukes last week they have really renovated the place and added a lot of large screen tvs the best part tho is the vast improvement in draft beer selection i counted  beers on tap if you are a beer head and are at the waterfront shopping are this is definitely one of your best choices  the food is above average and the selection is common pub fare|if you want to know the people from homesteadmunhall then dukes is the place for you  a locals favorite theyve seen a lot of growth since i started going  years ago   they have a great selection of beer but i think where they really shine is in the food department  my favorite sandwich there is the pinkerton and its often hard to get anything else every time i go  pierogi pizza is pretty good as well as there gigantic sampler platter that a party of  could eat together  dukes is also an awesome place to watch sporting events with their see it from any angle tv selections all around the bar  soups of the days are awesome potato soup yes please and they have a excellent happy hour special that will save you a few dollars  ive always been treated with a welcoming vibe from the staff and i dont have any complaints|i find it frustrating to read bad reviews about great bars and restaurants that are based on almost nothing i eat and drink here about once a month and everything is great i have eaten here around  times and never had a bad meal great draft and great service this is the best bar in this area|love dukes and love the food i wish i could figure out the closing times or i wouldnt plan so many after work gatherings their food is amazing never had a bad meal and their prices are standard for crafts and actually pretty cheap for domestic|i really dont see how anyone could give this place a bad review  the food is fantastic and if its not my belly luring me in then its the awesome beer selection they have  my suggestion for those who are leery to try dukes after reading other ridiculous reviews is just order what they have on special that night everything is good so you cant go wrong and it will most likely come out faster and hotter being that its on special  if not i could suggest other delicious things to eat but i dont feel like typing out the entire menuthey often switch the beers out so there is always a constant flow of different and unique craft beers on tap they can also print you out a list of beers and their percentage so you know what you are in for lolanyhow i love this place the owners and the staff i highly suggest it to everyone who likes good beer and good food|my boys and i stopped here for dinner one night it was cold and dreary outside but warm and homey in here  our server was extremely nice the menu had lots of options they are kind of known for their potato soup so thats what i had it is very good its a very thick soup that is velvety smooth i would definitely order it again it was perfect for a rainy night my youngest son had chicken tenders they looked a little over cooked but i tasted one and it was good the coating was crispy and the chicken was juicy my older son ordered wings with their house made sauce it was good but not spicy enough for him i thought it was good and would order it the next time i go|great place for a birthday party  a family gathering  a work retirement party  or even a doubledatea combination watering hole great place to eat and great entertainment for adults adult gamesthe homestead pittsburgh location of dave  busters is just one of the almost  locations across the country  from new york to florida to california   from canada to mexico  the dave  busters idea was conceived in little rock arkansas back in the s two different businesses one a popular watering hole  one a game  entertainment business were right next door to each other the two young owners were friends and quickly realized that combining their businesses made perfect sense so they opened the first combined d  b in      no not little rock but dallas to this day there are no d  bs in little rock not sure what is up with that but lots of other cities have been the beneficiaries of these two friends combining their businessesthe one in pittsburgh is the only one i have ever been to  when i lived there a group of friends and coworkers and me of courseused to go there for happy hour  power hour     at least once a week we had a blast  a great place to kickback and let the worries of the work day melt awaywonder if theyll ever open one in marin county ca shucks  probably not not a marin county scene for sure what a blast it was though i miss going to d  b they have all the classics like billiards  shuffleboard plus over  interactive  video games a rechargable power card provides an easy way to access all the games  power hour is game happy hour   an entire hour of classic and video games for just  ten bucks  a great bar wonderful food and service a relaxing and fun way to spend a friday or saturday evening youll never want to leave meet your friends here grab a beer and a burger or steak and hit the games time will just evaporate     while you laugh and drink with your favorite girl your best friend or even your boss  dave  busters lots of parking lots of funfun fun fun fun fun fun     bring on the beer|i love the games here but cant go very often since they dont rotate new games in very often  the place is usually pretty cleanpool tables often have a wait on the weekend but are some of the better ones youll find in the cityfood is just ok drink prices are fair but not great|the usual fun centeryou can play games using a play card which you purchase there  game prices can be confusing       credits etcthe arcade can be fun if you bring some friends  almost every game is a ticket game and there are few innovative or exciting game choicesi didnt eat there so i cant rate the restaurant part of dave and busters|we came here on a saturday night and luckily it wasnt as packed as i thought it would be i love playing ticket games so luckily there were a lot of games to chose from and not many video games sorry video game lovers we only played  worth of games and surprisingly we were there for awhile i love their new wheel of fortune game on our first play we ended up winning a little over  tickets they also have fruit ninja as a game it was fun with the big widescreen but unfortunately you dont win as many tickets as you would hope i wish their ticket center would have individual ticket counters like the other dbs ive been to where you feed a counting machine your tickets at this place they just weigh your tickets and give you the final count we didnt try the food here and instead went to pf changs to eat before coming here but the eat  play deal looked fun too bad it was only restricted to certain times of the day overall i had a blast here and definitely would come back hopefully next time when there is a deal or promotion|i love dave and busters  it is a great place to go when you are wanting to have a great time with a great group of friends  if you find you and your friends bored on a friday or saturday night come to db and win some prizes  it is pricey though so bring some major moolah|dave and busters is the best place to eat and play games there is many fun games and prizes to win i highly suggest if you want to plays games go wednesday when all the games are half off food is pretty good and a nice bar the downside is that the booze is pretty pricey|not a cheap night out you will end up spending money here  but it is busy fun entertaining and a good time out  i ate dinner here and the food was great i also played pool and the arcade games|my friend and i both had friday off so we decided we wanted to do something more interesting than just hit up a bar on thursday night we settled on dave and busters i went on facebook and printed off a coupon for buy  get  in play free we split the card it took us about  hours to get throughthe games werent quite as fun as i remembered but it was still a good time the place was far from crowded and when a machine was out of tickets it took us a good deal of time to find someone to assist us when we did the team at db could not have been more accommodating to apologize for our wait they swiped us in for several games as well as gave us a handful of tokens for the game we were playing i think a lot of companies im looking at you american airlines could learn a lot from db it cost them virtually nothing to swipe us in for games but it made our experience so much betterdrinks are halfprice after  or  my tropical mojito was awesome my friend and i are definitely planning on going back on a wednesday for halfprice games and halfprice drinks|visiting from toronto i was really impressed the amount of tickets to be won was incredible we usually got  tickets per play on average compared to playdium here thats awesome considering id win at most  tickets with the smallest prize costing  tickets the food is great the place is clean and the games dont feel greasy or nasty from all the food|i love it  love it|dave  busters is a great experience  if you set your expectations realistically and carefully choose when you attendthe main squeeze and i always  use a survey receipt for buy  get  in free gameplay or  attend on a wednesday during the day flexible work schedules wed never dream of eating there because we like healthy yuppie food and we only drink cheap drafts or drink cocktails during happy houryour visit is largely determined by time of day expectations and whether or not you eat their food if you come on a friday night the lines will be long youll pay  for the two of you to eat drink and play for  hours and youll be left with a very sour taste in your mouththe staff is really excellent any issue with a game not paying out tickets results in immediate help and extra tickets or a swipe for a different game from an employee note the drinks are weak reviews also notice it was people buying shots and ordering multiple drinks per person thats typical white trash behavior bartenders here are savvy they mirror the behavior of the guests all of our drinks have been consistently strong and well put together because were courteous and tip well i have witnessed bartenders bypass tattooed loud guests and address me and take my order first this is rational logical behavior also note the prize center games suck comments youre supposed to stack tickets over multiple visits and use them on a big prize like life delaying gratification nets you bigger returns every other visit ive seen someone walk out with a video game system wii xbox and even a few xbox ones the thing about dave  busters is the crowd changes depending on day of week and time of day sunday afternoon its all families and friday and saturday night its all drunk  somethings the atmosphere changes and thats why the reviews are all over the placethis review is based on ish months of monthly visits most visits are  stars some are  starsusing survey receipts for buy ten get ten avoiding wednesday friday or saturday evenings and sunday afternoon families and avoiding the food entirely and drinking cheaply youll have a great experience for personi really enjoy the staff too they split the difference between fun and professional special shout out to riley gave us info on possibly hosting a party there|there is good food but a great spot to enjoy a few drinks  watch sports on the big screens its great for adult fun after pm great for a first date if you like to have a good fun  feel relaxed|i still love this place  i spent my th birthday at dbs and it was a wise decision  i had so much fun and so did my guest  i got a very attentive serving staff and met up with many helpful servers  i believe that service has improved so i bumped this restuarant up to  stars  no five stars yet because ive still as of yet to eat in the restuarant portion of it  its still worth the visit and is a lot of fun for a reasonable price|ill have a biased opinion of any place like this what could be wrong with playing old and new school games drinking and eating all at the same place the one thing i can think of is the price on the surface this is a pretty expensive place however they give a bunch of good deals depending on the time you go whether or not you donate money to the makeawish foundation and if youre lucky when you take a spin on the wheel of prizes but honestly know what the deals are before you go to make sure to get the best price available in regards to the games theres a plethora for your enjoyment although it is nice to play games that spit out tickets the last couple of times ive gone ive gotten  hours of arcade games for a very cheap price mario kart anyone either way its a really fun place that youll most certainly have a good time at|first off let me say that i find the people who usually work at dave and busters usually dont care or seem to be angry and hate their job a friend and i went here and found that a couple of the machines ran out tickets and someone was always there and happy to help the staff went out of their way to make sure we had a good time the manager tony was very sweet and made sure everything was ok every staff member we talked to was extremely nice this is by far the best dave and busters ive had been to|this is a really fun way to spend an afternoon after several visits here ive found a couple games that are easy to win and score you lots of tickets and others that are just a blast to play we did really awesome last time we were here and their prize room is full of some pretty neat stuff their food is not too bad ive only ever eaten here once and it wasnt that memorable but i didnt hate it i did like that they have a bar and they had my favorite beer on tap that was nice like pretty much any arcade ive ever been to there are things that are a rip off and occasionally something wont work properly that really irritates some people but i figure no arcade is perfect at least none that ive ever been to the most irritating thing for me is that some of the games have a call button on them that signals an employee to come assist you and i kept hitting the button with my leg or something so every once in awhile someone would randomly appear at my side and ask if i needed help and i would be really confused haha we went here with my husbands family on thanksgiving and we had a total blast the whole place was pretty empty and i felt really bad for the employees that had to work that day but it was nice for us|chilling with

flowing  delicious everybody is happy  nice bash kiss fm|after having a few less than memorable trips to db in years past my wife and i  decided to go back for a pittsburgh happy hour anniversary party this past thursday  pgh happy hour is a facebook group of friends that like to check out new watering holes every thursday and its run by a guy that seems to party  while still holding down a very lucrative full time job  anyway pgh hh was celebrating an anniversary and chose db for the location  the db staff set up the back pool room with complimentary  enormous spread of appetizers with dips and kept refilling them when they got low  our server carla was very attentive and friendly making sure we were aware of the specials and checking back often when our glasses got to the half way point  the other server back there was working equally as hard but i never got the chance to get her name  i had been here one other time for an organized happy hour for a past employer and remember very similar service but i never got the chance to give them any credit  i think db is an awesome place when you need some space for your next event|ive probably only been to  dave  busters in my life but this is probably my favorite one its a lot bigger and has more variety of games than the other  ive been to though they pretty much have the same games the prizes are also better here and the ticket exchange rate for the prizes seemed a lot more fair too definitely take advantage of the half priced games on wednesdaysi dont come for the food since its very average with all these good restaurants close by why dont just eat somewhere else and come for the games|i always go there to either eat dinner or have drinks never had a problem with the food or drinksometimes i will play games there sometimesthe girls behind the counter are very nice even the one guy brett is also nicehe works very hard from what i can see as well as the girls that work there  even the one girl behind the counter was dressed very nicewhen i do go there they do know what i like to eat or drink although the restrooms should be cleaned a little more|great games and prizes amazing foodgreat way to enjoy your day with your family super busy place|im a fani went to this one october  i was in town for my favorite nfl team the colts steelers game i went to the game and had fun in the cityi went on half off wednesday i really had fun with the games im a young man and i like old nintendo games i like all kinds of games the skee ball game acted upi had funi will go back not to this one because of the miles to far i will go to the ohio oneim a fan|we had our reunion banquet last weekend at this db it was the highlight of our gathering the room was spacious wellappointed with tables covered with black tablecloths and set up according to our specifications the buffet was delicious the manager servers and bartender were enthusiastic and attentive what a wonderful facilitykids and adults loved the arcade games the pool tables were a hit too we appreciated the roomy dance floor for those who wanted to groovein the months leading up to our event special events representative laura checked in regularly she sean and the managers made sure that our experience was memorable and even added extra touches that made us feel special thank you db for a great experience|i gave db  stars because our waiter was very geniune and nice the place has definitely changed over the years becoming a very pricey venue the food was mediocre the fries were cold and the sliders were subpar almost like white castles from the freezer section in most grocery stores my buffalo wings were rather tough as for the games they were mostly the same but included a lot of the newer app style games like flappy bird skeeball and free throw were still fun along with the coin drop machines but wow we went through  of games really fast the gift section is full of fun tchotchkes and prizes if you pay enough to rack up the points nevertheless it is still a great destination to celebrate any special occasion with family friends or coworkers|this is a high qualityclean and professional grooming shop i feel very comfortable leaving my golden retriever with this groomer  the focus is on clean and natural and not fancy perfumes and gimmicks|the woman working who cut my  month old schnauzer was wonderful he was very matted not to mention nervous for his first grooming and she still managed to do a wonderful job on him i could not be happier especially because the people at petco claimed he needed to be completely shaven because they didnt have the time for it being it was a busy saturday paws in the family pet grooming actually cared and took the time with him and he because of that he got to keep his beard his chestfur and the fur on his legs he looks like a schnauzer i am so happy|great job always i highly recommend mandy  randy |fresh and goodbut i was starving  i will obviously be returning since i have such a favorable memory  i must say though my spicy chicken sandwich was freshoutofthefryer hot and very crispy while my bun was toasted  the french fries were also fried to an artery clogging perfection|ordered pizza and wings from here with delivery  the pizza was pretty decent but the wings were just soso  the prices were pretty good and delivery was quick  ill definitely order pizza from here again|i am a big fan of rock bottomthere are several dishes that are moneyappetizer  seared ahi spinach artichoke dipentree       fire steak pub tips or chicken fried chickendesert       carrot cake to die forbar food     pizza or ball park pretzels  both of which are sprayed with brown ale  half the menu is really good the other half is great  the beer is good  ask for the sampler  they usually have a velvet and something on cask  ask for one of those if you are looking for something different  they will also have a scotch ale an ipa whiskey stout or other specialty depending on the mood of the brewer which if its still matt the mood is grumpy   if andy is still working there he is sure to please and molly is great in the cocktail areahead over to sing sing after dinner and its a wrapi used to work there several years ago and i make it a point to hit every rb i possibly candont go to the one in charlotte though its not really a rock bottom|nobody has reviewed this in a while but i am surprised at the lack of lovin  my husband and i ate here a few nights ago and we liked it a lotwe started with drinkshe got the housebrewed portland wheat and said it was quite a good beer and i got a mixed drink red rock that was also tasty  he got a burger covered in mozzarella cheese and i got a mahi sandwich  both greatthe fries and side salads are good here too and there is no skimping on portions of anything  there were tons of things on the menu that im looking forward to tryingwe are usually not dessert people at all but ended the meal sharing a triple chocolate stout cheesecakewho can resist a beer cheesecake come onour food and service was great  they had the penguins game on all the tvs in the bar and were setting up live music for after the game  seriously whats not to like  im thinking this place has changed for the better since the last review a year ago |this is literally the first place i went when i first came to pittsburgh  and i loved it hearty fullsized meals lots to choose from and not too crowded or noisy although for the sake of full disclosure i didnt sit at the bar and i dont drink alcohol so i cant comment on that i go back to pittsburgh often and rock bottom ends up being a good standby for a dinner and a movie kind of night really i have no complaints about this place so im surprised by the few low ratings here|pretty good excellent beer sampler  bargain  veggie burger awesome onion rings awesome fried mac n cheese was delicious  crunchy on the outside creamy on the inside carrot cake was monstrously huge and delicious|first off i will say that i just moved here from california and was a big patron at the rockbottom in long beach i came to the homestead location last night eager to see the beer at this locationnow rockbottom is a chain brewery so a lot was the same the menu the food prices yet beer is cheaper and i am fine with that i have always found their food to be pricey but they use excellent ingredients and it has always been tasty and filling so i am fine with that the food here was just as good as the long beach location so i have no problem with the chef at allservice was good our waitress was very friendly and helpful i wish that they had asked us if we wanted to sit in the bar since happy hour was still going but that isnt a big thing went to the bar to get a drink and had to wait awhile to get the bartenders attention but he was very friendly and i got a nice welcome from him and others at the bar when they learned i had just moved here i really enjoyed thatbeer we got the beer sampler to try the whole list and well i found the dark beers a bit lacking in comparison the light beer and the wheat were amazing very impressed the pale was ok as was the velvet pale that was one of the specials of the night but both were way too citrusy the uppity ipa was very good i dont usually like ipas because the hops overpowers all flavor but the brewer had a good balance still couldnt do a whole glass i felt the imperial stout had a bitter burned taste that was overpowering i almost want to say the batch had too much chocolate malt in it not ice cream malt for the nonhomebrewers the brown and amber were decent but bland i ended up getting an actual glass of the light beer and was able to finish it all without forcing it one point up on long beach who had a good light but the aftertaste got to you before the glass was emptyi really wanted to try the das gut dopplebock but they were out looks like they will have it in bottles to go soon so i hope i can catch that also want to try the snow moon belgianverdict while i was not too impressed with the dark beers i found the lighter ones very good and i look forward to trying the other seasonal beers it is a good hour drive south to get there so i wont be going too often but i will be back|beer selection was good but they were out of the ones we wanted  of the  people in our group ordered steaks all of them were cooked to their satisfaction the bourbanzola was a good addition defiantly a place i would go again joe our server was awesome and super friendly|i love this place  great atmosphere and friendly service every time i go|weve all had this happen to us  you go past a place one hundred times and never go on then once you finally do you realize how many opportunities you wastedrock bottom is definitely a solid bar as a microbrewery their beer list is full of house brews there are better beers in the world but there are a lot of worse beers out there too what really makes rock bottom standout though is the food my girlfriend and i shared an order of nachos and it took everything we had to finish them they also make a mean soft pretzel the waterfront may not be the most convenient thing to do while in pittsburgh but no trip to the waterfront is complete without a bite and a drink at rock bottom|rock bottom is a nice hangout place often when you are out and about with friends you arrive home with no voice from screaming over all of the background noise great if your out to see a band but not so much fun if you actually want to talk to the people sitting around you depending on your mood you can sit in the dining area full of booths and tables its alittle separated from the main bar area so provides for a semi quiet dining area the bar area gives you a choice of sitting at the surrounding tables with waitress service or hanging out at the bar itself complete with a chillie ice strip to keep those yummy brews cold and the ever entertaining company of your favorite bartender when the weather cooperates the outdoor patio houses about  tables for outdoor dining the view howevernot so picturesque just the entrance to the improv which hey that could be the perfect seat if youre stocking the local comics the bar area contains pools tables and dart boards to try your skills on any give night sports fans can enjoy the games of the day on one of the  big screen tvs surrounding the bar area the menu is pretty decent with burgers that are cooked to order with the choice of either steak  veggie or chicken they have a number of specialty burgers with different cheeses toppings and creative themes the bourbonzolla is a tasty burger with a bourbon based glaze and gorgonzola cheese appetizers which range from nachos to firecracker shrimp steaks pasta and salads with rotating specials from different areas of the menu on monday the burgers are half offi dont think you have to be a member of their mug club to get the special however if you are here regularly the mug club is great with free gifts and specials httpwwwrockbottomcommc needless to say i have a fun beer glass collection thanks to rock bottomlol now everyone favorite part about rock bottoms beers the in house brew master keeps it interesting with a rotating variety of frothy yummy to try along with the consistant favorites of ale ipas rotating darks and kolsch stop by on thursday nights for a colorful game of trivia where teams battle it out in a game of intelligence and drinking skills|rock bottom on thursday nights is the place to be team trivia starts at pm and it is free to play the dj todd is great the food is good but the ball park pretzels with spicy spinach cheese dip is the best the wait staff is generally pleasant and on top of things a few servers are excellent i am not a beer drinking so i havent tried the microbrews but the mixed drinks ive had have been good and a few of thier specials perfect on nights that are not trivia nights rock bottom is quiet and a good place for a small to medium party larger parties will usually be split into two tables overall an enjoyable place at which i am a regular|i would have to say im pretty partial to rock bottom i have been going almost every thursday for the past  years because of the fantastic team trivia my friends and i love the atmosphere the dj todd and the service that we get at rock bottom every week when we go a menu is never needed because we pretty much know everything we want on it except for when the change the menu from time to time and we get to have a special treat with something new as an avid rock bottomer hands down i have never in my life had a better spicy spinach cheese dip than i have had here at rock bottom whether i have eaten dinner or not before i come down to the restaurant my favorite and my food of choice is the enormous ball park pretzels with the cheese dip it is a meal itself the mixture of onions cheese spinach and tomatoes is perfection another favorite of mine is the barbecue chicken pizza it has a great kick to it and its big enough for two people the service has always been super great and now since we go often we have developed a great relationship with some of the wait staff a truly great place to have fun with friends and meet new people come to team trivia every thursday at pm|the beer is good their light beer lumpy dog is very good doesnt taste like a light beer when i was pregnant i became quite a fan of their root beer floats tooas others have noted the pretzels are really good im not a fan of the spinach dip but my husband likes it veggie burgers are always good too though the staff sometimes seems confused when you order say the bourbonzola burger with a veggie burger long long ago when i used to go to the rock bottom in boston there was a hot mushroom  sundried tomato  cheese dip on the menu that was fantastic if they resurrect that i will gladly add another star|so i have not been to one of these in awhile since i normally have an aversion to chain restaurants but since i was with colleagues on travel for work and they chose this place i went along first surprise decent beer  i remembered the normal rb brewery beers were not much to write home about but they had a couple of new styles including a very good imperial ipa that for glass cannot be beat  second surprise pretty tasty food with a lot more healthy options than i expected  recommend the summer salad and the ahi tuna  both were great service was a little slow not sure why so a star review is downgraded to  ill be back next time im in pittsburgh for work|ive always been pleasantly surprised with the food ive gotten at rock bottom  i say surprised because with any restaurant that falls into the slippery territory of a chain you expect to find your fair share of culinary duds  but ive really had a lot of good meals at rock bottom  now granted you do owe it to yourself when ordering to not forget where you are a barstraunt if you will and dont get anything above and beyond this places call of duty  for instance i will never be ordering the ahi tuna  ill leave that to my favorite sushi bars and restaurants a bit closer to the water the mon doesnt countbut besides that i always really enjoy my meal choices  ive recently gotten the chicken avocado sandwich  chicken was grilled perfectly plenty of avocado and it was a good sized sandwich without being excessive  ive also ordered the margherita pizza which could definitely be split between two people  its an eight cut that comes to you on a big wooden pizza paddle  the pizza was really great  the crust was crispy it had a good balance of cheese and tomatoes and the basil pesto was fresh and tasty  and not greasy whatsoever  big bonus points there  but my biggest surprise as of late was when i ordered their chicken flautas  im a huge mexican food fan and always hesitate to order mexican outside of a mexican restaurant for fear of being disappointed  but i had an insatiable craving one night and decided to go for it  it was delicious  the flautas are deep fried which gives you an amazing crunch and they still managed to not dry out the inner ingredients  the accompanying rice was nice and moist as well  i was so happyive always been quite happy with the service there as well  i go on thursday evenings for trivia and nine times out of ten the service is really spot on  the ladies servicing the bar area are friendly and attentive  only once or twice to my memory has my service been subpar and that can usually be chalked up to an extremely packed trivia night with only two visible servers helping  peoplei definitely give rock bottom two thumbs up for taking your typical chainfound food and making it fresh yummy and worth coming back for more|happy hour at rock bottom  thumbs up  good prices the pizza is delicious drinks are a few dollars off the regular price good service and the atmosphere is always casual and fun|rock bottom was our first stop on a  mile pub crawl  as expected the bar was lively the food was good and the service was accommodating  the beers are better than church brew works and the bar was populated  the bartender readily offered a taste of beer and gave us a hat to wear for the rest of the crawl  i vote for rock bottom as the anchor store of the water works|i havent been to rock bottom in years  maybe even decadesis that even possible  well either way its been awhile  so with my gift certificate i took my brother out for a birthday dinner  as i get older my tolerance for things like crowds and youngsters gets lower and lower  as a result i told my brother to be ready by pm so we could head to the waterfront before everyone goes out for date night  plus the pirates were playing at  so we could enjoy our beers and the gamewhen we arrived the bar side was already pretty packed but we were still able to get a table  our server was very attentive friendly and helpful  right off the bat we both ordered samplers so we could try all of their beers  we loved the fact that as she approached our table with a full tray of samples our server said i have to go back for the rest  in all we were served  different beers each in  oz glasses maybe   i can never tell  i gotta say rock bottom knows their beer  i liked more than i didnt and very few were not to my liking  so the   beer sampler was well worth it  during our sampling we indulged on some southwest egg rolls  they were okay but not quite what i expected  the spicy ranch was top notch though  as we ran out of beer we each ordered up a kobe burger  they were both cooked exactly to our liking medium  and to top off our wonderful evening the pirates brought home a winmy only complaint as a beer drinker is the cost for a growler  the glass container itself is sold for   thats the empty price  to me thats a little ridiculous when east end only charges  for the bottle and penn brewery   paying more for the bottle than the beer inside seems like insanity to me  so i walked out empty handed    but it wont deter me from returning|fish tacos were excellent great brewed beers on tap as well|i very much enjoyed my first visit here i got the turkey meatloaf and it was really tasty its more sausage than turkey the cheesy mashed potatoes were excellent the star of the night was the appetizer the artichoke and crab dip it was awesome my only complaint was i ordered a red ale and they were out i had the curmudgeon instead and it was very good but still|first time i was here i had chicken quesadillas and they were bad  we went again last weekend i had the chicken avacod sandwich  it was very good  no fat in the chicken  just a mess to eat but still awesome   also had the chocolate stout cupcake it was amazing|thanks to the staff herefor being so friendly andcool with our whole messrock bottom allowed our bachelorette party to eat and drink and hang after dave and busters orphaned us|went to rock bottom for lunch the other day and was very pleased my coworker had printed out a coupon for a free mini appetizer the waitress told us that they were not making mini appetizers and gave us a full sized chicken quesadilla if you have ever had the southwestern egg rolls from chilis  the filling tasted like that and i am a big fan mondays are half off burger days and i tried the just hot enough burger  topped with crispy jalapenos pepper jack cheese pico de gallo and housemade habanero ketchup it was delish the ketchup was so good and the fries were extremely crispy the prices are a little steep for lunch but if you go on monday its totally worth it i think that the quality of food more than makes up for it but dont expect for pay under  for a sit down i felt that the staff was very nice and the waitress was very attentive the service was quick and i think you can get in and out in under an hour|mostly come here for the beer and sports fun place|i go to rock bottom pretty often for dinner or their awesome beer so i was really really excited to have my bridal shower there  my maid of honor reserved the banquet room which was very nice and separated from the rest of the restaurant  my moh and mother said that the person they talked to about reservations and arrangements was wonderful and easy to get in touch with  my shower was wonderful the wait staff was great and kept everyones glasses full  it started pouring down rain and they let us stay a little longer so my gifts wouldnt get wet when taking them out to the car  the only reason this place gets  stars is because we were not allowed to take our leftover food from the buffet home  there was salmon chicken potatoes and mac and cheese left over and they told us we couldnt box it up  not sure why they cant reserve it  it would have just gone to wastealso not at all related to the shower their trivia night is super fun|southwest egg rolls and fish tacos mmmmmmmmm ohh and the amazing brews|im giving  stars mostly because of the beerlarge selection  decent prices   the food is pretty good but nothing to rave about  the menu has a good variety and everything ive tried has been good  portions are large  one side of the restaurant is the bar  bar atmospherewith several tvs   pool tables  its very wide open with extremely high ceilings  the other side is more for families or people who arent concerned about watching sports  in general it has a relaxed atmosphere  ive always had quick  friendly service  i love the whole waterfront areaso much to do|im not much of a beer drinker but my fiancee is a major enthusiast so i agreed to tag along  im glad i did  our waitress was very knowledgeable about the extensive housebrewed beer selection and helped me to pick one i would love the kolsch was very crisp light and drinkable  the food was standard pub fare with a twist wellexecuted  my burger was topped with onion petals and gorgonzola and cooked to perfection  the waitress recommended their macaroni and cheese for a side which was definitely a good choice  my only complaint is that most of the food was rather heavy and i spent the rest of the night wallowing on the couch  not sure i would make the hour trip to pittsburgh again but if i found myself in the city i may just stop by|im a regular here since their kitchen is open late and its a good option after movies their nachos is pretty good i also tried their burger and chicken sandwiches and theyre good as well i think the only thing i didt like is the steak taco appetizer it was too sour and kinda tasteless|the cajun pasta i ordered was just spicy enough to keep me sipping my rock bottom ipa it may be a chain but i always get that microbrew restaurant feel when im here they could upgrade the quality of the servers but ive never had a really bad experience with the service|i really miss the northstar amber but the specialty beers are always good  food is excellent and the service staff is friendly|another good meal  this time the housemade meatloaf its a blend of turkey and sausage instead of the standard ground beef a refreshing and delicious twist on a comfort food staple served over cheddar mashed and mixed veggies the server could have behaved like she wanted to be there but everyone has a bad day once in awhile service was prompt just the same overall good experience|my husband and i got here a couple times a year    always except my veggies today get great food at a decent price   i love their side salad which has raisins and sunflower seeds    burgers are great and my husband loves their chicken mac and cheese   recommend to everyone just get there early for a seat|i have to say that ive only been here when it was very busy i found the service fairly quick and any of the food ive had has been delicious i went there tonight and there was an issue with my food without going into detail i will say they handled it wonderfully our waitress mallory was very kind and she was quick to fix the problem i had the salmon for the second time and it was just as amazing as it was the first time i had one beer thats similar to a blue moon and that was good too i would go back again|planned a surprise birthday party here for my wife and they did an amazing job helping to pull it off service was extremely helpful professional and on point all night lauren one of the managers was reliable and pleasant throughout the entire planning process if anyone is looking to plan an event i would highly recommend rock bottom couldnt be happier|on a glorious day in the month of may  my love and i stumbled hungrily into rock bottom  ha just kidding i realized darren w hadnt reviewed here so i had to start it cheesy  the rock bottom line monday for lunch we had awesome service by ashley  we werent rushed and it was quite  the burgers were great and half off  the beer was very good  we will be returning for sure|i love this place great food and the best beer brewed on site the bourbonzola burger is the best thing you can order here|i love this restaraunt rarely have i ever received service like i get here the food is good definitely reasonable for the price the thing that blew me away was the fact that my steak was cooked to temperature this rarely ever happens at restaraunt of similar price range and quality but the servers are fantastic very attentive polite and timely the beer selection is awesome we always order the sampler i like having lots of options as far as beverages go the wait time isnt terrible if you go a little later on a friday or saturday night and they most often call you before the quotes time the desert menu is a little small but i could probably skip it anyways   the ambiance is good not to crammed or noisy they also have outside seating available when the weather is nice i highly recommend this establishment|the staff here is very nice and the set up has tvs all around the family so enjoy mostly all sports the music is nice and pretty mellow and the place is very spacey and the prices are pretty reasonable and most importantly is the place seems to be kept clean at all times|good food and large portions i ordered the veggie burger for  and i loved it its one of the most unique veggie burgers i have ever had a homemade patty of beans rolled oats and veggies the chipotle mayo really gave it that oomph my burger was more than enough for me to handle and everything was worth the price as for drinks im a complete noob when it comes to beer but my friend ordered a tap and even from a small taste i could tell it was very good quality beer bitter and sweet with a slight tang i rarely drink beer but i im going to then might as well drink the best kind there is  fresh and microbrewednote there arent too many options for vegetarians the veggie burger was pretty good and id recommend it but other than that theres also the veggie tacos a few select appetizers and a few salads from which to choose|ive never been crazy about the food here but my friend likes it so i do eat here once in a while we stopped in last night and i had the chicken finger appetizer with fries the food was a little overcooked and nearly tasteless the ranch dressing was barely good enough to make up for it my friend had the mac  cheese with chicken and bacon which is what she orders just about every time shes there it looked delicious and the portion was huge ill be trying this dish next time were there weve also had the ball park pretzels in the past and theyre really good im giving  stars because the service was great theres outdoor seating and the berry bash sangria was delicious if expensive well be back|i am not a fan of chain restaurants typically and had to slowly break my boyfriend from wanting to eat at chain restaurants all of the time the one chain that i cant break from is rock bottom their beer is always good as far as their staples go i really love their white ale their seasonal ipas have been good and my favorite seasonals of all time included their chocolate raspberry stout yes it tasted as good as it sounds they had it last year around christmas and their smoky bbq brown ale tasted like summer complemented bbq amazingly  they had it this past summer i bought a growler of it lol as far as their food goes i typically stay away from the appetizers  and up is a little too pricey for me as far as appetizers go ive had their southwestern rolls and they were good but not worth  almost every time i go i order the baja chicken sandwich its my favorite chicken sandwich so good the chicken is actually grilled which goes for all of their chicken sandwiches and i love the charred flavor that it has the bun is soft but sturdy and doesnt fall apart while eating the sandwich the sauce is amazing the onion frizzles are the best and last but not least theres a half of a fresh avocado on this sandwich mhm i love it my boyfriend usually gets the hickory bbq bacon chicken sandwich and loves it as well another item i always get their apple coleslaw ive yet to find better coleslaw in a restaurant so simple yet oh so good they also recently changed their fries and these are much better than their old ones their side salads are awesome as well they are decent in size spring mix topped with sunflower seeds raisins half of a hard boiled egg which i give to the boyfriend chopped cucumbers and tomatoes and croutons yum i usually order the same thing every time i go i steered off my normal path once and ordered the buffalo mac and cheese and found it to be quite tasteless which turned me off to trying new items there plus i am just too in love with the baja chicken sandwich and apple coleslaw to want to try anything else service is always great the bartenders are friendly i love this place ask about their rock bottom rewards |i always enjoy rock bottom standard beers on tap are always great and their rotating selection usually has a hit as well i prefer the bar seating as to the dining room but this is a good way to separate the family dining from those of us without kiddos nachos nachos nachos truly the best in the area great burgers chili and salads reallyi dont think ive had a bad meal here nice outdoor seating in the summer this is a great place to watch a game or just hang out iced counter at the bar to keep your drink cold  i know they have other cocktails here but i cant order them at a beer place ive seen them and they do look good but im stuck to the beer selection they have a great happy hour and specials throughout the week service is always great whether there are two or  of us|every time ive been here the food has always been delicious and the service has always been very exceptional my go to is the laredo burger and the mac ncheese as a side they mac n cheese is absolutely wonderful if you like garlic ive had a few other menu options as well that have been superb the beers on tap are always great my newest favorite is the first pumpkin ale one thing i really appreciate about rock bottom is that they arent one of these restaurants that try to rush you out when youre done eating the food comes out fast which is great when youre starving but if you want to stay an visit with your date or eating companions theres never any rush i was just at rock bottom last night meeting friends for a movie that didnt start until pm we got at the restaurant around  ordered drinks ate and had a few more drinks and then just hung out for about a half hour until it was time to walk over to the cinemas it was nice not feeling rushed to leave as soon as we stopped orderingmy only complaints are that sometimes meat ends up being cooked a little more than you often ask medium often turns into medium well but thats not a huge problem for me i also dont think the signature cocktails are worth  but thats more of a corporate complaint since rock bottom is a small chain overall i definitely recommend eating here if youre in the waterfront|ball park pretzelwould eat again i came to rock bottom looking for a great beer full of hops that brings a refreshing sensation and satisfaction i then opened the menu scanned looking for those select bar items to pair with my great beer i saw an extensive list of items from chicken fingers to salads i noticed a ball park pretzel with a jalapeo cheese dip i was blown away the fact that i got  pretzels amazed me i ordered within  minutes of seating my pretzels hit the table within minutes the smell of the warm salt and hot cheese opened my senses but i knew we could step this shit up i asked for mustard and what do you know grey poupon dijon mustard is in front of my eyes i combined that shit and life evolved i went to heaven it took me  minutes to write this review because i took a solid bite with grey poupon after each sentence good look rock bottom keep up the good work|we have been going to rock bottom for sevesrl years and love it it is our go to place when we want a nice meal in a nice atmosphere  with good service we have had  maybe  not so great visits but for the most part service is excellent and the food is consistent  after leaving another restaurant just trying to do something new for a celebration because of poor service we were greeted and seated in a few seconds  our server was at our table within seconds even though she had a large  to  guests group at the table near us we had our drinks in minutes and were checked on twice within  minutes our food came out rather quickly and was delicious our server was very attentive and social as usual a save by our go to place i know we will retun here again|on a friday i went to rock bottom with some friends for their happy hour which takes place from  our server was a spunky brunette who was very attentive and even let us sample as many beers as we liked until deciding i ultimately decided on the pomberry cosmo which was excellent i also got the ball park pretzel which is amazing during happy hour its only  and you get two big pretzels served with this delicious cheese dip my friends got the nachos the quesadilla and the artichoke cheese dip everything was very tasty|first i have to say that ive been here twice in the past few months and each time was with a very large group one group of  one group of over  on a weekend evening and im thoroughly impressed with the friendly efficient and professional manner in which the accommodate groups whether increasing the number of diners at the last minute or providing separate checks they are flawless lots of other restaurants could learn from them impressively even with providing separate checks to such large groups they chose not to add gratuity and we obliged with good tips l managed to deliver food to everyone at the same time and processed payment of the checks in no time at all bravo to this restaurants management and service staff its top notchthat being said the food and beer aint all that bad either fish  chips chicken macn cheese salmon bites guacamole and the makers mark burger are all quite good as are the beers the klsch is my favorite|great bar great atmosphere great food cool place to bedefinitely one of those places you could keep going back just because its so chill and its a great place for friends to just enjoy some drinks and eat some good food nothing too too spectacular by any means but satisfies the taste buds their apps are the best part and the highlight of the restaurant in my opinion the nachos can be split among  people easy lots of toppings and yummy all around|i love rock bottom i dont frequent the restaurant side of rb as much as i do singsing but the food comes from rb i order practically the same thing every time bacon mac n cheese brewery nachos and a beerusually an ipa or a manhattan and the last two times i was at rb the food was disappointing it was cold and unappetizing my manhattan sucked and the service was worse the food is always better over at singsing for some reasoneven if they do come from the same place i was craving the mac n cheese so i went down to pick some up i had a gift card so i figured i wasnt out any money if the food sucked i saw that there was a new menu so i sat down to order i got the street food quesadilla bacon mac n cheese and beer battered onion rings i also ordered a homemade root beer and a few samples of the house beereverything was amazing it came out hot and tasted awesome they have a new head chef and it shows i was flooredthe new street food options are fun and tasty they are unique and differentnot something youd find at any restaurants in the areathe service was good my waitress was named liz and she certainly was on point she even helped me find a beer after i was sorely disappointed by the ipa offeringwhich was weird i always thought the house brews were tasty and fun no matter their style or make im an ipa girl but i would happily drink anything that came from their taps i was disappointed in the offerings but i ended up settling on the pale ale that was quite tastyin the end if you were turned off by rock bottom before id definitely recommend going back to check out the street food and new menu offerings service has dramatically improved food quality has improved  and i was thrilled|great american style bar food with quite a lot to pick from the both the food and drink menus they are also great at accommodating large groups and these are one of the few places that allow you to call ahead to reserve a spot been here plenty of times with my group and we enjoyed it every time|good beer food and service arrived on a wednesday night for business and sat at the bar bartender was attentive and nice food was great i had the bison prairie burger it was cooked perfectly and the flavor and fries were great ill be coming here again on my next business trip|they did a good job accommodating a large group mac n cheese with chicken and bacon was good in house beers were moderate and selection was limited good service franchiseish ambiance nothing extraordinary but easy enough|i am a fan of rock bottom  this is my nd time here and i can say i am a fan  we went on a saturday night after a day at sandcastle  the wait was  mins for a table of  which was to be expected on a saturday evening our server wasnt the best in my opinion  she was very friendly and some what attentive but it definitely took awhile to place our orders in for our drinks appetizers and meals  since we were all hungry i ordered us the nachos  they were awesome  very happy and pleased with that selection my sister ordered pretzels which were pretty goodbut the clearly had too much salt on them  the cheese dip that came with the pretzels however was awesome  definetly pleased with our selectionwe placed our order which came out in a timely fashion  everyone was pleased  the prices for the meal were about average for everything that you got  i got the the margarita pizza which was pretty good  my wife got jalpeno burger with fries  my son got the kids pizza  my sister and her husband got the seafood taco with shrimp and crab i believe  the best part of this place is that they brew their own beer here  everyone got a honey beer cant remember the exact kind but it was  for oz which was a fair price i think  all in all its def a place worth going|the food is always plentiful the atmosphere lively the service friendly and even though its always busy i rarely have to wait for a table if youre a nachos fan this is the place often i just make it my appetizer salad and meal yes its that big even though im not a big beer drinker i enjoy their sampler and i love their cider it had just the right amount of kick|im visiting homestead this week for some workrelated training  rock bottom was recommended by the receptionist at my hotel and im so glad it was  ive been there twice already and will go back before i leave in a few days  i sat at the bar during both of my visits and the bartenders were both very nicebob during the day and paul at night  the pumpkin beer and milk stout are both awesome  like other reviewers stated the nachos are great  i think the best part was that everyone was very friendly  other customers seated at the bar were eager to chat which is so nice when you dont know anyone in the area  great place  thanks for the hospitality|we stopped in to grabs bite to eat before we went to improv my wife and i got the bacon chicken maccheese it was absolutely delicious right down to the last bite we raved about it all night long our friend got a burger and asked for it well done it came out medium so she sent it back the manger brought out the new one and he took care of our friends check pretty great service she loved the burger and said it was one of the best she has had i had the beer sampler and i liked all six beers they were good i would recommend this place and if we are down that way i will definitely go back|great selection of beers especially the seasonal ones you wont be disappointed the jalapeo pretzels are dope|im not someone thats mechanically inclined so i cant say for sure that the deal i got was a good one but that said alan and the crew at master muffler certainly appears to have done a great job fixing my car to a degree better than i expected and at a price much lower than i was expecting and with a great warranty on their work i feel comfortable knowing that if there is a problem ill be covered i would absolutely recommend them to all my friends|the improv comedy club at the waterfront is the best comedy club in pittsburgh because there is only one other one and this one gets more famous comedians i go there just about every other weekpros great comedians all year round the fooddrinks are very good and the wait staff is wonderful the improv is a great venue for upcoming and new comedians i always see new local talent opening for national comedians in one show you will see  local comedians and  national touring comedians the improv has a nice environment inside with general admission seating first come first serve the email list is essential in order to receive free ticket packages and perks as well as reminders of upcoming comedianscons prices can be steep it is expensivedifficult to be a regular food and drinks are not cheap no specials expect to pay   for tickets depending on the headliner with a two item minimum waiting in line before the shows wouldnt be bad if you werent forced to stand outside in any and all weather conditions if it is raining and youd like a good seat you will pay the price overall this  venue is a great place to spend a night out with friends or loved ones you may buy tickets in advance onlinephone or buy your tickets at the box office at the location i highly recommend joining the mailing list to receive free tickets check the calendar for upcoming shows and open mic nights during the week support local comedy and enjoy the improv at the waterfront|i have a little bit of mechanical knowledge but not enough to land me a job as a mechanic i try to do a good bit of my own work to save on the repair bill and to avoid unscrupulous mechanics i called a handful of shops to get a quote to replace an exhaust manifold gasket and bolts on my  grand cherokee alan owner quoted me  per side i have the  v so there are  sides to fix it sure enough it was  out the door alan is a great guy that knows his stuff if it doesnt need to be fixed hell tell you it doesnt need to be fixed but if it does need to be fixed it really does need fixing he even checked on a couple of other things and made some recommendations for other specialty shops for projects i plan on doing on this jeep which he didnt have to do i chose to give master a shot after my normal goto shop in monroeville didnt return my call seeking a quote for the exhaust manifold some of the reviews on google for master are unfair with the chief complaint being a misunderstanding of personalities if you want to question what the mechanic tells you needs to be done fine just make sure you know what youre talking about if you have zero mechanical knowledge dont tell the mechanic how to do their job alan wont blow smoke up your dress and hold your hand if you want your car fixed take it to master thanks again alan for giving me the opportunity to boast on the jeep forums about only paying  for a repair that many have shelled out k to fix youre my new goto shop for our vehicles if youre curious as to their hours i was there a little after am they are first come first serve dont be an idiot and expect your car to be fixed  minutes after pulling into the lot oh and dont park in front of the garage doors like a tool|i always enjoy a good comedy club and though im a loyal helium fan i gotta give props to the improv near pittsburgh they chose a great location with surrounding restaurants of all genres and fun bars and shopping we bought tickets to see a comedian i had never heard of he was decent for  each with a two item purchase minimum i really dislike that rule but you cant really get around it the only thing i didnt like aka hated was having to wait in line outside before the show started it was freeeeezing they should put heaters outside seriously|you know that place where youve never gone then you go then youre going all the time well the improv for me is one of these placesi am thankful to have a venue to see some of my favorite comedians  most recently i saw hannibal burris tommy johnigan and doug benson all three performances were a hooting good time on saturday afternoon at pm i went to see doug benson i was accompanied by my boyfriend you may know doug benson from the hit documentary super high meok so pros wonderfully talented comedians clean bathrooms pretty wait staff has coors light on tap   per draft every seat in the house is a good seat consexpensive drinksexpensive food flavorless food dirty silverware far from my house mayo with french fries any way i have enjoyed all my visits to the waterfront  i can certainly see myself seeing more shows at the improve  the club is well maintained and the wait staff is friendly bring a lot of money with you youre going to need it i dont know if its true everywhere but at this improve there is are  item person minimum order requirement  they served us warm mayo with our fries what is this holland that sht was gross it was both gross and also unusualanyhow to catch a comedy show at the improve is a pleasure|this was my second visit to the club and it was still a blast my girlfriends bought tickets for john witherspoon for my bachelorette we were all looking forward to it and it was hilarious he was wonderful the servers were fantastic they always came back to check in on us and make sure we had plenty to eat and drink i suggest the pink cadillac for a drink as well as the cheese cake and chocolate cake for dessert the only reason it isnt  stars is because they had us wait an hour past the time we were to enter the building we were to see the pm showing so the doors were to open at pm they came out and explained that the show had run over and we wouldnt be able to even enter the building until pm it was  degrees outside we finally were able to enter the building order drinks then the show finally started at pm  the host did offer a blanket apology which was nice but hardly made up for the fact the show started almost an hour late|good i cant comment on the food or the bathrooms but from what experienced it was great the drinks were decent and i  believe you must order two items at minimum the staff is quick but they should have more people working on a saturday night before you can ask for anything else they bolt to the next table or to the kitchenthe comics we saw were funny as well will definitely go back|i have been here twice in the last month its a pretty great time my first visit the service was pretty poor and the food was cold by the time it got to the table we had to sit all the way in the back and the comedian was not that good although that is no fault of the club but when i went to the second show the service was much improved the burger i ordered was fantastic and warm our waitress kept the drinks coming without interrupting us while the comedian was on stage we were also able to sit in the front this time and it was a great experience ill be going back soon|i was so excited when my husband gave me tickets to go here to see funny man bill crawford part of the dve morning show for those of you who never heard of him  that is funny because as i was telling people about going it became clear there are a lot of people that havent oh well let me mention this was my first time thereso i was warned in advance of the possible long waits outside and the two item minimum  well to my pleasant surprise there was no wait walked right in greeted an usher showed us to our seats and we waited less than  minutes to be asked for our order  this was nice  i will say that the show started at pm and we were there by  or so  there were already people seated so we were by no means very early and heck there were people with full course meals and tables of   the price of the mixed drinks were not disclosed on the menu leading me to believe that it may leave me short for the mortgage next month but they did have a  minute dogfish head ipa for   now that may seem rather expensive and it is but doable so i indeed did it my husband got a domestic and it was between  bucks  we opted not to eat there as we were going to rock bottom after wards and i will get to that review laterso the show was good  there were moments that i think the comedians may have went off track and were just bantering but luckily enough they rebound and got back to making everyone laugh instead of being uncomfortable  there were a total of  comedians the mc and two opening acts for crawford  i actually really enjoyed them  the one or two things i didnt like about the place  the bathrooms are in the lobby  as this seems normal there is no separate area to enter back into the room without having to make your way through people who are waiting to be seated this wasis stupid  i was actually nervous that they were going to stop me and ask for my ticket which they safely secured at my first entrance  the same also goes for smoking  since we were so early i took a break and it was again awkward reentering  maybe they need to have some type of system to get around this  a stamped hand  a ticket stub  not sure but i know i would have felt better unlike feeling like i was sneaking into the place  i would definitely return to the improv  i just hope i always have a rather positive experience|i went here for the first time the other night and had a great time  the comedian was hilarious and it was a great intimate setting for a fun night out with friends  my only complaint was that it was a little pricey for the overall experience because not only do you need to buy a ticket but every person needs to buy  items of fooddrink and the drinks arent cheap around   however i would definitely go back sometime|wast there last friday seats right in front if the stage the show was good the headliner while a bit long was good fantastic service from our waitresses will definitely go back|great night out  i dont know if christopher titus set the ticket price or the club did but at  a ticket we will be going back often  great line up of top name acts coming to town  extremely nice staff highly recommend|absolutely loved it at the improv i saw sheryl underwood and she was fantastic it was my first time being at the improv after years of saying that i wanted to go it really did meet my expectations the ambiance is inviting with warm lighting and a good amount of seating for a smaller place we were th in line so we had good choice of seating though we were encouraged to fill the seats in the front by the stage first the seating is layered in tiers each tier has a long booth with tables and chairs for seating it was very comfortable roomy and an interactive set up the stage is close to the seating some tables are right at the stage with little space between you and the comedian which made it very interactive and fun we arrived at the improv around  pm for a show that started at  pm with doors opening at  pm we waited in line until the doors opened at about  pm so they were really behind schedule the show started around  pm with two opening comedians before the main act the show was over around  am the only negatives were that the staff was not very friendly and immediately told me that i have to buy a minimum of two items off of the menu ticket isnt enough i was not hungry and did not want to drink so this was a bit frustrating especially because it wasnt disclosed on the ticket or anywhere else the server did not hold us to the  minimum purchase requirement and my friend and i got away getting  drinks for the night the food menu looked great and the prices seemed reasonable though if you want water you are looking at  for fiji or sparkling it was  for a glass of wine  for bottomless soda complete with a take home improv glass the other thing that i didnt like was that an employee takes your tickets while youre waiting in line and marks your hands with a dry erase marker after one bathroom trip the mark was gone so i think they need a more effective way to mark you as an already paid customer since the employee takes your proof of purchase these negatives did not affect my overall experience negatively and i would most certainly go back it is a fun place where you are guaranteed to have a good time with a lot of laughter|nice little venue for quality fun  i saw greg warren here last night and had a really good time  check out yippitcom or sign up for goldstarcom before buying tickets at full price you can usually find substantial discounts for shows on one of those two sites sure theres a two drink minimum but im thinking that it helps pay for the comics and helps keep the price of admission down  when you think about it its really a winwin|the waterfront at homestead is insane and saves me the trip of driving all the way to ross park mall anyway the giant eagle here is enormous as youd imagine its still a standard giant eagle aka the best grocery store ever|this is the best giant eagle in the area and is the most like grocery stores in bay area heres why they sell beer huuuuuge produce selection naturalorganic foods section cereal pasta soups etc and fancy chocolate bars long isle of ethnic foods includes mexican indian italian asian and  of course jewish functioning bakery with fresh appetizing breads and desserts i am still loyal to allegro hearth thoughthe store is huge and i havent been to all of it yet but they also have nicer flowers balloons homeseasonal section dvd rentals and a photo center as well as a drivethrough pharmacy it seems as this ge just might be the answer to my grocery stores woes|probably the most comprehensive supermarket in the county if not all of southwestern pa its selection is considerably larger than what you can find in most giant eagles and it has more upscale items i live an easy walk from the swissvale giant eagle but i often drive to this location for the superior selection|i like this giant eaglethey have the organic section and theyre currentlyfeb  in the process of remodeling too which is both annoying now and exciting for the futureprosalways seems to be decent parking availablethey have those cute little doubletier cartsorganics sectionwine vending machine thats freaking awesomeyay pennsylvanialots of selfcheckout lanesconssometimes the staff is a bit cranky but that can occur anywhere i guess|as far as ges go this location is great it has basically everything you need and is well organized you can find a lot of ethnic ingredients you cant get at other ge stores they also offer a wine kiosk hot bar salad bar and bulk olives i would venture to say this is better than the market district|waterfront geagle is my primary market now that theyve expanded and reorganized i rarely even have to set foot in target anymore yippie theres a wine kiosk suck it pa liquor laws you can buy crazy expensive  packs cheese market bakery salad and hot bar butcher florist dry cleaners international foods pharmacy and a little cosmeticsbeautybath area they usually have a sufficient number of lanes open and it doesnt get nearly as crowded as market district i do wish a bulk spice selection was included as part of the expansion but you cant always get what you want i suppose|youre getting an extra star for two solid reasons  one is because the remodel is over and the store is pretty again and a bit fancier  two and thee most important part this iggle has the best quality and well made sushi out of any iggles out there  believe me ive eaten many a rainbow roll from many different locations around the burgh and nothing has compared  dare i say its as close as you get to going to a good sushi restaurant  bold statement right i  just love me some sushi and want it often quick and convenient and this serves all those purposes with upholding the quality  need a quick sushi fix  this place is it|this is easily one of the best giant eagles ive ever been to huge very nice selection easily comparable to whole foods went to their cheese market and was pleasantly surprised with the selection i got beemster vlaskas an amazing gouda very large parking lot|oddly enough of all the giant eagles i have visited in pittsburgh this is the only location that carries the toothpaste that ive used for most of my life outside of pittsburgh the location is clean and the staff are friendly  i sometimes resent having a market district being the closest giant eagle to my apartment as many of the items that i buy there are severely overpriced but whenever i run out of groceries and toothpaste at the same time i take the hike down to waterfront to shop here although they may not carry all the groceries that id like|this is a absolutely beautiful giant eagle  i only stopped in to grab a quick bite from the prepared foods section but i was rather impressed by how clean it was  it was  oclock at night and they still had a huge section of prepared foods available  the starbucks inside was closed probably due to the fact it was a sunday night but that is another plus|i found everything i needed and i liked the expansion the antipasta bar is on point and they sale vanilla coke which made my hubby very happy great store|im with rachel c on this one you get an extra star for being a pretty giant eagle and a cafe with a very decent beer selection of packs and individual bottles even though the giant eagle in robinson is better in my opinion you waterfront giant eagle are not bad and pretty close to where i live|i have to thank the bakery once again for getting me out of a jam twice bekka has made a great cake for my daughter when party planning was at its stress point her guest interaction is very professional and she always makes everything seem easy and manageable without a ripple thanks again bekka|just about every you needwith great hours a solid hot bar sushi if youre into that  a dry cleaning service pharmacy tons of produce bakery and butchers counter you cant go wrong two things that drive me crazy always needing to use my perks card for self check out and the lack of hand carts in the front i always have to walk to a lane and hunt for a basket then double back super annoying that said its a small and easily repairable hint issue that shouldnt keep you from visiting|one of the best grocery stores in the area good produce wide variety of cheeses good cuts of meat and theres even a six pack shop on the premise|years ago i would have given the big bird  stars what changed my mind competitive pricing thanks ge for making it worthwhile to shop your sales while your no aldi you definitely are winning on this front this is my goto ge always clean organized and great selection added beer a couple years ago and the deli prepared foods are up to par as well always busy and parking never an issue|i luv store plenty of cashiers my father eats there couple times a week he is a senior citizen and he usually get free coffee because he is a veteran last week he was told they no longer doing that program today he went to the edgewood giant eagle and they gave him free coffee|this giant eagle is one of the only things i miss about  old house the produce section and deli were great also had an overall nice selection of everything|this is a great supermarket  all of the staples  great deli market square and bakery  fresh produce and extra convenient to have vegetables and fruits cut and packaged  love the fact that i can shop drop dry cleaning and pick up pharmacy items in one stop  close to other shopping and wonderful restaurants|one comfy seat in the entire place but they have a cafe they have good books to look at and they are open until pm  what more could you want  why an apple purse of course  and a nice earl gray tea thrown in for good measure  wowi love this place  i am such a nerdonly a nerd would enjoy going to a book store and reading as much as i do  the extra amenities just make it that much more enjoyable|like any barnes  noble it has a nice comfy cafe and a large selection of books  the staff is very friendly and helpful  they stock a decent selection and the prices are pretty reasonable  obviously its hard for them to compete with amazon  however since all the small shop bookstores are gone its nice to walk into one every once in a while|i find this location clean and well organized but thats not the reason its getting  stars i called today to look into whether or not their may issues of magazines were out i need them for my job and erin so kindly went checked on every single magazine i asked about now that is customer service well done well done|such nice staff  i really lament the decline of the modern bookstore  i really enjoy browsing and picking up a new book  the store has a great selection and the staff are always helpful and kind  i really hope this store stays here for some  the prices are also fair and often have great discounts|there is nothing like a book and no better place to find one than a book store this barnes and noble carries on a long history of excellence they always have an extensive selection and a friendly staff that is willing to find what ever book you are seeking|i love books i love to look at them hold them read the cover thumb through the pages and then finally i love to dig into a juicy story when im in the area i love coming in here for a latte and book browsingreading most of the time i cave and buy a bookthis store is clean and their employees are helpful and kind they have two entrancesexits available a fairly large section for movies  music study guides and other organized sections like selfhelp and history i personally love the variety of cook books there one of the attractive points of this store is a cafe i can come in sit down read a magazine or book and just chill the downside is the chairs arent super comfortable to me and the cafe is usually packed with people i wish they had more seating options around the storeits a convenient location to come in and kill some time like others have mentioned theres a lot to find in there so come back and browse|fantastic food this place is mainly a bar and does get crowded but i really like the pizza here  in fact ive never had a bad meal  the staff are ussually very helpful but it does get a bit loud inside when crowded|dont even think about not getting the pretzel dippers its pretzel sticks with honey mustard cinnamon butter and a spicy queso dip the queso is my favorite but they were all delish i also got the bruschetta which was very garlicky but delicious  mf is  off appetizers so i was able to get both the pretzel sticks and bruschetta for  bucks as a meal the menu had a pretty wide range my friend very much enjoyed a pear and chicken salad we didnt get drinks but some looked good|went here for drinks and nachos and it is a very nice establishment  the nachos were very good the drinks pricy but t be expected in a setting like this place  there are fire places outside on the patio a huge bar and even though it doesnt seat many there is a very nice cozy setting upstairs  go here to relax or enjoy good food both thumbs up|ive eaten just once mostly i go for drinks nice lively place nice outdoor seating for the summer and falldrinks are good service is goodlocation is great as well right across the movie theater|love the ambiance and food| burger night on tuesday add ons more|haha only came here once for happy hour but i am just pleased with the price i guess coming from ny anything would be better price wise  for draft and a big selection of beers so good times also its right across the theater so its a good place to go and chill before the movie starts which is exactly what i did haha|im surprised by the low reviews i am a regular here perhaps it is a little bit pricey and that is the concern but it seems like everything is pricey these days their pretzel appetizer is fantastic hot fresh pretzels with sauces i also regularly get their grilled vegetable wrap with broccoli instead of fries or their salad wedge theyve got nice outdoor seating with great fire ornaments but well it is outdoorsin the past service was really bad i quit going for a while after having to do the wave for a check but for the last  years it has been really good ive found the staff to be professional attentive responsive and friendly maybe these are old reviews|one of my favorite places and they have thee best lemon drop martinis plus the bar tender looks like clark kentsuperman very handsome guy|i must say my experience last night at bar louie was wonderful i was hesitant to go because of the other reviews here but my husband convinced me to give it a try the place is seat yourself and its loud in there i was a little underwhelmed by that at first but i got used to it and found myself enjoying the energyour service was fantastic courtney was great  super attentive brought our drinks out in less than  minutes brought our food quickly checked on us just enough and the place was packedthe drinks were perfect just strong enough we tried the peach lighting and the tiki drink i liked the tiki thing better but thats just personal choice there were real berries mixed into that one yumon to the food my turkeyhambrie sandwich was delicious and my husband loved his burger the highlight of the meal though was the whiskey cake sonnetworthywell definitely go back again|man haters gonna hate  listen yall bar louie isnt fancy  its just not and their extensive martini list wont fool me  however the food is good ole american bar grub and their beer selection is decent  the staff has been nothing but nice even when my wannabe rowdy group of friends spent many a summer day sitting a table for four hours drinking dollar beers  as long as bar louie still keeps having  burger days tuesdays and  beer days wednesdays i will continue to be a fan  fyi its a fanatically cheap movie  dinnerdrinks weekday date spot|i rather like bar louie for my outdoor dining experience after biking the rail trail or before a movie  been there twice now for both of beforementioned occasions and both times had their appetizers  note that if you can catch them during their happy hour from  to pm on weeknights your pocket book will thank youthe two of us diners selected three appetizers to share the first visit and two on the second visit and were quite satisfied with presentation quantity and qualityi would highly recommend the bruschetta pomodoro and the calamari breaded just right and not overdone|great atmosphere and rather humble especially for a chain restaurant the service is always friendly even if they are busy i enjoy taking clients out for drinks there because of the enjoyable bartenders and wide array of drinks on their menu i highly recommend their chicken sliders and you have to try their tempura shrimp be sure to make a reservation because they can get busy too|its what i expected cooler then a fridays and the food was about the same it was clean and out waiter was really cool it was so slow he even took a seat with us and chatted but in a good way and we welcomed him to do so i had the bar louie burger for my meal and it was good nothing outstanding but again what i expected my group ordered the avocado fries and meatball appetizers the avocado fries were good but we had to add salt the meat balls with the small slices of garlic bread was fun to share and yummywe went on a slow sunday night it was clean and the food came out on time again i rate a places on what i expect it to be and what it trys to be not what i think it should be so just a different kind of fridays also great music playlist|my boyfriend and i dined at bar louie at the waterfront about a month ago it was my first time eating there and i was pretty impressedwe got loaded nachos as an appetizer and all the toppings were as fresh as they come not to mention deliciousi ordered pasta i cannot remember the name but i asked for no artichokes in it it turned out the artichokes were premixed in the recipe but the waitress came and informed us that the chef was whipping up a special batch just for me i was extremely grateful and impressedeverything was delicious the decor was industrial chic which i love and the atmosphere was buzzing and fun the menu was a tad exotic for my smalltown pallet but it was great my only complaint was the fact that you had to seat yourself because we wandered around the crowded restaurant for about  minutes before we found a seat the food and service certainly made up for it though|best place for a late dinner they have a pretty diverse and interesting  menu kitchen is open til am the atmosphere is very relaxing and staff is always pleasant|dollar beers on wednesday night and loaded tater tots pretty much two solid reasons to visit  matter of fact they have some sort of special every night of the week wether it be food or drinks or bothlocated across from the movie theater this is a good place to go before or after a flick with your hot date  i say skip over priced burgatory and come here on tuesday for dollar burgers  just as good and half the bill|was there for saturday dinner at pm and still had some seats opened  we sat down right away  you sat yourself and menu was at the table   very casual place yet family place   a little noisy so not for date nights  a little bit sports bar like but not like champs  food was great  had boneless chicken nuggets el fuego  side salad was very good  i had verde chicken pasta and my husband had cod skewers with shrimp fried rice  i had some and it was delicious  clean bathroom very important|great place for late dinner after work kitchen stays open late real good food full bar and real good service great location|i love bar louies happy hour  martini and half priced delicious veggie flatbread sign me up  they also have a few other apps that  are part of the happy hour but the flatbread is the one i usually get the melon martini is my current favorite but most that ive tried have been goodi dont recommend the shrimp appetizer and im not sure about some of the other food but happy hour is  stars the rest of the time bar louie is probably a  star place so if youre in the waterfront and are thinking of bar louie go for the happy hour|the place where my fianc and i first met went back for anniversary mentioned it to server and were given a free dessert to help us celebrate very very cool bar louie love ya even more now jerk shrimp lettuce wraps are so spicy hot they blew us away  extremely spicy  very good but caused us to order plain old soft pretzel to balance out the heat buffalo chicken flat bread  great but hot too|im not into waterparks as much as i am into amusement parks  i go to sandcastle maybe once a year  but my chicago friend catherine came in to visit for the weekend and after a day at the zoo we donned our swimsuits and came here  the main part of the park is closed in the evenings but the sandbar and the sandbar pool and the hot tub remain open for the  and over set  the sandbar has a great menu of food and drinks and has a  cover charge to get in  occasionally theres live entertainmentits hard to believe that before they built this place it was the site of an abandoned steel mill  actually it was the railroad yard for the nearby homestead works  but after siteclearing and cleanup they turned it into a beautiful place to spend a warm day or nice evening  the view across the mon is quite beautiful with a wooded hillside on the other side  theres even a boat dock so you can arrive by river if you desireim glad i renewed my acquaintance with this place and hopefully ill get another chance to come back|how many times do you get to fall at mph wearing only shorts sandcastle can make it happenif youre going its best to stop by giant eagle and grab you some discount tickets from the customer service desk   is still a bit much in my opinion but its better than spending the full there isnt much i can think of thats in sandcastle that isnt a great time except maybe walking around and scorching your feet on the boardwalk  i personally am a huge fan of some of the faster tube slides and of course the massive speed slide  if youre looking for a more relaxed ride check out the lazy river or screw around in the big pool  theres also a pretty nice wave pool there for your amusementtheres also plenty of stuff for kids to do but i dont have kids so i dont know how all that isthey do close at pm which is a bit early so be warned you definitely want to show up earlier in the day  but its definitely a good idea to close the park if you can right toward the end the lines disappear and you can ride over and over  win|so the last time i went to a water park was probably when i was in elementary school and didnt really know how to swim  i still kinda dont lol anyway it was in california at raging rivers and it was a traumatizing experience screaming  being tossed around in the pool that pushes periodic waves at the sound of a loud horn and ending up with scraped knees and feet not funso to say the least i was a bit nervous coming to this water park afraid to have another episode of feeling i was being drowned luckily that did not happeni seriously had so much fun here i honestly was only expecting to go on the lazy river pool all day but with my bf we hit up so many rides tandem and single rides i feel like such a big girl now definitely lean back while youre on those single donuts on the water rides or else you feel like youre going to flip over while swishing down the tubes the new dragon ride they just opened up was okay i was expecting it to be so much more fun but literally you just slide down a dark tube into a circular room where you just slowly swirl your way down the middle hole and that was it there was this one ride where you slide down the tubes for a few seconds then you land into a pool where a worker pushes you into another tube and this continues about  times it was weird kinda awkward with the worker having to grab you and push you through although it was still fun the last dude threw me in backwards scared the crap out of me but it was fun the food here is surprisingly pretty affordable plus who wants to eat a huge meal while in your swim suit me dont want no pot belly overall i had such a fun time here it definitely made me rethink my fear of water parks by the way we went on a saturday in early june and it wasnt as packed as i thought it would be so the lines werent long at all also go to giant eagle to purchase your discounted tickets you save a few bucks versus buying them at the water park oh and dont forget to bring sandals while walking around your feet will literally feel like theyre burning from the ground now go off and have some fun |i love sandcastle first let me say that im reviewing the waterpark not the people the park has little to no control over the people that visit the park and the way they or their children behave if you are going to visit i would highly suggest you try to go on a weekday ive attempted to visit on nice weekends before when the park has actually been at capacity and they are no longer allowing people in it gets crowded on the weekends especially if the weather is nice there arent a ton of nice days in the summer in pittsburgh so when there are nice days people come out in droves the slides are a blast the lines are sometimes very long but worth it the lazy river is great when its not wall to wall people i really enjoy the new dragons den but the line is crazy long for it they also have a fantastic bar area we have gone a few times and enjoyed a festive beverage while we enjoy the sunthey have several areas for smaller children which are all fantastic if you are visiting trying to take advantage of the giant eagle discount tickets because these can get really pricey you can also do a sandcastlekennywood ticket where you visit sandcastle during the day and kennywood at night its a fantastic deal but boy could that be exhausting|now heres a place that knows what it is a place to ride a few slides relax on the lazy river and watch the hilarious pittsburghers walk around with jesus tattoos and many children come for the slides stay for the people watching|we went to the sandcastle waterpark this past weekend before we went to heinz field  we are a family of four dad mom  year old girl and  year old girl  we all enjoyed it  there was plenty to do for everyone wave pool kiddie pools single tube slides double tube slides and body slides  it was a cloudy day in the upper s so it wasnt crowded at all  check for coupons at giant local flavor and other places  some things dont open until  pm even when the park opens at  am  parking is |for some reason i had a tremendous amount of anxiety about buying a new mattress maybe i was just selfconscious about rolling around on a bunch of beds in a public place abd mattress quickly alleviated any idiotic fears i may have had the store was empty when i arrived on a monday afternoon and i was attended to immediately and never felt pressured abd has a great selection of mattresses and the prices cannot be beat i picked up a full plush pillowtop mattress for a cool  without a box spring or a frame since i already had one better yet delivery is free and prompt you pick a threehour timeframe and the store will call you on the day of delivery to narrow it to a onehour slot so youre not sitting around all afternoon|im a mattress buying novice i also hate buying things that require you to trybeforeyoubuy i also seem to give explanatory information about myself before reviews anyway i had a lot of anxiousness about buying a mattress if its terrible youll be spending a large proportion of your life in misery until you fix the problem who wants that especially for something that can be as expensive as a mattress these people were great they patiently answered all of my mattress questions and treated me like a valued customer  both times i called the man on the phone remembered my name and number and took care of me when i failed to buy a box spring why oh why did i think i could go without a box spring they were able to take care of me over the phone and get me a box spring in the same day within hours even they even helped me set up the mattress that i didnt purchase from them which blew me away their professionalism and friendliness are excellent i will recommend them to everyone whos in the market for a mattress especially students because their student deals are fantastic|this is the most reliable car service i have experienced in pittsburgh amazing service for the last four years we have used them each week to pick up and drop off colleagues at the airport theyre always waiting by the hertz counter ahead of time without fail even when the flight is early or had a  hour delay they charge about  more than a yellow cab if you have client you need picked up or dropped off at the airport i would highly recommend first class my first time in pittsburgh when the driver heard i was on an interview he even gave me a free tour of a few neighborhoods in the city|the only place to buy a mattressboth my wife and i and our daughter desperately needed new mattresses so i decided to check this place out we went on a sunday afternoon and were the only ones in the store lee greeted us and showed us around the store they offer mattresses recliners dinettes daybeds bunk beds and bedroom furniture we found her a great mattress at a great price while waking around the store my wife found a serta icomfort series mattress for us that felt like heaven to lay on lee had told us about their free  month no interest financing through wells fargo bank free bed frame free delivery and set up of your new bed and free removal of your old mattress and box spring which made it a no brainer i went in to only buy our daughter a new mattress but i bought us a new one as well no one can beat their prices i compared the price of our new mattress to levin macys and mattress discounters no one came close to the price we got at american buyers everywhere else was double the price for just our mattress not including our daughters so it was like getting hers for free take it from me when it comes to your sleep do not buy a cheap mattress we bought a cheap supposed serta mattress in  from mattress discounters the boxed spring had to be replaced about  years after owning the bed i dont think i will have that problem again as our new serta has a full  year warranty a couple days later our daughters mattress was delivered first and about a week later our new mattress was delivered the delivery guys had our old mattress and box spring out and our new frame box spring and mattress set up in less than  minutesi highly recommend american buyers discount mattress for all of your bedding needs|i agree with the other reviewers i tried these guys based on the yelp reviews and was not disappointed im a grumpy new englander and have been frustrated by the small town easygoingcareless customer service at many pgh businesses these guys are different professional punctual even in snow|great customer service  i was in pittsburgh

towners needing to get to the airport but i had a last minute work conflict and couldnt drive them i was nervous about using one of the standard cab companies because their track record of actually showing up isnt great i called these guys the night before an am pickup and everything went smoothly dave even checked on their flight for us to make sure it was on time given bad weather if youre planning on getting a cab to the airport definitely use first class|after reading glowing reviews on yelp i decided to try this service to pick up my  year old mother and take her to the airport service was great driver was very courteous and on time we used them to pick her up at the airport and are equally happy the driver even carried her suitcases upstairs to her apartment|we always use

dave the owner and he was able to accommodate my lastminute request my husband initially went to the wrong meeting place on account of his sleep deprivation  so the company called me asap when he didnt show up right awayi reminded hubby about the correct meeting spot and all went well after that he was very happy with the service and the price id definitely use this company again for rides to and from the airport thanks everyone|im not sure what it is about this place that i love so much i have been eating here for probably  years now and it never disappoints its not fancy its not unique its not some fantastic restaurant its a chinese takeout place but it is delicious everything i have ever ordered is good the general tsos the chicken with broccoli the beef with broccoli the sweet n sour the teriyaki etc etc but the real treats are the egg rolls and the wonton soup their lunch specials are all six or seven bucks and are more than enough food for a big guy like myself it is also always ready in  minutesaffordable fast and delicious|havent been to tgifridays for years and was never really a huge fan i get tired of going to the same places all the time for lunch so we decided to try it out i must say that i was very impressed with how extensive the menu was and all of the delicious options i had the two for  lunch special with french onion soup and terriakyi glazed chicken strips i was told that the broccoli soup is very thick so i opted for the french onion it was okay but i think that i would get a salad instead of the soup next time the chicken strips were wonderful and i am still craving them the portion was huge and there were leftovers my coworkers ordered the jack daniels sampler and burgers and were jealous at the portion and choices from the pick two the service was good and we had no issues i will definitely be back|everyones been to fridays i am sure but i enjoy the yucatan salad its delicious my children love fridays its usually there st choice i also love the cajun chicken  shrimp pasta very very good|dining outdoors after a bike ride on the rail trail  just the right venue for thatjack daniels ribs and shrimp  the ribs were divine  the shrimp not quite there  id say they were overdone  our server ed was very attentive  i asked for celery in my bloody mary  not only did it come with a celery stalk in it he brought over more celery  yummmm|good food  i guess one reason i like this place is they dont hide how bad the food is for you there is a little kiosk with all the calories right by the door  all in all i get the flat bread pizzas and really enjoy themthe steaks are also good and the price is reasonableservice is always friendly and the establishment is kept really clean and neat|i didnt know what to expect when i walked in but i am now a fan there is a cool way to review the menu on a touch kiosk to find out the calorie count the place looked nice it was clean and really cool looking the food was really good and our waiter was nice and friendly i will be going back to try their pizza and other food we had a burger which was really good and we had the lobster slider french fries were good to|my girlfriends made reservations here for my bachelorette party last saturday i highly suggest that you make reservations because we were able to just walk right in and sit down there were people there waiting  minutes we had the sangria which was amazing our sever alex recommend it and it was perfect for the  of us  i had their thin crust pepperoni pizza which really hit the spot my two friend had salads which they said were amazing and my other friend joined me in ordering a pesto chicken pizza lets just say there wasnt any food left on the table when we were finished  i will be back for sure|unos has been around for ever  i feel like this restaurant chain peak in popularity in the s honestly the decor inside still kind of looks s to me even though its nice with sleek booth and exposed brickif you havent died and he recently i ordered you to come back and have a meal here again because honestly the food is really quite goodthey have the best chicken salad wrap ever i love that rap so much i want agreed to walk the south side river trail from where the steelers practice all the way to the damn waterfront just because i knew that i could convince my boyfriend to go to unos with me for lunch  full disclosure  i made him call is a cab and we took a taxi back to the parking lot after lunchlisten the food and pizza and service are very good surprisingly so i dont know why this place is not busier but next time youre down at the waterfront please do consider dining here|wham  stars outta the park the deepdish pizza we had was amazing i wasnt crazy about the avocado egg rolls but the chocolate chip sundae was superb great service too from maranda a doll decor is cute ambience is lively recommended|all in favor of a deep dish pizza say iiiiiiii  ok now that i have that out of my system this place is such a great hangouteatin spot i hadnt been here and years and some friends invited us out for the evening i was so glad they were paying cause  i was low on funds at the timewe arrived on a friday night and of course it was busy there we waited about  minutes to get a table which wasnt bad considering the crowd we looked over the menu and they have so many great choices pizza pasta appetizers seafood burgers salads and sandwiches after ordering two mango lemonades that were wayyyyy over sweetened we ordered our food we both are going gluten free which is tough but unos gave us a nice selection of dishes to choose from plus they make a thin crust gluten free pizza which taste great my hubby ordered the mediterrean thin crust because he loves kalamata olives and i ordered the guacalicious burger with a caesar side salad my salad came out pretty quick which was nice but it had a little too much dressing on it i didnt complain it still tasted greatim not into red meat so i tried to order a black bean burger or get chicken instead of beef but the ran out of black bean and they couldnt get the chicken so i just ordered it anyway the burger was piled really high with all the toppings including guacamole and it was very creamy but i couldnt get over the taste of the burger because it just didnt have any flavor very saddening i ended up just eating the veggies and discarding the meat i snacked on some of my hubbies pizza even though it was only a small amount we came here twice in one week the second time we ordered the grain deep dish with mushrooms parmesan and a garlic white sauce was this pizza amazing or what i will probably always eat this pizza whenever i come only down side is slow service it took  minutes for our pizza to come out and my hubbies was a little over cooked he got the numero uno which was ok but mine had way more flavor|i had the deep dish pizza and it was very good  the individual size was smaller than i expected for  but i wasnt starving so it was very filling  our waitress april was very nice and attentive for how busy it was  we had about a  minute wait but it was worth it  i cant wait to try it again|while visiting relatives in somerset we decided to go shopping in the nearby town of homestead  my aunt insisted that we have lunch at unos pizzeria  grill as the food was delicious  when we arrived i had to admit that i was impressed with the decor and atmosphere of the place  it was fairly crowded for a weekday but we were seated in less than ten minutes  the waitress was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu answering all our questions with ease  i settled on a turkey bacon and avocado sandwich and old fashioned tomato soup after looking over the menu several times  they have a variety of dishes guaranteed to please all ages  the food arrived in no time and was delicious  the portions were just right for lunch i was definitely ready for an afternoon of shopping  the four of us had items off the two for u lunch menu our bill was less than  which meant that i might could afford the shoes i wanted to buy  my aunt was right you cannot visit homestead without stopping to eat at uno pizzeria  grill it is fantastic|it gets  stars cause it jogs up a memory back before pizza hut turned into a fast food restaurant the pizza hut my grandfather used to take me to was a really nice restaurant and this location has the same look and feel as the old pizza hut before it went take out so this is the old style pizza hut very family orientated dining style you can sit here for hours and so we did we had a heap of use in a long tablei ordered one of the small pizzas which were buy  get one free disappointed in the selection of that seeing other choices i regretted going on the cheap prices are moderate  for a little pizza but with all the dough you get full cant say i walked away hungary nor did i finish my second mini pizza i want to come back and get that spanich fetta looking pizza|my kids who are  and  ordered the make your own pizza i initially had some reservations but it was actually fun for them and tasted pretty good too id suggest it for anyone looking to do something sorts cool with their kids for dinner|nice place to grab a bite and a beer service is quick friendly and accurate theyve got a respectable selection of craft beers and the atmosphere is very clean and comfortable good view of the tv from any angle in the bar area watching a buccos game at the moment and the bar itself is full service the baked stuffed spinoccoli chicken that i had was delicious i have no idea why i dont come here more often i should|i would write anthems poems novels about their pizza ive dreamed of their pizza since i was a child my only encounter with my beloved uno was when my mother came home with a take out box that she ordered for lunch that day  i would scarf down the thick wedges of pizza and greedily pick off the loose toppings from the box the cold  hour old pizza has since plagued my mind  i desperately tried to find an uno but found that the nearest one had closed down closed down my dreams were crushed my psyche disturbed i had become a changed person i wanted more i needed more my mother stopped coming home with uno take out boxes i stopped eating pizza i hated the flimsy crusts that were just cheap variants from my beloved uno i despised the new york style that you could so easily fold feh i would resign from eating pizza till i had my precious my precious my uno deep dish it wasnt until that fated day when i drove past an uno the neon lights called out to me it was like seeing heaven for the first time i stumbled into the uno dazed the smell was like nothing i had ever experienced on this green earth  there was nothing i could compare it too i sat down and ordered the numero uno with a side of fries  no not personalregular i wanted the entire thing not just a wedge of a dream i wanted the whole thing it came out steaming bubbling oozing fresh so fresh i took a bite  the cheese was perfectly melted and then another  the dough was so thick and tasteful and then another  ooh that sausageuntil there was nothing left i had achieved my dream but i will be back for more i will be backfor my precious but the fries were mediocre|service is always great at bath  body you know youre going into a scent filled area  i can spend a mint in here service at this location in particular has always been great even on the busiest of black fridays im guessing good management and good training bb always asks for an email address by i no longer get email coupons  like for years i get them in the usps but why ask for email address thenupdate i asked about the email coupons to the sales associate she instructed me to call the number on the receipt to let them know im not receiving she also gave me a  off coupon because mine i found online was only for online purchases much appreciated|i usually have good luck at this store and aside from goodwill its where i get my work slacks and jeans i find theres a good classic to trendy clothing ratio here so i can get a great white button up shirt or basic tees and peruse the more trendyish items theres always a great sale and the salespeople are friendly its a good bargain to get the ann taylor credit card and pay it off every month because youll get lots of great coupons for instore and online shopping|i love this particular loft store everything is nicely set and the atmosphere is relaxing the quality of clothes is really good and i do believe its good value for money they usually have more chic and classic clothes which i love the staff is exceptional here i love that they are really trying to help finding the right clothes for you instead of telling you how beautiful everything looks on you i always feel welcomed and i really do appreciate the fact that i am not being approached by a staff member every two minutes this unfortunately happens in a lot of other stores in this area this store feels more personal combine that with quality and affordable clothes and happy staff members and you definitely have a new regular customer|within the last six months loft has become my goto store for tops my daily commute takes me by the waterfront every day so its easy to pop into this location and check out their newest inventory loft does a great job of turning inventory quickly every couple weeks the store has new product with a full clearance section im also signed up for the brands emails so i know when promotions are going on they offer  off the store every month or so generally around major holidays and also offer  off clearance pretty frequentlyi enjoy the layout and store appearance much better than ross park and robinson ross parks store is very bland and robinson is currently in a temporary store shopping in an environment with bright fluorescent lights and boring white walls is just terrible so i enjoy the waterfronts pretty streetside location bestthe employees at this location are just ok sometimes i am cheerfully greeted at the front door but am generally ignored the entire time that i am shopping i recently had a very attentive sales associate who opened a fitting room for me when my arms were becoming full but i thought that i noticed someone with a district manager vibe lurking around which probably encouraged the associates motivation i actually had a very negative experience at this store during a recent sales event the event ended at pm on a weekday and i rushed to the store after getting off work i hurried around the store and jumped into line at pm all associates abandoned the registers at pm totally ignoring me and the other two girls waiting in line when i was finally helped several minutes later the snippy associate told me that the discount may or may not go through that corporate determined when the discount was turned off ok thats great but then why did you totally ignore me and your other customers for several minutes did you want us to not get the discount i was appalled by the rudeness of both the associate and a manager i spoke with earlier in the evening who was equally rude about the sharp end time of the discount what made the situation much worse is that a good friend of mine was a manager at loft a couple years ago and told me that ringing up after pm would not be a problem hah well it was a problem at the waterfront locationthe only reason that i gave loft  stars is because i love the brand discounts and quality of product as a whole the staff at this location is subpar and do not reflect the brand well i hope that loft does not lose customers based on negative customer service experiences theyre lucky that i like the product enough to ignore some occasional rudeness|when i lived in los angeles a year and a half ago p f changs was no great shakes one of millions of places with good but not outstanding stuff on the menuhere in pittsburgh its the only chinese place ive found that combines genuinely good service with quality food  not perhaps as good as what you can get in las top places but fantastic compared to its competition herethe kung pao chicken is particularly good with delicious fried chicken cubes and the usual hot sauce and chiles  chicken with lettuce wraps is good tootheir fried noodle dish with chicken whose name i have forgotten is addictive but has an odd sauce i dont quite like  still they get the friedness of the noodles right and there are precious few  ahem  no other restaurants around here that doportions are small so either plan to get an appetizer and an entree or expect to leave almost as hungry as you came  the minced chicken in lettuce wraps appetizer is outstanding and you get about the same amount of food as in one of their entreesif you live in la forget p f changs  if you live in nyc im sure there are a dozen better places on a single block  but here in pittsburgh its just about the best place around|any place that accommodates with a special dietary menu for a little known disease gets five stars from me  pf changs has a dedicated glutenfree menu for those of us who suffer from celiac disease  they also make sure to clean down the area they prepare the specialty dinner so as to avoid crosscontamination  i dont know many other restaurants that go this faraside from the menu preference i enjoy my overall experience every time  their menu is a bit different than that of what most people will be used to if you regularly eat a chinese takeout or buffet joints  dont expect this to be at all like that  its not a buffet  they dont sell general tsos though changs spicy chicken is recommended for those looking for something similar its my personal favorite or other signature foods that you may expect  they do sell very similar items with different names and a few of their own adjustments just make sure to read the menu description and ask questions if you are not sure  they also sell sake i believe they have a few different types  the prices can get a bit more expensive than your average chinese restaurant depending on what you get but its well worth it  portions are excellent and the taste is great  ive yet to have one complaint and i have frequented this establishment several times over the span of a few yearsthe only downside it can be a little crowded and a bit loud  its also very dark because of their lighting  however i think it sets the atmosphere  it can be a romantic place or a casual place ive been there for both|i like pf changsi think ive only been here a total of three times twice it was take out and i only get vegetarian dishes but what ive had has been pretty tastyi would definitely eat here again|i am writing this from the standpoint of someone who cant eat real chinese food because of gluten issues that said i am loving me some glutenfree chinese food here if the gf issue didnt exist though why bother when you can get real honest nonchain great chinese so many wonderful places in the burgh  but average chinese is better than no chinese if gluten is an issue so thank you mr

enjoyed browsing and checking out the items love bbw|my vegan friend deb turned me onto the fact that one can dine at pf changs and stay on a vegan dietvegan friend deb vfd asked the waitress if they could prepare a version of the famous chicken and lettuce wraps the waitress without hesitation proclaimed they always had a vegan version but it was never put on the menuwarning even though its vegan it still contains the same amount of salt that was reported on all the news channels when the salt fat and cholesterol police made the sodium content available to the public the vegan version is just as delicious and the chickenthey also have vegan dishes like string beans and garlic eggplant and garlic and a few dishes with tofu and vegetablesi always loved the fact pf changs offered brown rice that nutty flavor goes so well with their mealsthe service staff at changs is always top shelf ive never had a bad time here and love when we go|we visitied pf changs on sunday with a large group of  people  although they had to split the tables  everything was deliciouswe enjoyed everything from the spring rolls and chicken lettuce wrapsto the mooshu that they made special vegetarian for one of the gueststo the fried banana dessertif you are with a group and you want dessert  get the fried bananas  they come wrapped in a spring roll wrapper and with coconutpineapple ice creamoverall we had a great time and would come back here again|so i have never been to pf changs before since im chinese and im not a huge fan of eating at chineseamerican restaurants when i can eat delicious authentic chinese food at home courtesy of my momma my boyfriend and i were at dave  busters and werent in the mood for american food which was what we were all surrounded by so i decided to give pf changs a try we came on a saturday night without reservations so we had to wait min  luckily time went by fast while i was on my phone looking at the yelp reviews for this place when we were seated we ordered immediately and our server was very friendly we got the salt and pepper calamari as an appetizer and then the dan dan noodles and shanghai shrimp with garlic sauce the food came out quick which was a huge plus considering how busy they were the calamari was okay i felt like the strips were cut too thin and we should have received more the dan dan noodles were actually very delicious and flavorful i really enjoyed them and definitely recommend them the shrimp was cooked well and was also good overall i was happy with my first time experience here and would consider coming back if im ever in the mood for chineseamerican food|my daughter  i enjoy  pf changs each time we dine there together i am in love with the chicken lettuce wraps delicious it is always a wonderful experience|used to wait hours for food here a few years agosecond visit in  months   kung pao shrimp was very saltyvery good servicegreat wall cake still very good  kids will not leave without having it|ive always liked pf changs and generally speaking this location is pretty good i typically opt to sit at the bar where the service has always been extremely personable and fastthe food is typical pf changs delicious as one of the chains that provides their nutritional information its also nice to know that i can go there and eat somewhat healthy im all about the orange peel shrimp and steamed shrimp dumplings while some complain about the portion sizes being too small ive always felt like they were perfect i do understand how someone looking at a  plate of chinese food could wonder why he or she is paying more for less than your standard chinese restaurant but its never bothered me most of the meals are consistently good freshly prepared and full of flavor plus the sauce that your waiterwaitress makes for you is always a nice addition to any meal ive tried most of the apps soups and quite a few of their entres and have never been disappointedive only had one negative experience at this location in the countless times that ive gone and it revolved around service in the main dining area i was there for lunch and the waitress essentially disappeared im not sure if she had been fired quit or what but she took the order and was never seen again after sitting there for what seemed like an eternity with empty drinks etc i finally had to ask if someone else was going to be our server i had never experienced something like that but i received free food vouchers for a future visit and luckily i wasnt in a rush that day so it worked out the experience wouldve made me give the location a worse rating but one bad experience hasnt outweighed the countless positives good meals solid service especially at the bar and great takeout service for large orders and smaller onesthe only other knock on this location  and it applies to every pf changs ive been to  is the insane wait that youll encounter at dinner time my wife and i would actually go there more often if we didnt have to wait forever for a table i love pf changs but i hate waiting more if you live close enough get curbside pickup or just find somewhere else ive yet to meet a restaurant worth a hour wait pf changs included|singapore street noodles  the end|the service started out slow but they eventually picked up the pace we ordered the chickenlettuce wrap appetizer and we enjoyed it for the entres we had the fried rice and mongolian beef both of which were delightful i would not mind going back to explore their menu|great food great atmosphere little on the loud side but they have turned down the music since the last time we were here so its much better good service|we recently went here for a group dinner with friends  i am unable to eat gluten and my server denice was knowledgable and brought me special sauces as not to irritate my allergies  she was amazingly accommodating and when my meal was too spicy which was totally my fault she got me something else  i had the gf beef with broccoli and it was amazing  she was personable and friendly and went beyond expectations to make sure our table enjoyed themselves  we were there for a while and were all on separate checks  ive been to eateries before where that was treated with great disdain  never once did i feel unwelcome  i will go out of my way to eat here again|good quality pork fried dumpling and mongo beef  bar service was fast and efficent   good value  not a  cause dragon eye tea was cold first time around and beef had minor amount of fat   fortune was even postive|i usually have fair experiences with this pf changs ive been inside the restaurant and have used the curbside to go service i finally decided to review this based on my most recent experiencei cant remember her name but whomever worked curbside to go on oct   around pm deserves a mention she was very nice and provided us with the exact amount of condiments we listed on the online order form theyre usually stingy with the chili and hot mustard sauces she also gave us a couple other sauces to try not sure which ones but these were very good the food here is always in point i like to get the edamame sesame chicken with brown rice and the flour less chocolate dome im reducing a star because of past experiences with service|really awesome food and amazing customer service i really enjoyed my experience here if i am back in the area i will be certain to come back to this location|i will say make a reservation since its pretty busy on a weekend  we got seated quickly with a reservation  our server was excellent despite how busy it was  he was also helpful with recommendations and let me sample a couple wines before picking a bottle  the manager was also great  we werent in love with one of the dishes and the manager came out and talked to us about what we were looking for and gave us a complimentary order of what he recommended  i will say this  they know how to treat their customers well definitely be back |first this is a big chain  not my favorite type of eatery  for me four stars is max for this type of establishment for the simple reason that no one has license to create anything truly uniquehowever  the chilean sea bass marinated in oolong tea is freakin fantastic  now  everyone was happy with their meals and let me tell you it was a ridiculously busy night servers were threading their way through patrons waiting to be seated and our service was very goodive been to pfc vegas and pfc nyc  our homestead pfc definitely beats them both  so many great little places to try in the burgh but i wouldnt resist going back to this particular pfc|we had another opportunity to eat here today and the experience was much improved there was no crowd to fight and we werent seated near the door as we were last time as i expected getting a table near the edge of the restaurant provides for a much nicer dining experience our service was good and they accommodated our  year old nicely i appreciate that they serve steamed veggies on the kids menu i still left with the impression that the serving sizes were small in comparison to most other places but we were satisfied and happy|went here for lunch yesterday with a friend and it was so yummy started out with chicken lettuce wraps and it was totally hitting the hungry spot lol tried chicken lettuce wrap at my places but this place is one of my fave their wonton shop is also full of chicken chunks and shrimps as well which is different bc you dont normally get all that in a wonton soup bowl  by the time we ate the lettuce wraps and our soups we were almost full love the way their mongolian beef is made here and my friend had the crispy honey shrimp and it was so yummy as well definitely will be back because this place is clean service is quick food is delicious and the price isnt so bad either|this is the fourth changs ive eat ate it was pretty good the food was kinda like it had been previously frozen had a strange texture some of the changs chicken pieces was stuck together and the breading on the sweet and sour chicken was mushy and falling off the chicken overall still pretty good would eat at this one again|our family loves this restaurant  my children and i suffer from food allergies   i have celiacs disease and their gluten free selection for a chinese restaurant is great  my children are a completely different ball game  they have a rare disease called eosinophilic esophagitus where food attacks their body  they are very limited on their food selctions due to not being able to consume any food with gluten soy eggs dairy nuts tree nuts fish shellfish amd corn  this restaurant takes special care of my kids by making sure they get chicken that has not gone through the egg wash  the servers and managers are all trained in how to be careful  our favorite manager is joe and favorite server is kevin  call ahead if you have any questions and they will answer your questions|this place hit the spot stopped here before a movie and ate at the bar we got just what we wanted quick service and some good eats i recommend the fried green beans with aioli   soooo good who knew i liked green beans and this trip i tried some sushi and got the spicy tuna roll although it was clearly not pieced together by an expert sushi chef it was extremely fresh and delish so who cares if its not beautiful|excellent beef with pepper and onions waiter made a good wine choice fastest food delivery less than  minutes honest both meals less than  in and out in  minutes|good food good service and always an enjoyable visit they forgot to put in our appetizer order but threw it in for free to make it up to us a good place to catch a meal if youre down around the waterfront|thank you so very very very much to the management hallie  she literally helped me with immediately with an error that was on my gift card  also hallie visited our table during our meal to see if everything and everybody was okay also our server aaron was really helpful and sweet  i am a very very picky eater  i dont like onions garlic peppers mushrooms broccoli rice etc  aaron was awesome in his help as i selected my food   very rarely do  i eat dessert  i love their  pineapple coconut ice cream  there banana sprung rolls are good but the ice cream is to die for  the two come together|meal was about what i expected service was good not exceptional but good they are trying a new menu with tacos for breast cancer awareness  a nice thought but they should stay in their wheelhouse which is asian obviously stick with what you know|i used to work here  haha many moons ago tho  usually you leave a restaurant job sick of the food and the people but even after i left i still love going in and talking to the staff and getting something to eat and drink and just hanging out  im a changs chicken junkie and i cant stay away from it for too long  the bartenders have always been some of the best ive ever seen no matter how many changes theyve gone through and this is one of the few places where even years and years later the same people work and still love it  says a lot about the people  changs chicken chicken lettuce wraps and pork won tons though are the standard fare are always amazing  some other excellent dishes are kung pao chicken shrimp dumplings mongolian beef and the ahi tunait might be a chain restaurant but this one is one of the strongest links in the chain|if i had to pick my very favorite chain restaurant it would be pf changs  im aware that its not authentic but that doesnt mean its not deliciouswe stopped by after some shopping in the area on a snowy friday and were able to get a table pretty quickly  the hostess and server were both friendly  my husband enjoyed a glass of sake and i had a mai tai that turned out to be delicious  we split an order of lettuce wraps as an appetizer they dont custommake your sauce any more which is disappointing but they did happily provide us with chili paste and hot mustard to doctor it up ourselves  his changs spicy chicken extra spicy turned out great and provided the extra requested heat  my orange peel shrimp were as good as id remembered perhaps better because they have some fresh orange slices included as well  we also ordered a great wall of  chocolate  if you like  chocolate cake at all youll love this onepf changs consistently provides good chinese in a trendy but still casual atmosphere at a decent price and im always a fan|this is largely a review for sean a managing partner at this location i had gone to this location while in town with my family for the holidays looking for a noncooking escape before getting inundated with guests a few of us ordered the lunch special with soups my mom had ordered the butternut squash ravioli and we also got an order of street noodles and started with summer rolls everything was great the street noodles in particular are fantastic but the service was a bit of a disaster dishes came out more than  minutes apart from each other a huge mood killer with a big family meal a few dishes came out dirty soups didnt come out at all and our waitress made up excuses and didnt apologize when she had in fact missed some of our orders we were feeling really ignored and discouraged until we let sean know he took great care of us and went way way out of his way to make up the experience i really cant thank sean enough for making sure we left in a good mood after what could have been a very negative experience heaven knows that a positive tone is essential going into the holidays with family|gordons in the waterfront is exactly what i needed for new shoes after i was allowed to walk again after a fracture in my foot  the man who waited on me was kind patient and even let me know about a sale going on  the selection and quality of shoes is wonderful  you wont get cheap shoes here but you will get the best worth every cent|extremely helpful staff that knows exactly what shoes are comfortable yet stylish the shoes i bought were high quality and durable i was extremely impressed by the staff|this is by far my favorite panera location in the pittsburgh area friendly plenty of room to sit and good quality food  coffee panera is a great place to hang out and read the news  they even have free wifi try their toasted sandwiches especially the chicken bacon dijon|i live close by so i go here frequently pretty much for the free wifi and espresso but heres a secret  they dont seem to know what an americano is so often i am charged like  cents for a double shot of espresso to which they add hot water upon my request needless to say coffee is not expensive here as you can fill up as many times as needed without being hassled although there regular coffee is undrinkable to my taste pastries are baked fresh and are plentiful there is other foods to choose from ie whole grain bagels are edible and about a buck with no extra charge for butta outside seating and people watching is always a good distraction plus there are all kinds of people who frequent this panera from the very very old and decrepit to the fashionistas taking a break from victoria secrets ulta wet seal and the other various shops at this water front location|i really enjoy panera and this restaurant meets my expectations i particularly love the asiago cheese bagel caesar salad bacon turkey bravo sandwich tuna salad sandwich smokehouse turkey panini broccoli cheddar soup and iced chai tea latte ive ordered all of these items at this location and they have been very tastyi have had this location run out of the side of french baguette once or twice however last time that occurred i asked for a bread bowl as a replacement which i was given for freeill definitely be returning soon|i love all panera equallyi am def a fan of this easy better than fast food timekilling eaterygreat place for a lunch socialdate with good eats and a good place to sit and talk for a while or to get some work done between appointmentsprosgreat foodfree wifi though some locations are limited to  minutes during the lunch hourseating is always tricky at the lunch hourconspricey for salads soup and sandwichestables should be wiped more frequentlyeven if you have to ask a newly seated guest if they would like it wiped the tables should be wipedfor petes sake give a fork with the mac and cheese not a spoon  lol|its the same panera food youve had before  i like the other ones better as they are often  faster at preparing food than this one  that said the food is fine and the staff is nice enoughthey have warm cookies for   that is a nice feature|amazing amazing place and i really enjoy to eat there and drink the prices they not high very good service and fast |this use to be my go to panera bread  when i worked in the area i would stop here before work to grab my breakfast and then stop to get my lunch as well  i was happy when i left the area and moved on to bigger and better things  my waist also appreciated it  those scones are deliciousi recently stopped back here when i was shopping and was pleasantly surprised  with all my new allergies i came in here hoping to get some bread  not knowing nor doing my homework before i showed up i asked the manager if one particular bread had corn syrup in it or not  not knowing the answer herself she was kind enough to pull out a binder that contained all of their recipes ingredients included  after looking through it for a few minutes i was able to select the bread i wanted  they will sliced the bread thick or thin for you there right now  if you would rather slice yourself i am sure they will wrap it up and you can go on your way  yes its true it may be a bit more expensive than your cheap bread on the grocery store shelf  but it is much better tasting|panera is one of our familys favorite restaurants everything is great kids love bagels and chicken noodle soup adults usually order you pick two sandwiches salad are all very good|it was my first time here  was recommended by my coworker  however i was a little unsure as ive read some bad reviews about this placethe first visit was great  the receptionists were helpful and gave me guidance on how to get my dog licensed  everyone seemed happy and talkative  dr bezak was very nice  he had a smile on him the entire time i was there  he was very quick to give me information about anything and everything relating to the dog  overall i had a good first visit and definitely going backthe only thing that made it didnt earn a fivestar is that my appointment is at pm  the entire office have their lunch at pm  so i can tell there was alot of hustle to get me out of their asap  i dont mind that it was a quick visit but i would have liked to had time to ask more questions  if you want adequate time with the doc consider making your appointment after their lunch|as not only petowners but as dog breeders let me say  we love this place  weve heard some bad things from several acquaintances and counldnt believe our earsdr bezak is great and the staff is really friendly and helpful|i only allow my dogs to go to dr bezak ive had a couple chow chows who a lot of vets are afraid of doc had a chow himself so knew what to look out for in the breed he has taken good care of them over the years|what can i say im a shill for target  like another reviewer says you have to watch the impulse buying here because it is so easy to dobut as for the name brands here ive never had a problem with them  i bought some woolrich blankets and sheets here that my husband and i have been very satisfied with  the housewares section here is positively unbeatable  my husband rick is an amateur chef and he could blow his paycheck on the kitchen utensils  he particularly likes the michael graves ones  he is also an amateur photographer and he still works with film so he likes the film development hereme i also like buying household cleaners and personal items such as soaps toothpaste deoderant etc because the selection is so good  ive also purchased a lot of my casual wear here|omg target is my fav store ever i love the staff they are also so helpful and friendly they recognize me being there quite often i also greatly appreciate being able to use a target coupon and a manufacture coupon  i save so much money shopping  there and now i save  everyday using my target debit card ah i love this store|oh target  you are big corporate america  but how can i not love you so  your prices are the best whenever i need household goods like detergents cleaners etc  for personal effects such as toiletries soap etc you cant be beat  your cookware and bakeware department is every bit as good as macysand i see you have the retro tees too  you know  yes httpwwwdovenetqnetaumahayesgraphicsyeslogofullcirclejpg boston httpwwwvinylrecordschbbobostonbostonbostonjpg led zeppelin httphenrikfalckcombloguploadedimagesledzeppelinledzeppelinalbumcoverjpg  we know what retro tee means  faux aged catering to boomers and teens and costing way more than they origianlly did  oh and made in china of course|after working for the rival of target for years target has become my favorite mega chain store to shop at  although it does not seem to have every single item as other stores im still able to get in and get out in a hurry  depending on the time of day it may be a task just to find a parking space due to the traffic light at the end of the road  if you dont mind walking a bit the aisle where the pharmacy sign is on the building usually has spots closer to the front of the storethe only downside i can find for this location is the smell of overly burnt buttered popcorn as soon as you walk in due to the cafe location  i prefer not to vomit as soon as i walk into a store maybe after about ten minutes in id consider it|this is a really great pharmacy  friendly quick knowledgeable and inexpensive|target is pretty standard if youve been to one of them youll know largely what to expect from this one that being said this store is clean and the deals one clearance can be good just make sure to check the circular and the website as sometimes additional coupons can be found that the store personnel arent aware of the electronics department staff are not very knowledgeable and tried to pressure me into buying a different tv by repeating marketing lingo but were unable to explain what their claims actually were when challenged on them so make sure to do your research beforehand if purchasing electronics|target is one of my favorite stores  i just love wandering around late at night when the store is quiet  its just so therapeutic this location is now my closest store so i drop by pretty oftenthis store is pretty average inventory and customer service arent particularly stellar but isnt poor either ive generally been able to find what i need here and check out pretty quickly in addition to the common pharmacy and photo studio found in most targets this location also has an optical department of the  locations in the pittsburgh area only this store and the cranberry store sell glasses i purchased a pair of glasses and sunglasses through target optical three years ago and have been very happy with their product and customer service|i was in and out and i didnt wait in long to long so im happy|target and i go way back like the drivers seat in my brothers car despite my murky history with target i prefer it way more over walmart which is closer to home just overall quality atmosphere and clientele is way better we needed a large number of photos printed and my father had decided to go to fedex i can only imagine this decision because theyre known for print quality they should also be known for being cumbersome and overcharging after an hour of struggling with their machines to print we left i suggested target because we were in the area and i halfway remembered that they used the kodak app to develop pictures from your phone as soon as we get in its always a win because pictures are  compared to  at their competitor it was easy to sync up the photo library via wifi to the kiosk with the app after choosing and modifying all of our pictures we were given a slip stating our order of  pictures would be ready in  minutes we picked up everything else we needed and checked out finishing in  minutes by then our photos were done and we checked out at the photo stand paying less than half of what we anticipated paying at the other place plus the quality was fantastic the photos werent too glossy and everything worked out perfectly will we be back absolutely|ok i know what youre thinking  youre a chick  why are you rating mens wearhouse  well recently the bf and i went shopping for some business friendly clothes for him  our wardrobe expert and i feel terrible because i forgot his name was incredibly friendly and helpful that i couldnt help but think  why dont they have stores like this for women  someone who helps you  no matter your size or height finds you the pants that fit your body the dress shirts the jackets etc  this man was absolutely stellar  incredibly personable and he knew his job well  the bf left with exactly what he needed and i may or may not have talked him into a few other items what can i say i like a sharp dressed man cue zz top  so if youre looking to make your man a little more studly with a jacket tie dress shirt or perhaps a full suit stop by mens warehouse  youll be drooling over him in no time |i went in to get my suit that i bought last year tailored because i had lost some weight and i couldnt have had a better experience when i walked in i was immediately created by bill who was warm and friendly anna came out to perform the measurements and mark up the suit she checked everything even changes i hadnt thought to have made to make sure the suit fits me perfectly when they are done best of all when i asked if they could ship the suits to me at my house since i no longer live in pittsburgh they asked when i was leaving town and promised they would get it done for me before i left  the next day better yet they had the suit ready for me early avoiding the rush for me to pick it up before i left everyone was extremely helpful and diligent and i will continue to only get changes done at this store|after numerous visits to the mens wearhouse throughout the years i would give this place a thumbs up the service is always excellent the products are comfortable and if items do not fit they can be altered for a fee in the long run the alterations make for a perfect fit|i got pizza here on a saturday night in a pinch  looking for a place that sells by the slice i drove around for a while  not only did they have bytheslice pizza but they also had some of my favorite toppings  i also hate crust thats too thick and  although i prefer it even thinner than it was  i was pretty satisfied with the crust  the only thing that could be improved is the salad  we got a grilled chicken salad  the chicken and fries were okay but the rest was pretty run of the millas for the pizza ill definitely be back for more|i just had a white pizza with added spinach it was delicious i love the thicker crust that was crunchy and chewy at the same timei also got a greek salad and you can tell the dressing was homemade cause it was perfect|pros great selection and excellent service they had knowledgable personnel on the floor manager who was helpfulcons traffic to the store one lane got pretty congested wouldnt give me a coupon that i had forgotten at home but thats not a big deal|i head straight back to the clearance thats where youll find the best deals you will be able to see your savings when you check out because its calculated on your receipt im a huge proponent of going after summer and winter seasons to stock up for next year  boots galoshes and sandals never go out of style|i have no idea why ive lived close to this dsw for nearly a year and had never shopped here before this week i was looking for a very specific pair of heels and dsw was my go to place i found a fabulous namebrand pair at a great price while browsing around there was an associate who was slowly straightening shoes but she made no effort to talk to or even smile at me which is awkward because i smiled at her thankfully the cashier was an extremely sweet and outgoing older lady who encouraged me to sign up for their loyalty program though i didnt really need to sign up she was so kind that i couldnt say no i plan on going back very soon|ive been coming to this dsw approximately every other month over the last year the waterfront is my goto place when i need to do mindless wandering and shopping and this store has been added to my regular itinerary i came here on friday night needing to zone out and to just try ridiculous amounts of shoes for fun i headed back to the clearance unusual for me and wow what a selection seychelles summer wedges for  minnetonka suede booties for  both the styles and the prices were spot on i ended up purchasing a pair of audrey brooke summer wedges for  along with some nina silver wedding pumps for  what bargainshowever im not writing this review update to just talk about fab shoe finds and great deals  the first several times that i shopped here customer service was dismal as mentioned in my previous review however the last couple times ive been here ive seen associates as soon as i walk through the door and been quickly offered assistance this is a significant difference from what i experienced in the past and i just had to recognize this store for making positive changes keep up the good work  and the great assortment  and ill be back often|i love bed bath  beyond the employees at this particular one are always available and helpful  the selection plus the  off coupons keep me coming back and its also where i get all of the things for my soda stream overall i will be back many many times|basically after being sent here after not having the item at another location i walk in and go to the exact spot that the item is suppose to be  and yet again the exact one is not on the shelffrustrated i walk to the customer service desk and ask whether or not they have it  which the response i got was to basically look on the shelf  after i told them i did that already one of the employees had an ingenious idea  instead of checking the kitchen part of the store why not check the bath part  what do you know thats where it wasso that just makes me think that they had this item at the other store but just werent in tune with knowing that the item was located in another part of the storeeverything after that was a smooth ride  wedding registry updated purchased and gift wrapped  yes these places have an area that you can gift wrap for free  it says its a do it  yourself area but for some reason an employee did mine for free  only downside is that some of the gift wrapping that some of the wrapping items have the store name on it which might look a bit tacky|this is a very small yet nice store the associates are nice and helpful not much else to say about this particular store just a pleasure to purchase from|when i go to other pizza places i ask myself will this be as good as pizza companies pizza  i dont understand how this place hasnt gotten papa johns big cause rarely do i get a pizza or a sandwich thats inconsistent with the last one i got  the steak untouchables though not primantis is the close runner up for my favorite sandwich with everything on it  the hoagies are never soggy and this might seem like a small thing but they use shredded lettuce  i hate when you go somewhere and its just regular ripped off the head lettuce not this place  i do think its a little expensive but ive watched the prices go up with the economy and their popularity so im sure its justified  side tip go in and get a slice of pizza its a little different than their whole pizzas you order  its really goodoh yeah be sure to ask for longfellow bones hes a cook there and a hell of a rapper  tell him hittofmcm sent you|coffee i have a keurig vue and this is the only store ive been able to find that carries vue cups the only other place i can find them is online and im not a morning person so waiting a week for shipping is just not an option sometimes aside from that i feel like all they jam pack the store full of everything they can  not that thats a bad thing but it does make it hard to find what your looking for sometimes|eat n park is pittsburghs version of ihopgreat food at cheap prices really good salads sandwiches and burgers like dave p said this is one of the better locations probably because its right next to the headquartersservice has always been go at this location|i love eat n park whenever i come to pittsburgh i go to this restaurant this area is great in the waterfront its so peaceful here pittsburgh is a beautiful city eat n park has the best pie i wish we have this at home their banana cream pie and their strawberry pie are my familys favorite their food is better than ihop they are so cheap you can get a slice of pie for   they have a variety of everything and they are clean their cheese fries milk shakes and their breakfast menu are great not everything is great on the menu but they have everything you can think of in a diner and the best part is they are open  hrs a day if youre hungry in the middle of the night they have a midnight menu i like this location better than the one at squirrel hill the waitresses are nicer and the food is better we stop here every time we are in town they are not a fancy place but they have good cheap food try the food you cant go wrong with the money youre paying|this is the best location of the best restaurant in the world i visit eatn park every chance i get when i come from out of town i regularly have cravings for this place even after moving out of state years ago|we dont have eat n park in illinois so when i first saw one i remarked to my sweetheart eat and parkdoesnt it make more sense to park first then eat yeah i know thats like a bad dad joke   but anyway to a foreigner like me eat n park is awesome    we only come here for brunch and since i aint got no job and limited funds its pretty awesome to enjoy a brunch for two for under   the unlimited house coffee is delicious and im not even a big coffee drinker more of a tea aficionado myself   another thing i dig about this place is even though theyre very much a meat and potatoes diner theyre really good about accommodating vegetarian diets  i like the smiles|the workers here are extremely friendly and the inside is absolutely beautiful  there is also a playful statue of the famous smiley mascot for people to see and take pictures with it  kids love smiley and so do i  they have so many great items on the menu to choose from that i have trouble deciding|this company represents a honest and caring company that cares about their community  they operate a variety of businesses and restaurants including the eat n park locations the new porch in shenley six and penn kitchen and the new upcoming hello bistro  i cannot wait to try all of their dinning places|i like this eatn park even though it is a chain not all of them are created equal the wait staff and kitchen staff really make a big difference in whether or not an eatn park is worth patronizing  eating here i change my mentality a bit i always order the seven dollar bbq burger with the salad bar add on for two dollars in my mind i always see myself ordering the seven dollar salad bar with a two dollar hamburger when the salad bar is kept stocked it has some really good and fresh items i love that they have spinach and not just iceburg lettuce i wish other eatn parks were more like this one|fow what it is this eat n park really is a lot better then i remember i also really like and approve of them offering healthier lower calorie option that have some variety and taste good|we had a really nice sunday brunch here today it exceeded my expectations which were admittedly very low we needed some healthy food options for our  year old as well as enough comfort food to satisfy our starving and lazy weekend bellies there was a short  minute wait for a table at around noon but the hostess was nice enough and they gave us a big clean booth with a partial view of the river it took another  minutes to get service although our waiter did pop by to say he would be right with us another waitress took our order in the end and they comped us for one buffet so the three of us ate for the price of one since kids five and under get a free buffet with a paying adult ok enough about the service which was slowish but its a full house at that time so understandable  the foodthe buffet was constantly refreshed and each container overflowing with hot food my favorites really well cooked fried chicken perfectly salted and complemented with franks red hot sauce biscuits and gravy the biscuits were a little dry mini peirogies cooked baby carrots really nice mini pancakes stuffing bacon and okonly home fries its too bad cos i generally judge a place by the quality of their breakfast potatoes but in this case the fried chicken more than made up for it my husband had some decent salad and good clam chowdamy kid ate everything on the other end of the buffet cherry tomatoes cottage cheese cooked baby carrots cantaloupe and honeydew melon pineapple bits of peirogie and chicken the waiter gave him a shamrock sugar cookie at the end of the meal we helped him eat most of it there were a few misses french toast were disappointingly dry and hard and the butteryoniony noodles were undercooked other things looked good but we couldnt try it all miniwaffles mash potatoes and gravy sausage patties cheesey sauce scrambled eggs well just have to go again in a few weekends alright folks dont need to run out and crowd it up but that fried chicken mmm mmm|always good food at a fair price its not gourmet but they have an amazing salad soup bar that would put most other places to shame great fresh food friendly service and desserts to go cant beat it|great location  i love that you can substitute burger with a veggi patti and that they have gluten free bread  love love love the smiley cookies |i like fast food as much as the next guy but i dont like these gimmick places the food was fine the service fine it was normal and affordable it was extactly what i thought it would be nothing went wrong everything turned out great|people may complain that the food is not high quality or the place is a bit messy but cmon it is a diner i have been going to eat n park ever since i was a little kid living in pittsburgh   years ago i moved to nj and now i go to school at pitt and it is still one of my favorite restaurants  whenever my family comes to visit i do not want to go to some fancy high end restaurant i always choose eat n park  the nicest service and greatest comfort food  they have one of the best salad bars and i also love their fried zuchinni strips and potato soap  be sure to grab the cinnamon buns to go as well as a smiley face cookie|from the last time i was here it was a complete oneeighty  our service was way above average in fact our waitress was amazing  she was attentive and even doted over my niece it felt great to be welcomed and accommodated this time aroundthis visit i was here with a bigger party than last time but that didnt stop us from receiving some of the best service i have ever had at an enp  food is standard especially if you are like me and enjoy the salad bar  its not the hugest salad bar but it has enough items on it to feel your stomach and then someoh and i rediscovered the grilled stickies  o m g  i forgot how much those ooey gooey grilled sticky buns of gold could be the perfect ending to a healthy meal |very good cheap food pittsburgh classicgreat desserts the oreo pie is amazing the servers are always very friendly the salad bar could be a little more clean|this is a stop i hit whenever i head to the waterfront its a pretty large store with lots of goodies yes it takes time to find things i like but thats what discount stores are about overall of all the tj maxxes ive been to from new mexico to boston this is a pretty good one|great variety and exceptional bargains from home decore to clothes and specialty foods and gadgets tj maxx has got you coveredits hardly ever crowded store is clean and check outs are quick|this tj maxx is quickly becoming a weekly stop for me the corporate team is definitely giving this store a lot of love with the product that they receive lately i havent been able to go into this store without spending at least  dangerousas you walk in handbags are the first thing you see last time i visited the store i was on a mission  coffee table decor  but was quickly sidetracked by a large briefcasesized black leather michael kors bag priced halfoff the suggested retail price so tempting but i forgot about this amazing bag when i stumbled upon two quality sweaters thirty seconds later one was design history which is a brand currently sold at nordstrom saks neimans and bluefly for only  i also found adrienne vittadini flats for  meri meri cupcake kits for  woodwick candles for  and a luxurious tahari throw blanket for  i walked out of the store minus  in my debit account with at least  of productive also been delightfully surprised by the cleanliness of the store and the fitting rooms and by the friendliness of the staff i was having an issue with my debit card while there and the two associates that i worked with were very helpful and understanding about the issueill definitely be going back in the next week or two to see what amazing new deals theyll have then|i enjoy this tj maxx location im not sure that any tj maxx in western pa has as good of a selection as the johnstown tj maxx yes thats right i really did say johnstown but this one is pretty close there is plenty of space and there is a decent homegoods section as well not huge but decentthis location always has a few bliss products which makes it top notch in my opinion i mean where else can you get discounted bliss productsi generally dont have a lot of success with shoes at tj maxx because they never seem that discounted to me but i have struck gold at this location several times last summer i scored two pairs of cole haan wedges for under  at the beginning of summer and ive had success with booties here as well great deals on shoes makes me a happy girlall in all this is a great location and one that i frequent at least a few times per month|decent size decent selection decent staffi guess that can wholly sum this place up its decent  as with many other stores that are like this the product rotates depending on what doesnt sale well at other stores  can always snag a deal here  i was able to pick up a pretty sweet puma jacket for  cant beat that rightthat being said there are those times that you may not find anything as well  so really dont get your hopes up if you are looking for a specific item|what i love about enp aside from the smiley face cookies is they have different things on the menu you dont find at bob evans and cracker barrel like vitamin water eggs benedict omelettes buffet healthier options  service was great|to me tj maxx means great items at a great price  they always have name brand handbags jewelry shoes and clothing at a great price you find shoes from coach clothes from calvin klein and jewelry from betsy johnson they have purses from michael kors  coach and kate spade plus many others its a great place to shop for items for your home be it bedding or cookware that you need plus they have great decorative items as well its a great place to not only shop for yourself but for gifts they have the best selection of frames around its all at great prices|love the place i could spend all day here and buy up everything i love the huge soap selection with decorative box for like  jewelry for the bathroom ill post pictures next time i just spent too much on other things  versace handbag retail at  for  and tommy hilfiger rain jacket retail   truly retail therapy heavenly experience recommend recommend recommend|no pictures  i knew i should have taken my cameramy aunt and i went there today for mothers day  i think we must have gotten the lunch menu because everything looked pretty cheap ive been to the one in columbus  my aunt had a chicken dinner grilled chicken green beans and potatoes with butter and i had their shanghai sampler which had a couple of shrimp a couple of scallops and a nice piece of salmon all done perfectly  we didnt order dessert since my aunt had made my favorite pumpkin pie  anyway dinner was great and so was the service thus the five stars|mtchells is one of the best fish places around  i really like their shanghi preparation of my fish its just deliciousthe establishment is always clean the staff courteous and the fish of course fresh  oddly enough one of my favorite things about going here besides the fish is the bread they give you  its always so warm and tastythe deserts are also very tasty  i have gotten two that i really likedthey also have a three course fixed price option last i went that was a great value i think it was person for lunch|this is one of the few restaurants i frequent in the waterfront why would you come to mitchells if not for the fishseafood you probably wouldnt but you can swim in the great lakes beer on tap here and have some nice oysters while enjoying river view not many places in pittsburgh offer these types of views while dining and thats a pittsburgh mystery to me the restaurant is never to crowded and you wont get packed in like sardines in a tin can so you can enjoy a fairly romantic dinner with your loved ones  the food is very good but you may have to shell out a few clams of your own  if you have deep ocean like pockets put your hook into the  sea bass which is always moist and scrumptious at around  they will cook your food one of several ways i like my fish broiled their signature is too salty for my liking bread is mmmgood and hot free staff is very  accommodating ie you can request to sample a soup and the servers are pleased to do so i recommend you try their soups like the seafood gumbo a bowl of this creamy delight goes a long waybonus they toss in those little hexagonal oyster crackers as  reminds me of my youth on long islands south shore but thats another story salads a bit skimpy and somewhat pricey approx  for basic house salad bottom line is mitchells at the waterfront is well worth taking the splash for if you really like a nice seafood dinner|an excellent choice for fresh well prepared seafood located in the waterfront area in homestead   i frequent this area for business travel and you cant do much better without heading downtownthe seafood is excellent with a daily menu crammed full of fresh fish specials a raw bar and a list of chefs specialties  the house salad is sweet and delicious and the shanghai seafood preparation is delicious healthy and unique  try it with the scallops or a whitefleshed fishthere is a nice selection of regional beers on tap a decent selections of wines and creative drinks think elderflower and pear martinis  the deserts are adequate though not a highlight  if youre on the waterfront you wont do better than this  enjoy|i was impressed  went here for lunch  the seafood gumbo was tremendous  i wasnt in the mood for more seafood so i had the chicken blt on ciabatta bread  im not sure what type of creamy sauce they put on the bread but it was delicious  will go back againthe food was reasonably priced for lunch  dinner would obviously be more expensive but i imagine its worth the |i did not know this is a franchise restaurant until i had looked it up on the internet this is the only restaurant i was not familiar with by the waterfront my mom and me sat on the outdoor patio the weather was very nice on a breezy summer day there was a great prix fixe special for  what a great price for regular portion saladthe dressing was too sweet for meentree and mini dessertthe fish was fresh my moms chilean sea bass shanghi style came with sticky rice and spinach the sea bass had nice texture and was reasonably priced my lobster and shrimp pappardelle had more shrimp than i expected my desert was creme brulee which was very good i love a good sugar coated dessert|a very nice meal in a very nice restaurantprosvery good foodinteresting choicesnot your typical red lobster crapgreat servicevery clean restrooms includedconsna|i took my cousin from california here for lunch we were both eating lite since a i was dieting and b my family was having dinner at my mothers house and she was slaving over lasagna all day so if anyone knows anything about italian mothers you better arrive hungry back to mitchells i had the iceberg wedge with bacon egg tomatoes and a delicious home made blue cheese dressing i also ordered a bowl of seafood gumbo which was the best gumbo i ever tasted it wasnt overly packed with rice as a matter of fact there wasnt much rice at all it was mostly shredded crab scallops and shrimp with a very delicate broth that wasnt too thick and the heat snuck up on you after swallowing it wasnt a lot of heat just enough to make it exciting as for the iceberg wedge salad every once in awhile i need a piece of iceberg instead of a bowl of spring mix ie tender weeds the star of this salad was the chef made blue cheese dressing it was not overly thick very tasty and savory it complimented the bacon and egg on the wedge the cousin ordered the carrot cake for dessert and it was easily a pound slice i tasted a little bite and must say its the best carrot cake ive ever tasted the cream cheese frosting was more buttery than cheesy it was a great surprise when youre expecting the normal cream cheese frosting there were whole walnuts throughout the cake and many raisins which i love also this recipe seems to rely on more cinnamon than ive tasted in the past i highly recommend it it was a wonderful lunch and im sure she had carrot cake to take on the plane ride back to riverside|finally i restaurant in pittsburgh that i can give  stars mitchells is located on the waterfront and is one of the nicer restaurants in that area the interior is a classic clean modern seafood restaurant dark wood glass etc the menu has really great seafood selections and is printed daily  but heres whats great about this place after pm you can get small plates at the bar for  each and these aint no costco fish sticks two of these small plates would make a sufficient meal along with the sourdough french bread they bring out finally while the drinks arent cheap theyre creative tasty and fresh all in all i had a great experience and i think this place would be perfect for a date or a happy hour with the girls from the typing pool|this place has great seafood the best in the area i come here for seafood every time everything on their menu is good their menu changes all the time depending on what was in season appetizers are amazing like the raw oysters  their clam chowder is the best really creamy with lots of clams wonderful restaurant you cannot go wrong with anything on the menu we love coming to this restaurant dont forget a reservation on weekends you will not get a table and will probably wait an hour or two if you dont have one we never get to the dessert always too full to eat dessert   forgot to take pictures|excellent service great meal  they had an excellent selection of seafood  and i cant wait to dine again|delightful after biking on the river trail that led us to the waterfront we zoomed past what looked like a wonderful patio situation at mitchells right on the river we parked our bikes and were seated promptly at the patio the waitress even filled our water bottles for us the interior of the restaurant is very nice seathemed and clean the decor is really tasteful and classy the outside was perfect it was sunday afternoon and the weather was gorgeous looking out to a serene part of the river is fabulous as well our waiter was professional knowledgeable and friendly we decided just on a few drinks and an app the two drinks my bf ordered were amazing the first muddled basil grapefruit juice and vodka i forget the name so refreshing the basil was flavorful and tasted awesome with the grapefruit juice the second he got was a frothy pineapplevodka with a huge fresh chunk of pineapple inside both were winners i stuck with a fairly priced white wine but got to test his fun drinks  the app we got was the hawaiian seared ahi tuna and it was delicious as well it was a pretty decent size to split and came with sushi rice a red onioncucumber relish ginger and wasabi i believe the tuna was also drizzled with ponzu it was so good  definitely recommend my bf couldnt help himself so he also ordered a cup of lobster bisque which i dont eat but he said it was very good he also polished off some of the warm bread loaf that accompanied our meal this place definitely earns the stars and i had no idea it was even a chain the waiter said they were expanding so hopefully the quality and service dont go down i also checked out the rest of the menu and they use quality ingredients and the prices really arent bad it was the lunch menu  im sure the dinner menu is pricier i felt like i was on vacation and ill definitely be back|this was a great find near pittsburgh alternative to down town scene ambiance was great on the deck by the river and service was excellent thanks melisa for history lessens seafood including oysters were fresh and well prepared price was reasonable for prefix menu including scrumptious dessert  what an evening to end a fantastic summer day in pittsburgh|very pleasant atmosphere fresh sea food not the frozen stuff they have great lunch specials too|drinks water for me yuengling for my fianceappetizers cup of maine lobster bisque for me  soo good my fiance had the new orleans seafood gumbo which i had a taste of it and it was good but i liked my soup bettervery rich and creamy but full of flavor with a fair amount of lobster bits mixed in the bread they served with the apps was fresh baked i believe sourdough and it was quite tasty along with the whipped butter our entrees came with house salads  had great elements but i felt i couldnt enjoy mine because the dressing given was a poppyseed vinagrette and i cant handle too much acidity in my food these days my fiance however cleaned his salad plate not a sentence i utter oftenentrees i had one of the specials grilled shrimp and scallops with roasted summer vegetables and tomato vinagrette which i asked for on the side the seafood part was great  the vegetables were soso my fiance had the special of cod stuffed with lobster and some other seafood with asparagus and a lemony sauce  i had a taste of his and it was really yummy ill def order that next time we both finished our plates which wasnt too challenging bc the portions were moderate i got   srhimp and  scallops for example but still fillingdessert didnt order anyservice friendly though a little sparse after we finished our meals we felt like we were waiting around for awhile before we could ask for our check but our server was overall friendly and we didnt feel neglected or anythingdealsdiscounts noneoverall we liked the variety and freshness of seafood def a place wed consider going to again which is the main mark of a very good experience|we went here for valentines day after some traffic downtown made us miss our reservation somewhere else we both loved it the calamari is outstanding and if you get there before  they run happy hour which is half off apps and  beers i had filet and crab cake and it was delicious the steak was cooked perfectly and the crabcake was a good size atmosphere was good and busy but that is likely because of it being valentines day despite the busyness the wait staff was very attentivemy wifes steak came out rare despite asking for medium but they took it back and recooked it to a perfect medium level we will def be back|went on a saturday  hour wait food is good i got some seafood gumbo to go and i wont do that again seemed like it didnt have any seafood in it|the service is great and friendly i got the baked spinach and artichoke dip and it was superb i love the fresh right out of the oven bread too i got the atlantic salmon and it was probably the best fish i have ever tried listened to other yelpers suggestion of the shang hai preparation and they were right just make sure you make a reservation best seafood restaurant in da burgh|service was slow but that was because one of our party insisted that the bartender her favorite server serve us in our private room for a party of   the food and drinks were good and we woud return|good foodyummy|had the blackened fish tacos the were very good along with a pint of guinness recommended|first off i have to note their maine lobster bisque is amazing definately dont miss out on it that being said we had lunch there and the lunch portions are a good value i had the cedar plank salmon the fish was fantastic except that the vegetables were a little bland the atmosphere at the restaurant is quite relaxed and i dont think ive ever seen it get more than mildly busy in there so it is a nice place to go to have a quiet meal with someone special|absolutely delicious wonderful service|food was excellent went for the sunday brunch and loved it i highly recommend the steak and eggs with the zucchini pancakes really an outstanding dish oh and if you get the carrot cakeone is enough for everyone it was huge and it was soooo goood i dont know how they can make something taste that good and cook it in such large volumes really was an excellent experience my only reason for not giving it a five star review was that there was too much time in between our courses there was probably a good  minutes that passed between our salads and our entrees thats a little long for me when im at a brunch usually i dont eat a breakfast if im going to something like that so  minutes was too long for me|very very good chain family restaurant i had their yellowfin tuna steak shanghai style and it was great service was excellent and the party of  i was with swore they could eat there every week as the menu was extremely diverse its hard for me to give a chain  but this is pretty close|love this place  they were very accommodating to me peanut and gramma she goes often  solid wine selection and gramma says they make a good margarita  we all enjoyed all of our food as well  great view of the mon too|beautiful decor very genuine staff very clean washrooms delicious food i tried the market trio the blackened tilapia was nice with a little bit of spice this is a great place for a seafood lover|amazing valentines dinner and service curt was simply a wonderful server and the food was fantastic only negative was a few overly salted bites but as someone who is a salt minimalist that could purely be my palate only|the tuna was enjoyable and the service was prompt the house chardonnay was buttery and was a good compliment to the fish it was a tuesday night so the place was busy but not crowded since i wasnt wowed by the place i wont give it  stars but i had no dissatisfaction to speak of i will be back if im not across the street at the rock bottom brewery|my husband and i went to mitchells last summer for our wedding anniversary we both took a half day at work and we arrived in the early afternoon after lunch but before the dinner crowd i cant say enough about this placewe have gone here on a few occasions and ive always been please with everything pros nice friendly waitress who took some time to take our picture since it was our anniversary food was excellent and not extremely overpriced restaurant and bathrooms were cleancons none on this visit or any previous visits|love this place so much the food is always so delicious always leave feeling extremely satisfied the service is incredibly slow though takes forever to our meals even during lunch time when theres almost no one there i dont understand i always end up eating here for at least twofour hours fish is always fresh lobster is delicate and tasty and surprisingly the steak is amazing as well clam chowder is rich and creamy perfect thickness love their salads as well definitely recommend this place for a date night  pricey definitely be prepared to spend at least person|first i would like to say that i was hesitant coming to another fish place recommended by some temporary coworkers since the last place they sent me to made terribly ill that being said i came here and was delighted by my server michael who was not only friendly but incredibly attentive and very sharp i originally ordered the mahi mahi but alas the ran out upon my ordering in which case the manager promptly came to ask me for another upgraded selection at no additional charge hence the tuna now the tuna was amazing seared almost perfectly with the rare flavor still intact i would most definitely come back again and if i lived in the area this would be one of my top spots|good quality food here the clam chowder was excellent and so was the tuna appetizer and the americana seafood plate loaded with shrimp and scallops in a creamy spinach sauce with small potatoes id go here again if possible|the patio view is beautiful and the food is good too we ordered the grill rainbow trout shang hai rainbow trout crispy ginger cod  rainbow trout everyone is happy about the dish they have music every thursday it is a little bit loud but the band is really good will come again|went for dinner friday evening with friends and sat at the outdoor patio it is so nice and relaxing there with the river and bike trail the sourdough bread they serve is always hot and fresh the chilean sea bass just melts in your mouth it was awesome the cod stuffed with shrimp and lobster was also very good i had the carrot cake for dessert it is big enough for  people it was so delicious my friend had the creme  brle which she said was very good i was here  times this summer and every meal was excellent|mitchells is located on the river side of the waterfront and out of the crazy lets fight to find a parking spot area  they do take reservations but doubtful you need one on a weekday during lunch  it wasnt busy when i was there on a tuesday at noonmitchells has a cool layout  large full bar in the middle private large rooms for large parties smaller areas for business lunches full dining room seating with tables and booths and an excellent outdoor patio where you can watch people ride by on the bike trail  this is a seafood restaurant with lots of good options for fresh in season fish  you can choose from a number of different fish to have prepared for salads sandwiches or just as they are  i had the chopped salad and added scallops to it  delicious  the price range is reasonable and you can plan on spending around  with your lunch and a sodaiced tea  for that price you really cant complain  i drop almost that much at panera on a half sandwich and cup of soup with an iced tea  im sure its much busier for dinner but i find mitchells to be an excellent place for a business lunch or just meeting friends  ive been here for brunch as well and had an excellent bloody mary and eggs benedict with crab|have been here a few times the wait staff is always top notch and food is very good i had the steak and lobster tail steak was a perfect medium rare and the lobster was also cooked well oysters as an app they appeared fresh and tasted how they should overall like in the past we had a great experience at mitchells which is not something i always expect from a chain|my family and i go here whenever there is a special occasion and for good reason the food is fantastic and the service cannot be beat at least not when its coming from the governor or kennedy best servers in the burgh i took my dad there last weekend for his th birthday didnt tell anyone that it was a special night out but they treated us with such attention accommodating our needs to a t kennedy adjusted meals to fit our taste suggested things based on what we were looking for took at least  minutes with us going over the menui could go on but needless to say it was just a fabulous meal and was worth every penny we got the king crab and bacon wrapped shrimp to start lobster bisque soup cedar plank salmon chilean sea bass and a fish medley made to order we also always get the  layer carrot cake which to me is the best cake anywhere in town  a must go for anyone looking for an amazing meal and excellent service but be sure and ask for kennedy hes a real dude|excellent fresh seafood good vegetables good service best place to eat on waterfront|i went to this restaurant last week with my husband and my family the restaurant is located on the waterfront area the variety of fish was excellent including the fresh fish of the day i ordered the atlantic cod and it was deliciousthe waitress service was really good i definitely recommend this restaurante|a okreally loved the bacon wrapped shrimp so amazing with the sauce on the side this was probably the the best part of the meal  i also had blacken salmon with a double order of spinach instead of a starch the spinach was just steamed without any flavoring which is better in the long run  but i wish they had options for sauteed with garlic the service was great as well  we were always taken care of  will definitely bring my bf here in the future|this was my first time at this location  ive frequented the upper st clair galleria restaurant  theres a lot to like about this columbus oh based chain  i dont usually eat at chain restaurants nor will i review them because theyre typically big food corporate run places that dont care what they feed you they just care about their stockholders  this place seems different to me  the food quality and care seems to be very high  the staff is always well trained  i like the decor and ambiance  the menu offers many options  i dont really like the fish preparation options very much and the portions can be small in some of the dishes but overall i am a fan  i do really appreciate being able to buy fresh fish here  i like to buy the trout and prepare it at home  we were here for a thanksgiving meetup event with  other people  the room was a little small and it ended up being too loud too but the staff really pulled it off overall  its a tough thing to do  it wasnt perfect for sure but the food was surprisingly good and came out hot and fresh  nicely done|in the homestead area of pittsburgh seafood gumbo was very goodbroiled scallops were very good partner had sea bass stuffed with lobster also very good vegetable sides were not as good as the fish with two glasses of wine the total was  in and out in an hourid go back because the fish was that good|my husbands first time  nice to be able to pick your fish and style of cooking  i had a trio of jamaican jerk tilapia  salmon  and scallops  all good but too much sauce on scallops  husband had surf n turf special snow crab legs tasty but smaller portion than i expected glad they had raw oysters  but no idea where they were from  for  each youd think theyd say  waitstaff friendly but inexperienced when it came to wine  we taught two of them how to open a champagne bottle  nice time out  but two gripes  used my phones flashlight to see if there was an outlet on the floor  felt like an archaeologist finding old remains of dinners gone by  crumbs  napkins wedged between booth and wall  gum  dirt  for the price i would expect a cleaner place  our waiter kept saying thank you after every single sentence  even when it wasnt appropriate  silly gripe  right  but it was way over the top and felt more like  can i have a tip  can i have a tip|good one of my favorite restaurants in pittsburgh went yesterday with family and enjoyed oystersvery fresh i always like appetizers more than their entrees|one of our favorite special occasion restaurants five stars for atmosphere we enjoy the patio and the dining room the food is superb and the service is also very good birthday and anniversary desserts on the house but no hassles like singing or incessant questions about the reason for your visit one pointer dont go on valentines without a reservation but the same is true everywhere|so yes i went there the meal was good i would love to say i would go back but i doubt it|unlike some other reviewers here that came to a fish market looking for vegan food and didnt like it who would have guessed    i came here to eat fish and it was delicious i had atlantic salmon on special with chili citrus glaze that turned out awesome we also ordered cedar plank trout which didnt disappoint either overall a real good first seafood experience for this place id have loved to give them  stars but id hold that till they add some nice local beers|there really are not too many seafood options here in pittsburgh i have been here  times so far and each time has been very good this last friday i walked in and i was able to be seated immediately without a reservation it was about  when we went in and at about pm when we left it was pretty packed the seafood has always been good and fresh and this was the first time in my life that i had swordfish and it was moist and tasty they have a signature way of steaming their fish if you ask for it this way with ginger sesame seeds and soy sauce over spinach and rice it is excellent they have a full bar with a few good drafts guiness and dogfish  definitely pricey among the waterfront restaurants but to me it is worth it|it depends on what you order here as this can be a reasonable meal or a splurge they have some delicious tilapiatroutsalmon entrees with veggie and starch in that sweet spot of  however if you want you could easily go  a plate the spinach salad with chevre and roasted pecans was awesome wine was surprisingly reasonable and they were food allergy friendlybetter than red lobster and not nearly as busy as pf changs or bravoso you might be able to walk inwould give a  if i could|i love mitchells fish market   of the time the food is amazing but when they mess up they move heaven and earth to make it better  the last time we were at mitchells i ordered the lobster and tenderloin skewers  my lobster was underdone  the server was amazing and replaced the lobster tail even though i had eaten most of it  then to make our night even better comped us a dessert  its that kind of stellar service that keeps us going back|i really like this placenice ambiance  the food is well seasoned and the seafood is fresh  the wait staff is particularly good|i took my daughter here for lunch she had been wanting to come for a good while shes graduating high school next week so it seemed like the perfect time she had the clam chowder and the shrimp scampi it was great she wished that the chowder was slightly thinner but enjoyed the alfredolike flavor i was not in the mood for seafood so i had the bacon cheeseburger you cant go wrong with a burger right well let me tell you that was one of the best burgers that ive had and i frequent restaurants who specialize in them it had a beautiful char flavor to it i did not need any condiments the broccoli i had was wonderful as well and i especially enjoyed the seasoningthe only thing that slightly sullied it for me is that it was too dark i love atmosphere but i was almost asleep before the food came out|they were so accommodating for my daughter that doesnt like seafood the food and service was very good|after doing some chores at the waterfront we were hungry and decided to try mitchells for dinner we were seated at a comfortable red booth the clam chowder was perfect definitely get it the mussels were deliciousnot as firm as mussels usually are but in a good way and bigger than normal the spicy crispy shrimp surprised me i didnt think it would be good but it was boyfriend said his lobster bisque was funky and i agreed that it tasted weird but it was still edible the calamari however was unseasoned maybe they forgot to season it that night i feel like the way it was served to us is not the way they usually serve it also i was disappointed with the small portion of the calamari for  we should be getting way more than we did our server was attentive and noticed that we liked a lot of their appetizers so she informed us about their happy hour monday through friday pm where their appetizers are at most  each tempting especially after our pleasant dinner experiencetaste  atmosphere  presentation  service  overall  |so ive never been here before i came with a friend and her aunt the place is decorated really well a little dim though even the bathroom is really really dim like i get the atmosphere youre trying to go for but i want to be able to seei got the seafood stew and it was so good the scallops were perfectly cooked and the flavor of the broth was fantastic my shrimp were over cooked though thus the four star review they got everything right but that one thing kinda tainted iti had the banana bread pudding for dessert and that was also very good ive had a lot of bread pudding and this was one of the best it was light but also dense and the flavor of the banana came through very clearlyoverall i had a very good experience it would have been very great if it werent for the over cooked shrimp id definitely go back but it is pretty pricey|i love old navy clothing its vintage styling with good prices great jeans too i love the painters jeans|i hadnt been shopping at old navy for at least a year or two recently a friend of mine told me that she loved their new fallholiday collection so i popped by based on her recommendation i absolutely love their winter outerwear they have a lot of beautiful coats this year for amazing prices and i just had to pick up two only  for both with their current saleoutside of their current product i was impressed by the size of the store which seems a bit larger than average though it is a lot of square footage to cover i was not impressed by their sales floor customer service yes its old navy but i shopped in this store three times over the past week and did not have anyone come up to me while wandering around the outerwear however the woman that assisted me in the fitting room had a great attitude and i really enjoyed interacting with heroverall a four star old navy experience if they could work on their customer service skills on the sales floor id give them a five|this store is laid out better than any other old navy ive been to before  it was so easy to quickly find everything we were looking for  the staff was also very friendlyif only all old navy stores were like this one|underated and ignored  if you see this ol time pizzaria near kennywood stop on by good crust nice and buttery in the sicilian style  better then disallas  the only thing i can say that is better then latinas is mineos   they say the best pizzarias are the little holes in the wall type places and this is one of those enviroments  small and cozy very nice and relaxing afternoon  to just enjoy with yourself and a friend|good pizza at a great price the unique crust thats both crispy and airy is probably not for everybody but our whole group liked it the sauce is good too light but with a good tomato flavor the best thing about this place is the management they went out of their way for our group of seven and the food was out fast and the prices we fed everybody in under  with plenty of leftovers taken home|i have to admit the first time i hate here i absolutely hated the pizza and i think it was because i was expecting something completely different than i got latina pizza is very different from most pizza shops instead if a round thin crust pizza this pizza is square thick and doughy the crust is not really that good but that is not why you get a pizza here its the homemade sauce and that it is a family owned place that is  really pretty inexpensive the other nice thing about this shop is that it is right next to kennywood so usually around dinnertime we leave the park and walk over here to order some pizzas and drinks no lines no waiting for tables no outrageous prices its a time to recharge and sometimes we feel like going back to the park  other times we decide to go home|this is the best bike store ive walked into  their primary focus is on racing bikes but as im not a racer the service stays top notch in much lower price rangesgot greeted by the staff and my girlfriend and i got the luxury of absolutely no pressure as we walked around and looked at bikes  she explained what she was looking for and the staff explained what they had and what price range she was looking at  i wound up talking to another person working there and let them try to find a bike that fit  im  and as i found out fit pretty well on an xxl scott cm frameanyways back to my girlfriends experience  what impressed me was after they had a bike they thought was a winner they let her go on a test ride around the neighborhood there  and then when she came back in two minutes told her that wasnt ideal and sent her back out with instructions to take the second left and try it on a hill  after she figured out yes that was the bike the guy spent at least half an hour fitting the bike to her he wound up switching out the stem adding a seat with a little more travel and getting everything just so  there was no hurry  there was no pressurethe amount of interest that the staff showed in getting each person the justso fit gets five stars if you want a bike that fits its worth it to browse hereand update i went out the other day and asked for a price on a bike costing about  of the bike i tooled around on there two weeks ago  without batting an eye and without a hint of bike snobbery the owner ran off to figure out what itd cost me  i talked to him about the differences between a double and triple and he spent twenty minutes explaining the pros and cons and gave a strong suggestion on the double  that said the price he quoted me was also  under the price quoted by another shop on the same exact bike  i asked for the price of an upgrade to a single part on the new bike and he quoted me about half the price i expected from doing research on the internet  customerfriendly well priced superhighquality bicycles  aedit  years later glen beth and the rest of the crew here are still there and still awesome  my girlfriend is now my wife  my lowend trek road bike now has more miles on it  its still a much longer drive to get to big bang but for any work on my bike im glad to make the drive  friends have terrific luck with pittsburgh pro which is nearer  and ill occasionally stop there on a ride that said for dropoffthebike work big bang is my absolute goto|this is the best experience ive had at a bike store in the pittsburgh area  i have been shopping around for a couple months for a new road bike which was going to be my first road bike ever meaning that im fairly clueless about how to pick one out  also since im a student i dont have particularly deep pocketsat big bang i was greeted basically the moment i walked in the door  im kind of shy when i know that i dont really know what im doing but i wasnt pressured or harassed in any way by the staff  even though my price range was pretty low they still tried their hardest to find a bike that suited my needs and they found a bike that fitted me perfectly and gave me an excellent deal on the price  they take a lot of care to make sure youre properly fitted to the bikealso this is one of the few bike stores ive been to where test riding is gleefully encouraged rather than grudgingly allowed  definitely its the only bike store where theyll tell you you havent tried it out enough go climb up the hill on  it  they definitely put the

at no cost to me  i had my bike back in a couple days no muss no fussmy husband got a used road bike from craigslist and we brought it in for a tuneup  the bike had several things wrong with it due to a shoddy assembly job and bbb basically took the entire bike apart and rebuilt it cleaning it and replacing various wornout bits  i cant remember the total cost of this but it was under i would totally recommend bbb due to their general awesomeness  i havent had any of the tuneuprelated woes that other people have had with this shop even when bringing in a bike that i havent bought there|i

in about half an hour before closing was not rushed at all i basically just walked in and said i was interested in a road bike but knew very little about them im a mtbr i was helped by glenn who within two minutes had me sitting on a bike measuring me and adjusting things and explaining the physics behind positioning and angles and the difference between the male and female physique on a road bike at no point did he try to upsell anything in fact he didnt even ask me about a budget he just gave me a few things to think about before i invest in something new he was very obviously focused on getting me the product that will give me the most efficiency and power for my needs so very impressedthis is absolutely where i will be buying my bike|i am a novice rider looking to customize my bike and very intimidated to walk into the shop glen and the staff answered all of my questions and made it so easy to make my riding experience more comfortable i would recommend this shop to bicyclist of any experience level|my experience at big bang bicycles was what i have been looking for in the western pa area i have been looking for trusted advice concerning a new road bike and proper fitting during the purchase process  i am  and i found out quickly that regardless of the time of the year it was very difficult to find a shop which stocked bikes of quality that i could properly test ride  big bang and owner glenn couldnt have been more patient of all my questions and concerns  his knowledge is remarkable and he took his time fitting me and explaining the process he had several bikes i could demo in my size  after deciding on a model to order glenn craig and samson who i had the pleasure of working with continued to help me through ordering the bike getting it assembled upon delivery and taking a significant amount of time going through the bike with me and how to maintain it properly the shop has an amazing variety of helmets clothing and other things that a cyclists

are well worth the trip|this place is a gem always helpful high quality and great workmanship this is a great bike shop for any level of rider|ive lived in  cities before coming to pittsburgh and i have not received service anywhere better than this place their prices and selection are unparalleled elsewhere in the city the mechanics are certainly the best and the beuty about this place is they treat everybody with utmost respect  i was treated like i was a pro day  even though i am novice in every sense of the wordmy only gripe initially was the location but after coming here several times i understand why this is the mecca of bicycles not only in pittsburgh but whole western pa keep up the good work guys|ive ridden trained on andor raced bicycles for  years and during that time ive purchased bikes andor parts from no less than  different shops and websites so it is with a great deal of experience that i can say with confidence that this is the best shop ive ever stepped foot or cleat in i purchased a new bike and had  other bikes serviced there in a short period of time glenn craig and the entire team effectively demonstrated technical expertise a passion for the sport and most importantly a deep respect for their customers i not only witnessed it myself but witnessed it with other customers while i was waiting whether youre new to the sport or a long time cyclist seeking a new and better experience there simply is no better shop than big bang their selection access and overall service is simply unreal enjoy this place its a treat|what you havent been to bellisarios yet this is about the only red sauce pizza i ever get a craving for and boy howdy is it good the crust is on the thin side and ever so crisp on the bottom while still having enough dough on the edge to provide a nice chewy bit at the end of your slice the dough itself is flavorful not too well doughy the sauce is great and they dont drown the pizza in it theres just enough cheese not so much its an overwhelming grease slick and not so little you cant tell its there if you can go while mamas working all the betteryou can eat in here they have four or five booths and generations worth of family photos on the walls two of us split a small cut pizza with one topping  and with our two cans of pop we were out for  you cant beat that and id put bellisarios pizza up against any in the cityi grew up a five minute walk away my mom loved bellisarios and i have a lot of fond memories of walking through the alley to pick up a cheese pizza to bring home my mom being too dollarconscious to pay for delivery when there were perfectly ablebodied children around to go pick it up every time i have a slice it brings back great memories but ive had outside confirmation that it really is as awesome as i think it isits a little divey stuck in the back of an old shopping plaza but its perfect if youre in west mifflin say going to kennywood drive over and eat a pizza theyve also got hoagies and calzones and i think thats about it but with pizza this good who cares|i have been looking for  years for good crab rangoon  i finally found it  we had boneless ribs that were absolutely wonderful  definitely going back|ok this is my first yelp review i never left any reviews for other restaurants but i am writing it because i want others to know about this place

are visiting kennywood you should definitely try this place|love this place run by family best general tsos around and when i walk in they call me mr spicy|lets look past the fact that its not an ambient authentic chinese atmosphere lets look at the value and the flavor and the fact that theres not much if any competition in the areavalue is great they offer several free items if you purchase certain dollar amounts of food and you get a lot of food for the price you paythe flavor was great i had general tsos my wife had chicken fried rice and my son had sweet  sour chicken no complaints we all enjoyed it and even had leftoversyou can eat there but its what i call quick service or counter style order at the counter and you sit down no one will be waiting on you refilling your ice water every five minutes this isnt a deal breaker besides you get your food in about  minutes and its hot and deliciouscompetition there honestly isnt any the next closest place by comparison is either china buffet in century square or pf changs and i dont want buffet and i dont want to pay an arm and a leg for some simple chinese food further out its either silk road sesame inn or china town inn and it will take you forever to get to those places than you care to endurehunan wok   stars|great food service and prices its in a not so great part of town but lock your doors and its definitely worth it best baked goods in the area try the almond torte|thanks to darrens sis jessica we had some excellent cookies for our housewarming party i liked ths sugar cookies with the jimmies best and

nothing ive tasted holds a candle to minervas|you have never had a pierogie until youve driven out to mckees rocks and picked up a dozen or so from pierogies plus made primarily by polish and ukranian immigrants these are probably the most authenticdelicious pierogies you can buy in the states if the only pierogies youve ever had were the frozen mrs ts you got at giant eagle do yourself a favor and check pierogies plus out|in pittsburgh there is no other place to get pierogies everything is made by hand fresh every day and the mix of languages while you wait is a real treat there are over  kinds of pierogies and now that they have expanded there are a variety of salads and some desserts available too dont forget about the haluski and stuffed cabbage theyve been on the food network with bobby flay food finds dave  dave from wqed and in numerous newspaper articles you wont find anything more authentic or delicious as this place and they ship too|years after the first reviewer came here the quality is still great and deserving of more than  starsthe people who work here and run this place are super friendly and really know their craft the main owner took my order once and gave me some tips on how to cook the frozen pierogies at home they turned out ok but not as good as getting them fresh from the store it can be a bit of a drive from anywhere thats not mckees rocks google maps takes you through the hood but its worth it|these are the best pierogies ever  my favorite is the jalapeno pierogie which is not that spicy but has excellent flavor  it is such a treat to get these when im back in town|love butter then get thee to pierogies plusi live in st louis and it seems like the only pierogi i can find are in my grocers freezer oh but when i go home to pittsburgh i can have as much of the chewy flavorful buttery goodness as i desire from pierogies plusthe place still looks like an old service station with a tiny building and a roof over an old gas pump island inside though magical elves uh i mean fabulous polish women create deliciousness with love  and butter have i mentioned that butter is a part of the deal because it totally is you really should fast for two days before picking up pierogi from hereoh but youll be happy you did im vegetarian so i only order meatfree pierogi im in love with the saurkraut and the cheese varieties when you pick up a hot order youll get your pierogi covered in with rich butter and sauteed onions no im serious  the pierogi are swimming in butter its the best thing ever everything is packed inside a styrofoam container and a plastic bag because butter will spill outyou also can order cold or frozen pierogi if you plan to say lug them to the middle of the country to enjoy in a faroff citybesides many varieties of pierogi you also can get things from the deli cases last time i had some apricot blintzes a latke and some type of apple turnover thingy i really hope pierogies plus has the blintzes when i visit nextawesome thing pierogies plus usually has coupons in the entertainment book my best friend and i steal all of the coupons from our families so that i can get a steady stream of discounted polish goodness each time i visitthe only downside is that pierogies plus often closes for several days around holidays i totally understand it  family time is important  but that often coincides with my visits i head east around the holidays mainly because i get an extra day with the fam without having to take another vacation day ive learned to plan my trips around the pierogies plus schedule though because i must have yummy goodness a pierogiless allison is a cranky allison|these pierogies are one of my favorite things in the world theyre freakin amazing the potato and jalapeno ones are my favorite and i definitely think its worth it to drive all the way out to mckees rocks to get them i like to get them frozen and bring them home and smother them in butter|i was planning to attend a conference in pittsburgh and was researching food joints that i wanted to check out a friend of mine insisted that i go to pierogies plus telling me that the food was so good that ever since he went that he has had pierogies mailordered to his house each year while i have never been a huge fan of pierogies i figured that i should heed my friends advice since he generally steers me to places i enjoy lets just say in this case he hit the ball out of the parki actually wound up going to pierogies plus straight from the airport after getting in a rental car and plugging in my gps imagine my surprise when my gps announced you have reached your destination and i found myself sitting outside what appeared to be an old service station when i walked inside and up to the counter i found a crew of polish women rocking out every kind of pierogi imaginable i was overwhelmed by the sheer volume of choiceswanting to try everything i wound up going with their sampler platter  which was a small haluski a noodle and cabbage mixture a stuffed cabbage and four pierogi  i wound up going with a potato with bacon potato with cheese potato with jalapeno and potato with meat the food was outrageously good im actually salivating just thinking back on the meal the stuffed cabbage was not marred by the typical dryness that can afflict that dish and was perfectly sauced the haluski a dish i had never heard of was amazingwhile i cant expect everyone to make their way to pittsburgh solely to go to pierogies plus do yourself a favor and order some those wonderful ladies deserve your business your belly will appreciate it|little ladies sitting in the back of a renovated gas station perched precariously at the top of a hill making pierogies and cooking them to perfection in butter and onions it almost sounds like a strange pittsburgher fairy tale but this is no tale  the finest pierogies ive ever eaten emerge from the back of that gas station and my polish girlfriend even confirmed that these are better than some of her familys goodswhile in line i met folks from rhode island kentucky and north carolina who all had come to mckees rocks in their rental cars straight from the airport before even going to see their families  that is dedication and commitment to some seriously delicious pierogies after enjoying a dozen of these filling savory perfect pierogies i think once i move away from here i will be making that same trip to pierogies plus myself|update get the italian sausage pierogies holy crap it will change your freaking life|my coworkers and i left our office in crafton headed for pierogies plus the journey there took us past bizarre abandonedlooking buildings and roads that suddenly ended in cement blockades the area is prime for use as the setting of a slasher flick but the weird drive is totally worth it pierogies plus is so legit the setting is reminiscent of seinfelds soup nazi tiny interior people standing in line shouldertoshoulder and a lady behind the counter brusquely taking orders oh and make sure you order your rogies hot if youre planning on eating them soon otherwise you get em frozen theres a slight upcharge for the hot ones btw  electricity aint free they were out of the plain potato and the potato and cheese varieties when we were there so i had the platter with pierogies and kielbasa i opted for the sauerkraut pierogies and they were so good the interior was filled with sauerkraut mixed with potatoes as opposed to many other sauerkraut pierogies ive had that were filled with only kraut i definitely prefer the potatokraut mix they were also drowning in butter and onions like serious serious butter  paula deen has nothin on these ladies butter usage the kielbasa was awesome too i also sampled their haluski and it was the best ive ever had tons o butter seasoned with generous amounts of salt n pepper and there was quite a bit of sauted onions in the mix which added even more flavor a few things to note they have coupons you can print out on their website but you must cut them out if youre gonna bring em in and use them you cannot just hand them the whole piece of paper if you want to order a special variety they need  days advance notice check their site to see what the special ones are they do accept credit cards with a  min yes some of the ladies are not the friendliest but the food is so good they can be like that and youll still come back for more  and parking is quite limited there pretty sure the building is a converted service station all in all these pierogies are some of the best ive ever had and i will definitely be back very soon|omg good pierogis in a classic blue collar hood at first glance it looks like a place to get a flat fixed on your tire instead i relearn why i always avoid the corporate food franchises and seek places like this out just go there and eat whatever the nice woman behind the counter tells you to its well worth the mapquest |as a skeptical out of towner i was pretty wary after the hotel bellhop suggested this off the beaten path place however this place far exceeded my expectations we bought an assorted dozen of pierogies and they were all delicious my favorites being the jalapeos pierogi and the baconpotato pierogi  a great find and an excellent place for someone out of town to try out pierogies|some great pierogies are expertly handmade with tender loving care here in this oncewasagasstation quality i tell you theyre definitely worthy of a pierogi pilgrimage order them hot if you want them right then and there because these nice ladies also sell them cold to take home too hot and buttery buttery buttery and covered in sauteed onions is how youll get them so good we shared the potato and cheese potato and sauerkraut and hot sausage varieties delicious them all|just finished a dinner of pierogies that our pgh family brought to wv  always look forward to pierogies plus  try the apricot for a sweet treet|best pierogies in tahn  i usually just go with the standard potato and cheese but ive also tried a few of the other pierogies and some of the plus  these pierogies cant be beat  made by hand with love in the traditional old world style i have yet to find betterits amazing to get there at am  minutes before they open and see the mad rush of people getting pierogies  by am the line is already out the door  always a good sign  they serve their pierogies hot cold or frozen  i always go with the hot because nothing beats pierogies bathing in butter and onions  and here at pierogies plus they are definitely worth the wait|apricot with cream cheese who would have thoughtlove this place love it so much  print the  off coupon on their website before going in   make sure u print it out they will not accept it other wise|this place has some amazing homemade pierogies i had never eaten anything besides the usual mrs ts potato types and boy was i missing out we stopped one night and got a some potatocheddar and some sauerkrautpotato you can buy them hot or take them home cold there is a small table outside to eat but only standing room to order insidethey had special order pierogies that sounded amazing but they suggest a  day advance order for those they said sometimes they will have leftover specialty ones for sale but it all depends on the day they also have haluski stuffed cabbage and other things that i am looking forward to trying next time|this little former gas station makes some incredibly delicious pierogies order ahead for big holidays  we order several dozen every year for easter and the take out line stretches out the door all day on good friday i particularly like the apricot and cream cheese and the prune varieties potato and cheddar are great too of course|my mother is  years old and now lives in new york but she grew up outside of pittsburgh  her parents were czech and our annual vacations to visit my grandparents were wonderful  filled with family dinners including stuffed cabbage peirogies and haluski  now that my mother is older and lives alone making things like stuffed cabbage is difficult for her  i saw peirogies plus featured on the food network years ago and decided to send my mom an assortment for her birthday  when her package arrived she called me immediately and said where did you get this food  this is the real deal  traditional authentic ethnic food  the gift i sent took my mother back to her own mothers kitchen  its the comfort food to beat all comfort foods  it also takes me back to my childhood all those summers ago  im ordering again for my mothers birthday  the only problem now is that i have to order enough to include my brothers and sisters who mysteriously show up at my mothers house once the rumor that the package has arrived makes the rounds|warning addicting potatoe version of crack cheap frozen cold or hot  parking sucks on busy route  mckees rocks only enough room for approx  cars super busy best time to come is between pmpmg food  outside in good weather there is a couple little tables to sit at but not during the winterearly spring  most customers are to go take home  hours monday  tuesfriday     closed

made to order regardless when i received my food it was streaming hot lets just say for me it was worth the wait|best pierogies ive ever had  and seeing as how im from pittsburgh thats a lot  the apricot and cream cheese pierogies are amazing  go|good pierogies but after also having szmidts in greenfield recently this place takes the backseat its also out of the way for me however if i ever happen to be in mckees rocks ill make sure to keep this spot in mind|great food  i have been eating at pierogies plus since they opened  great food all around  the halupki and halushki are awesome as well as the pierogies|we went way out of our way on a long road trip to stop here and it was worth it its just one of those funky little neighborhood spots that does a great job at its specialty ordering was a little awkward but we got through it we didnt mind sitting in the crappy little outdoor seating areait was better than getting back in the car|good food great staff  always friendly always clean very consistent   the breakfast sandwich is awesome|food here was pretty comparable to other eat n parks my boyfriend and i came here late at night he ordered soup and props to the waitress for being honest and telling him not to get it that it had been sitting all day and was soggy we really appreciated the waitress being upfront about what to not order late at night overall a good experience|the hamburgers and fries taste better than other eat n parks i have eaten at i dont know why maybe a different food distributor clean  the service is good|have been here two times after stopping at mancinis bakery have only had the hamburgercheesebacon w fries but huge portions and great price great quality also server is really nice also will be eating here again heard the breakfast items are also great saw the waffles and pancakeswere huge|marges is tucked away in the delightful pittsburgh neighborhood of mckees rocks this place reminds me half of a diner from the s and half my grandmas kitchenthe seating room is accommodation the service prompt and courteousthe prices are fantastic and so is the foodi had a grilled hodge podge combination of hotsweet sausage potatoes eggs and peppers all on one dish for  it was excellent ladies and gents i can put food away  like a champ and i still had leftoversmy friend had a succulent buttery french toast simple but they nailed iti would return|great service great food at a reasonable price  the cheeseburger was as big as my head and delicious and the onion rings were just as good  our waitress was friendly attentive and quick to refill drinks cant wait to go back|on a random sunday morning i went in search of a good breakfast spot  i decided to explore the mckees rocks neighborhood and came upon marges place  i hadnt heard much about this place but after reading the few reviews i could find i decided to give it a try  inside its bigger than i expected but still has that down home diner feel  my guess is that most of the people there were regulars  the wait staff was friendly to those they knew but also welcoming to me someone they had never seen before  i picked a table in the corner so i could observe what i imagine was a typical sunday morning  i ordered the breakfast special  scrambled eggs with bacon potatoes and toast  any place that has mancinis italian toast already gets thumbs up in my book  being in mckees rocks though they really dont have a choice  the potatoes were thin sliced with onions and very flavorful  the only way i can think of to describe the bacon isporkier  is that even a word  i just dont know how else to descibe it  the combination of foods was served in generous portions at a great price under   one random note i liked the tables and chairs  they were comfortable not just for sitting and enjoying a cup of coffee with my morning paper but also very comfortable for sitting and eating  good distance between the table and chairs  that may sound silly and i thought so too at first  but when i go to a place and the booth is too wide or too narrow it can hinder my enjoyment  not only will i return but i will also recommend marges place to anyone in the area  it was a surprisingly good find  i like places like neighborhood businesses like this where they make everyone feel like they belong|very quaint stopped here for lunch while traveling for work and i felt like i was in a diner in the s had a grilled cheese and fries  the food was good and everyone was friendly|great small town breakfast spot highly recommend georges mixed grill

say yes just posted on facebook that i wanted to go to breakfast and nobody wanted to go with me lets get to the review i am glad i said yes there homefries are awesome the eggs were just right i would definitely go here again|im new to pittsburgh so i wanted to try out all the local spots first and let me tell you this spot is definitely worth a try its a cute diner with a lot of local charm the prices are awesome and the food is even better i had the cinnamon raisin french toast with the home fries and a coffee all of it was really good im not a complainer but im picky and honestlyi have nothing but good things to say about this place i highly recommend you stop by and give it a try you can thank me later |always a favorite new name broadway brunch but the same great food good coffeequick service friendly waitstaff good home cooked foots at reasonable prices the neighborhood is a bit sketchy so lock your car doors   local foods  mancinis toast riccis sausage atmosphere is loud smokey and a bit greasy but the delicious food is worth it you cant beat marges place for a great deal  eggs cooked to order the best home fries i know of crisp hickory bacon roccos sausage hot buttered mancinis toast and vanilla french toasti hope it never changes by going upscale or healthy  organic vegan etc  parking meters are  cents an hour|ive been coming here for years but the new

breakfast though wow highly recommend this place|this was our first time visiting broadway brunch and we were not disappointed i found them on yelp and read the reviews and thought we should give it a go everything was delicious and im a very picky eater the coffee was wonderful and my eggs were just right i cant tell you the last time i ordered eggs over medium and actually got eggs over medium no burned crusty edges or anything and the bacon oh the bacon it was perfect this place is a gem and i cant wait to bring my mom and sister here next time they visit the owners rj and kelly were super nice and even came to check on us to make sure everything was good they are also in the process of remodeling to give it more of a s feel if youre looking for a great little homey feeling diner with great food and affordable prices this is the place|the true test of a great breakfast place is its ability to produce the perfect over medium egg the whites cooked through and the yokes unbroken warm and runny many places have either produced broken or rock hard yokes over hard or runny whites over easy in their attempts to create an over medium egg but broadway brunch completely nailed it im so glad i found this little breakfast treasure trove and look forward to visiting again on my next trip to pittsburgh|fantastic place new owners make this place warm and family friendlythe portion size is worth its weight in gold i would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone|best pizza in the western hemisphere|best pizza ever|i may be a little biased here based on the fact that ive been eating at this place since i was born  with that said ive eaten pizza all of the usa and this is still my absolute favorite place to order pizza from  when i come home to pittsburgh for a visit ordering from pasquarellis is a must   it is a true mom and pop pizza dive  the owners are really nice and man can they cook  the pizza is unique  handmade dough homemade sauce tasty cheese you name it  i love this placeif you order here please dont stop at pizza  ive never had a meatball that is better than mrs ps meatballs  they are so good that i dont compare other meatballs to them because it isnt fair to the other cooks  the steak hoagie is also one of my favorites  this place isnt cheap but this is real handmade food  if you want cheap pizza go to pizza hut|this pizza spot came highly recommended by several friends and we finally got a chance to taste the awesomeness stuffed crust with sauce that is not too sweet and not too bitter pepperoni and mushroom was a great combo cash only and sooooo worth it|this is the best pizza in mckees rocks mom and pop shop  its just a little shed located across from the dollar general  the pizza is amazing  the old lady answers the phone and takes care of the money  the old man makes the pizzas  you dont need extra toppings because they give you plenty of fresh ingredients a large pizza will feed a family of  even   the crust is dusty and crunchy  the sauce is one of a kind  its cash only so make sure you stop at the bank before you get there  oh and they dont deliver either  like i said its a mom and pop shop of two employees only    in fact im ordering a pie tonight  ps its great the next day in the oven|this place is amazing jim is a great artist traveled all the way from tampa just to get my tattoo i would recommend this place to everyone|wow i live in bellevue and this pizza shop was recommended to me you know the saying you cant judge a book by its cover well the same goes for this pizza shop not much to look at on the outside and not much to look at in the inside but man the pizza is wonderful nice flavorful sauce and the crust on the neapolitan pizza is thin and the surrounding crust is rolled over to hold  more sauce than surrounded with more cheese each pie is hand made and goes into a real pizza oven i also order a slice of their sicilian pizza i love real thick  pizza crust this baby was about  inches thick if you live in the area give these folks a tryi always try and support local small business oh remember to bring cash only|just moved to the area and decided to have a breakfast date at this small town diner i saw on google maps it was within walking distance so i figured it was worth a tryfood was absolutely great coffee was great and our server was extremely sweet and polite i believe this is going to be a once a week breakfast date spot for me and my girl|great service friendly staff great food great prices what more can you ask for in a small town breakfast place will definitely be back|got my first tattoo here in  and my second a couple weeks later all these years later they still look great havent faded much and haventhad em touched up the shop is professional and clean i highly recommend excellent quality work|the  ounce house sirloin is the bomb nuff said|this is another good giant eagle i pretty much like them all a wrong turn led us to this one a couple of weeks ago where we picked up some items huge store as usual|havent been here in a long time  never thought applebees would be so good the new sriracha shrimp are fantastic  bbqish spicy  fried perfectly the pub philly with extra grilled jalapeo was another hitif you get fries get the bbq dust on them or on the side best part was their in house made spicy cucumbers  pickles gone wildif you sit at the bar see nucc hes great|we decided on sapporo after reading soso reviews on ichiban and benihanas  this was a nice surprise yes it is not in the best looking area and yes the restaurant may not be as nice as a benihana  but the food was quite good  we had our doubts at first  we went in the middle of a sunday afterfoon and the place was empty  and service seemed to be a little disorganized and distracted  but once the chef came out and got to work it was great  the salad and soup were veyr good the soup being a little more beefy in flavor than what we were used to  we then had the fried rice and got a huge portion  we needed a little more soy sauce that what the chef used but he gladly provided more and the rice was delicious  then we moved to the main entrees  wife had the chateaubriand and i had the tenderloin and scallops  the meat although cooked  just a tad past medium still melted in your mouthand the scallops were absolutely the best ive ever had  again huge portions of meat and vegetables plus a large portion of noodles definitely a platefulwe did not get the requisite show you get at this kind of restaurant but weve seen it so many times its kinda boring to me  instead we had a nice conservsation with the chef about the pittsburgh area  all in all this was a very pleasant meal and ill definitely go back|i travel a lot and have eaten at a lot of hibachi restaurants i happen to have a project in the pittsburgh area and was looking for a hibachi place to take my coworkers i read several reviews on other hibachi places and they all sound the same the typical they are so busy the service sucks and they rush you in and out to turn tables quickly  i found sapporo and was very pleased it is in an odd location but once you step inside you feel the ambiance of cozy and family style my party felt the staff was very friendlyi had ordered the filet and shrimp with fried rice the others in my group ordered chicken broccoli and the sapporo deluxe which consists of lobster filet and shrimp we all got started with the soup and salads which was a pretty good size i didnt want to finish it all because i wanted to save room for dinner our chef was one of the most personable chefs i have encountered he was very talkative and really wanted to get to know us my file was delicious and the fried rice was excellent they make their fried rice from scratch its not prepared ahead of time like i see at most hibachi places i can definitely tell the difference my friend sam who ordered the chicken broccoli could not stop raving about the sauce that they used it is unlike soy sauce or teriyaki sauce we asked the chef about the sauce and sure enough it is one of a kind dan who ordered the sapporo deluxe was very pleased with his meal and couldnt even finish it actually we all needed togo boxes the portion amount here is incredible you definitely get your moneys worth herei would highly recommend this place to hibachi lovers because this place is surely a secret in pittsburgh i can not stress how different this place is compared to other hibachi places i think this restaurant is family owned and not a chain which i can always appreciate thank you sapporo for a great hibachi experience i will be back for sureanh|been to many hibachis this one is very clean the building is a little older but the family that runs it does a wonderful job i came here and got the chicken spot on i loved the beef stew it came with i always think the salad at hibachis are real alright but the sushi was delicious and the hibachi was wonderful with delicious noodles  veggies and rice best i have had in a while because it aint too salty many times for me its too extreme on the saltfree edamame with check in so that was a plus reasonably priced delicious japanese goodness seemed like it also had good drinkswill return|my boyfriend and i are practically hibachi connoisseurs so when we visited pittsburgh for the weekend the first thing we yelp searched was you guessed it hibachi sapporo was highly rated so we went for dinner on a saturday nightthe restaurant is located in front of a dimly lit motel but dont be discouraged by the facade because once you step inside the door the atmosphere is warm and inviting we were greeted by the owners daughter who sat us at an empty table while we waited for the other guests to join us the owners son brought us menus to look over and informed us that sapporo is a familyrun establishment the table quickly filled with regulars who said that sapporo was their favorite hibachi restaurant in pittsburgh one couple even said that they come for dinner every single saturday evening the owner himself came over to our table and began cooking our meali ordered the hibachi chicken and broccoli in sapporo special sauce and my boyfriend ordered the hibachi shrimp and chicken both with fried rice both meals were good but the special sauce on my chicken was absolutely delicious definitely one of the best hibachi chicken variation that i have tasted and my boyfriend really enjoyed how flavorful his shrimp tasted the chef a korean war veteran was engaging in our conversation and made you feel as if you were over a friends house for dinnerwe both agreed that we will definitely return to sapporo the next time that we are in pittsburgh|best italian sausage in the burgh  great to use for sandwiches spaghetti or grilling  they also have sandwiches sausage meatballs to eat in or take out  stuffed banana peppers are out of the world  sausage is not greasy with natural casings  you may have seen ernie ricci on cooking with chris fennimore on qed  many restaurants in pittsburgh use riccis sausage  some days you can watch them make the sausage thru a window|i would have taken a picture of my meal but i devoured it too quicklydj j   is correct    i heard about this place on pbs what do pittsburghers eat   they were giving their recipe for the sausage onions and peppers    we decided to trythey only have tables where you can stand and eat   they make everything on the premises   we ate in   i ordered the hot italian sausage sandwich and some side meatballs    the food was awesomei recommend you find this gem and get your italian fix on or order some of their meats  products and cook it yourself |sapporo is my favorite japanese restaurant period ive found other places that come close but for me this is the place i like to spend my money when it comes to hibachi cuisine sapporo is an unassuming place right next to steubenville pikes hottest tourist attraction the pittsburgh motel but dont let the location fool you step inside and enjoy a cozy atmosphere theres a bar at the front some tables to the right and the main dining area to the left theres also that karaoke machine ive never seen used in all the years ive gone hereunlike other japanese restaurants like saga great stuff and ichiban the cooks at sapporo arent all about giving an extensive show while cooking each of the chefs have a few of the basic crowd pleasers such as the knife and spatula toss and the onion volcano etc but really its all about the food which is fine by me i do sometimes miss when the chefs toss the pieces of shrimp up in the air towards your mouth to catch but only because no one ever likes to participate in that but me and its fun to look like a goofball while trying but thats neither here nor therethe food here is excellent theyve introduced a new look to their menu recently i dont know if they scaled it down as i often always order from the same section i did notice they have a couple of sushi options available they used to have a full sushi bar and you can still see that when you walk in but im not sure if theyre using it for anything other than just whats on the main menu which would be a shame if so as their sushi was always great and you could order it from a separate menu again this may be something they still have that im not aware ofat any rate the starter soup and salad is great i love the bits of onion in the soup its a very strong broth but not overpowering the ginger dressing on the salad is something you either like or loathe at any japanese restaurant and here i really love it but i tend to like it everywhere ive had it so im not a real stickler when it comes to thatusually i order the filet mignon and shrimp with fried rice for my main meal though last time i got the deluxe version of the dish which also includes lobster tail and ice cream for dessert either way its a great dish ive also had the chicken and shrimp and have enjoyed it as wellnow my favorite thing here is the shrimp sauce i call it the magic sauce its of the light pink variety and thin consistency im always disappointed when i go to other japanese steakhouses and they either dont have shrimp sauce altogether or they have the thicker mayonnaisebased version which is ok but doesnt come close to the awesomeness that is the magic sauce apparently its a secret as to just what goes into it on one visit our chef joked that its main base was strawberry quik which one of the fellow diners at my table believedso if you get the fried rice here dump some of the magic sauce on there its amazing use it for your steak or chicken as well i find myself doing that and then saving the darker sauce for my grilled veggies which are also top notch here terrific grilled onions and ripe zucchini as well as mushrooms and broccoli i dont care for broccoli personally but the rest is excellentsapporo has also started throwing in noodles to the mix according to the owner this is because other restaurants started doing it so patrons who came in started asking why sapporo didnt have them as well i think they were doing fine without them as it just adds even more to an already large amount of food but they are good if unnecessarythe steak here is great ive had the sirloin as well as the filet i always get mine cooked rare and it is of the melt in your mouth caliber the shrimp never taste fishy and the lobster tail is similarly excellent all around you get a great meal here for the priceim not sure which nights are more crowded than not anymore sapporos a funny place in that some weeknights youll drive by and its packed and then other nights it will be quiet id suppose weekends draw the biggest crowds yet even when it was packed ive never had to wait long to be seated at a tableso if you havent been give sapporo a try its been there forever the owner and staff are super nice and they really do care about serving you great food when you visit they dont do lunches anymore so its strictly dinner meals so be looking at spending at least  dollars on up for adults and around  or so for kids meals its not some place you would go frequently if youre on a budget but that makes it all the more a treat when you do go|i was looking for a florist to deliver flowers for me as i live in texas and cindy essers had the best floral website i have ever seen  it was so easy to work with and order  i also just recently went into their store and the staff was fantastic  these guys know their stuff and do great work|i have been a fan of ricci italian sausage for as long as i can remember  my italian aunts  love riccis too the new location is now in kennedy township located conveniently in the kenmar plaza  next to subway   the robinson location is now closed  i am thrilled about the move its closer to my home   hot sausage sweet sausage meatballs etc   there are frozen food items available too  pasta sauce meatballs etc there is also a shelf in the store stocked with sausage buns sauce and other items  i often stop after work to grab dinner because they are open until     specials  pazzo monday any sandwich or   sausage roll with a soft drink is   tuesdaythursday mac and cheese with ground hot sausage  per serving   friday sherrys pasta efagoli  per serving wednesdaysaturday my favorite special  homemade lasagna  made with homemade sauce tallutos lasagna pasta grande and lamagna cheese and ricci ground hot sausage  per serving  i must tell you that the lasagna is my favorite menu item at ricci and anytime i get it  when i eat it i get into a zone and i dont ever share yes its that goodi love to make my own spaghetti sauce using ricci italian sausage  i have tried using other types of sausages  like giant eagle brand but you can always tell when its riccis sausage because its a good batch of sauce and everyone raves about it    mangia mangia|cyril did my sisters wedding and now is working on things for my brothers wedding  he is wonderful to work with  helpful in every way  my sisters flowers were stunning|ordered delivery when staying at the sheraton station square   it wasnt super fast but wasnt unreasonable mins and the pizza was so good that i ended up eating way more than i intended  not too greesey with a nice balance of cheese sauce dough and toppings|they dont deliver to me anymore moved to lawrenceville  however their pizza is good not too greasy not too dry  nice balance with the sauce cheese and toppings  they have awesome house rolls im partial to the spinache and feta house rolls  they are so delicious  pretty cheap  the delivery time is kind of long but they are open late and i love that|the pizza here is great i always pick up a pizza when i am near bellevue  i have only ever eaten their pizza|rbs is very consistent with their foodquality pizza and hoagies buffalo chicken pizza and hoagie are both really goodi recommend|this was the first place we tried after moving to bellevue and over a year later we still order almost weekly  their staff is really friendly delivery always quick or  at least doesnt ever take longer than the estimated time given and food is delicious  five stars for the staff and the food but four stars because i wish they had better specials|i stopped by here two nights ago as part of a night where i would try three different pizzas in the bellevueavalon area  i called my order in for an xl pizza ahead of time and was told that i would have a  minute wait until it was ready  since i only had a general idea of where it was located i ended up parking near it trying to locate it and then driving past it before finally locating it in a small strip mall right next to lincoln ave  there isnt too much to say about the inside of this pizza place except that they have a counter up front with a little bit of room to wait and no customer seating not that this is a bad thingpizzas in general can be broken down into three separate components cheese crust and sauce  this pizza actually had the least amount of cheese on it of all of the pizzas that we tried but ended up being my favorite which would be surprsing if you know me  the cheese was not that strong in flavor but the amount of it let it pair perfectly with the sauce which had a nice spice profile strong on the garlic and maybe some oregano coming through it  the crust on this pizza was the thinnest of the bunch that we tried and was cooked nicely which also had a little crisp which i loved  the bottom line for me is that i would head back to r  bs again in the future for pizza  it was easily the most expensive of the bunch that i bought last night at  after tax for an xl but as the old adage goes you get what you pay for and if you like garlic then you should like this pizza|my fiance and i have made rbs our friday night dinner tradition for over a year the food is consistently amazing and portions are huge whether you choose to pick up or have it delivered its always less then  minutes  and can we take a second to acknowledge the staff always exceedingly friendly and happy to accommodate any special requests sadly were moving out of the area in two weeks so we wont be able to continue our tradition but if you havent given them a try do it might i suggest the buffalo chicken sub and the cheese and bacon fries epic|great pizza wings and salads havent tried much else we love their rbs special pizza they have specials on combos two pizzas pizza and wings etc theyre pretty quick and have always gotten our order correct|get the white pizza with bacon youre life will never be the same never had a bad experience ordering from rbs|these guys make excellent hoagies we especially like the supreme italian and the turkey try their pizza excellent dont add too many toppings you will disguise the great taste of the sauce and the dough i suggest either plain or pepperoni|my boyfriend and i ordered the rbs special pie no bacon last night and the greek salad added artichokes  so good  the pizza was one of the best i have had in a long time and i eat a lot of pizza the salad was huge and fed us both easily  it certainly wasnt as cheap as dominos but the quality was great and so delicious  i would give rbs at least  when it comes to price but if you are willing to pay the extra money for good quality then i highly recommend this pizza joint|they took me right in and i didnt have to wait they were extremely fast and courteous some people complain about they trying to upsell services and normally i hate when places do that but i never felt pushed there were two things that he recommended i do within in the next six months and i already knew about them ive seriously waited longer in some fast food drive thrus|great service in and out in a timely manor  no pressure at all to purchase any additional unwanted services  will be back|lots of memories from this place for me  their pizza may not be the best in the world but boy does it take me back to the ss and growing up in pittsburghi am slightly disappointed that they moved to a new location in bellevue  their old one while a bit dirty and run down had quite the charm to it  the new place looks too clean cut and it seems like theyre trying to be something theyre not which is just a good old fashioned pizza joint|excellent pizza  although the mushrooms were from a can but the crust  sauce and rest of toppings on the sicilian pizza were delicious nice family friendly|service was very goodcalzone was excellent|a great little place delicious and affordable italian food great salads and pasta try the pizza rolls|best allmeat pizza in the area  always done delivery never eaten in the restaurant so i cant speak to the dining experience|best pizza in the north boros  i cant make a trip to the area without stopping at luigis  when i was a kid the man himself actually owned the place and made the pizza but theyve since moved to a new location under new ownershipbut the pizza is still just as good  i prefer the thincrust but the sicilian is also excellent  the fried zucchini is a favorite and the mozzarella sticks are great too  the calzones are tasty but may cause a coronary if you expect more than a handful of spinach among cheese in the spinach calzone youll be disappointed  because its pittsburgh the chicken salad comes with french fries  i tend to opt for takeout but there is also a midsized dining section|i have been eating at luigis since before birth my mom loves this stuff the new location is nice but i miss the coziness of the old place the food has been consistent through the transition which happened a long while ago by the way also i have read a few other reviews that said luigis has left but i talk with him every time i am in regardless this is a great family owned pizzeria and i recommend the calzone because it is generously stuffed with ricotta |luigis pizza is amazing the sicilian pizza takes me back to how my grandma used to make homemade pizza i cant wait to go back  definitely worth the minute trip there |luigis is the best of the best awesome authentic pepperoni i have eaten here for years this place is a tradition in my family and its still as good as they were  years ago they recently remodeled and have a great menu selection by far the best pizza in bellevue and right up there with fioris as the best in pittsburgh|just ordered delivery from here the soup was very good i also would recommend the specialty salad i also was surprised at how quickly the order was delivered it was delivered within a  an hour|this place has great tasting food i had a italian hoagie and it was great the pizza is top notch|i was one of their first customers starting at the old location i live further away now but will stop anytime i am near as they quite simply have the best pizza period of anywhere ive been i have referred many friends and family and they all say the same the owners and staff are very friendly and caring people and treat you like family the other food is good too especially the wedding soup although  of the time we get the great pizza the dough sauce and cheese are second to none|luigis is everything i expected it to be  a decent place to order an authentic looking and  tasting pizza  i usually prefer new york style and luigis offers it by the slice  i also ordered lasagna off of their daily lunch menu   i think there are at least  regularly featured menu items to choose from and a drink is included  luigis has a large dining area or customers can walk up to the take out counter if they choose|my wife and i love this place decently affordable our server is always great and very friendly the food is delicious and its a nice homey atmosphere the first time we went here we told the server we were newlyweds and luigi made us tiramisu and gave it to us for free highly recommend|this is the mcdonalds to end all mcdonalds in my book heres why the drivethru is crazy fast there are  drivethru lanes to keep it crazy fast even when they have to make my dogs special noonion cheeseburger they are crazy fast for years they gave my familys dog jamie free baby ice cream cones jamie didnt need many moments of excitement to be happy but go for ride was one of them and ice cream time was another the drivethru staff is so sweet to my little pup lucy when i take her to cheeseburger windowso i guess what im saying is this is the best mcdonalds for dogs and their parents and as someone who generally only visits mcdonalds to reward my dog for good behavior after a vet visit this mcdonalds is just right|i am shocked to see this place isnt five stars we order delivery from here at least once a week their lunch specials are great and the portions are always always plentiful ive never waited more than  minutes even though they always say  i think its respectful just in case they run behind i will say that if you are looking for a truly authentic chinese meal this probably isnt your best option although way more authentic than house of lee yuck both my boyfriend and i think it is plenty authentic for us always delicious i have cravings for their eggrolls daily he loves their wonton soup it is the only kind of soup i will eat its that good and we love the cute little chinese guy that usually delivers our food my bf and i always get the biggest smiles on our faces when we hear our apt buzz with  china seeaaa |whether you live in ben avon heights brighton heights  or anywhere in between  i urge you to try china sea  it is quite simply the best local chinese delivery  the people on the phone are helpful and friendly  the delivery is always quoted at  minutes yet the food always arrives earlier and is always unbelievably hot and fresh  some favorites of ours are the kung pao shrimp pork lo mein and hot and sour soup  i dont mean to compare china sea to the higher end chinese restaurants in our area  it is not sesame inn or china palace it is not a date night out sort of place it most definitely is a cozy inexpensive good quality stay in and relax go to  hope this helps  enjoypsa few final thoughts while we were going back for seconds they only use all white meat chicken in their dishesppsalways look at their online coupons you will get something free|for your runofthemill chinese place china sea does pretty well for itself the food is good and the people are very nice the prices are reasonable and i like that if you order over a certain amount you can get something free with a coupon listed on their site they always say  min for delivery but ive never had to wait more than  min|love their sesame chicken i eat it all the time and its just enough to be stuffed and have leftovers for tomorrows lunch they are fast making the food as well and if you call in they will have it ready by the time you get there|i love china seas we order a lot love their sweet and sour chicen and their general tso chicken they will mke it to your wants i cant eat spicy food but my son loves it so they will adjust it to your liking eggroll  are good woman that anwered the phone was very nice my food always arrives hot  love you china seas|came back to pittsburgh for a wedding and couldnt find anything in my price range close to the city until i found this motelit was very affordableroom was okaycable tv and ac worked fine|fair prices but good quality and amazing designs that are custom made plus gel and solar nails are available for those interested offers waxing services completely renovated and the spa pedicure chair is amazing|small vet clinic just off of rt  in avalon offers friendly service and extremely reasonable prices  with the frequent visits for vaccinations that a puppy has to have its hard to find a place that wont break the bank while providing proper care for your dog  dr bigger has been great and i would certainly recommend avalon vet to any local pet lover|excellent  dr fitzgerald and dr bigger are superior in their knowledge and manner reasonable prices very friendly caring staff i wouldnt go anywhere else|for over  years the avalon veterinary hospital staff has treated my pets cats rabbits fish and a turtle  the prices are very reasonable and ive never been charged for followupsdr fitzgerald provided an affordable diabetes treatment plan for my cat to prolong his life the prognosis went from a few months to three healthy years  when my cat suddenly had kidney failure from diabetic shock i was only charged for the treatmentnot the emergency appointment fees the staff was extremely considerate when my cat passedsome who knew him were even cryingmy other cat gained a reputation as a menace  but the staff never complainednot even when she required four people to hold her down just to get her shotswhen i was sold a diseased turtle a a child dr moore was very kind and did not charge for the visit nor the medication  he recognized my interest in science and patiently answered all of my yearold questions  he even showed me how he made slides and how his microscope worked i later studied biology and worked as a lab tech so thanks  dr moore also took exemplary care of our rabbits who all lived unusually long liveson a practical note they require all animals to be in a cage or on a leash  i once had a wellbehaved cat who was too sick to chase the dogs wrapped in a blanket since his collar would have been over an open woundbut they generally enforce the cageleash policy for the safety of all animals  there is a small parking lot next to the clinic or you can usually park pretty easily on the crossstreet|if i could give dr bigger  stars i would he makes that hospital if this review was on dr moore i would give it a minus he is terribly rude i am moving back to sewickley and will plan to use dr bigger for sure he is the best vet i have ever experiencedso detailed so caringi just love him and so do my animals|my puppy was admitted here  days ago in very poor shape i was scared he wasnt going to make it and being it was my  yr olds new dog made things a bit harder on us they called  days a day with updates and did everything they could to help renegade and to also make me feel better  days later my puppy came home and is still in recovery but doing alot betteri cant thank there entire staff enough for saving my dog will continue to take my dogs there and recommend them to everyone i know special thanks to dr v and lenny |the only vet i will use from now on the staff is amazing from the receptionist to the vet it really does take a team to provide great service i was bringing my cat in as a new patient with concerns about his back leg they fit me in the next day i called them at  pm on monday and they had me in tuesday at  this alone was amazing on account that the vet i use to take him to never returned my calls the vet kouch i maybe spelling that wrong was so patient with my not so happy cat she diagnosed the issue it was his poor back they filled a prescription updated his shots and didnt run any test that werent necessary i want to trust the vet to provide the care that my animal needs not run me through the ringer i will do anything for my cat for them to be honest about what is necessary and whats not put my mind at ease that he was getting the treatment he needed and no unnecessary test that would only stress him out  great job hopefully we will be back for just shots but if anything else does come up you will be seeing me and tyty again|ive had great experiences at the avalon veterinary hospital  weve taken our dog there for routine things shots ear care and also for a mystery sickness which the vet was very involved with diagnosing and treating she actually called to check up on him personally  the staff remembered him and loved seeing him visit  ive recently taken my cat here who has a growth on his arm  he has to have it removed which dr bigger explained can be done there and quoted me an extremely reasonable price  i am so pleased with the services my pets have gotten at the avalon vet i wouldnt think of going elsewhere  the staff and the vets are all extremely friendly and knowledgable  the only thing keeping it from  stars is that it location is pretty small and the exam rooms are only divided by curtains no doors  sometimes my cat gets pretty stressed if a dog is in the room next to him|this is my favorite event restaurant by which i mean spendy but definitely worth it for special occasions  it is great for intimate birthdays celebrations etc  whatever karmic intervention gave the bustling borough of bellevue this restaurant makes me think we as a community has done something right but more importantly the food  oh the food  the ownerchef takes so much care it makes the whole experience very enjoyable  i have never had a bad meal  i|my boyfriend and i went here last night the restaurant is dark romantic and the decor is amazing there are photographs of the owners and chefs family on the walls its cute my boyfriend called ahead and told them i was vegetarian and the chef prepared a couple of things for me  there is no set menu and the waitress reads out what the chef has prepared for the night there are  courses an appetizer pasta main course a salad and and dessert i thought the salad after the entree was pretty interesting  they are also very generous with the bread which i lovedevery meal was made to perfection it had a homey feeling my boyfriend had some scallops that he is still talking about  my entree was spaghetti squash with mushroom wild rice and berries and limed artichokes there were soo many flavors and all the ingredients were balanced the service was great all in all it was an amazing experience the chef came out to say hi at the end of the night i finished off my dinner with the creme brulee and some coffee our bill came to  with tip and it was absolutely worth it this is a great restaurant for a super special occasions and  it is very privatenot to dressy and not too casual pick out a great bottle of wine or two and get ready to get your taste buds blown im pretty sure my boyfriend and i will be going back|yesgreat servicegreat foodlove the byob |i recently received an orchid as a gift from here and its lovely and bloomed quickly  they do bouquets corsages spectacular arrangements and also sell knickknacktype gifts if you need a lastminute present for grandma  the staff is welcoming without hovering too much  the prices are comparable to the grocery store florists but dietz offers more flair and fresherlooking flowers|i went to vivo on a whim while searching for a good byob to celebrate a special occasion with my other half  i was skeptical as i had never been to bellvue before and knew there was not much there  i was pleasantly surprised with vivos atmosphere  in the heart of this small neighborhood i found a fabulous european like restaurant that tickled my taste pallette  the menu is entirely verbal and progressive meaning your entree order is not taken until you are finished with your appetizer  something i had come to know and love when studying abroad in italy  after a lengthy meal of beyond exceptional food the chefowner visited our table and everyone elses to ensure satisfaction and talk to us about our lives and the life of vivo  he was sincere personable and a real treat to the already amazing food  this place is worth every penny viva la vivo|my sister lives in bellevue and i have used fred dietz floral twice now to send her flowers i live out of state  the woman who answers the phone is amazing she is kind helpful and professional  being remote can make this process difficult but she is very descriptive and willing to make your desires work in your price range  my sister says the arrangements have been lovely and lasting  i highly recommend patronizing this business|dont let their name fool you  this establishment specializes in other goods and gifts other than flowers  they have a very nice collection of jewelry clothing handbags seasonal decorations and much more there is even an antique store on the lower level of their shop  the staff is very friendly and helpful  they have regular open house events for the holiday season  very comfortable environment|suzanne and kristi are both excellent beautiful job on cuts and color my whole family goes to them now even the guys they are always pleased with results and i get lots of compliments|let me just tell you i have really really difficult hair  type b naturally curly  grey i dye it dark and mess with the color myself  never good  if you want to know where to get a good haircut you ask someone with my hair since i have been going to mane attractions i have really loved my hair i have been going there for about  years kristi was even able to cut my curly hair into a short reverse bob without making me look like i was wearing a helmet  you curly girls know what i am talking about i have had nothing but complements on my hair and even my mom who is always honest is impressed the only complaint i ever have is that yes sometimes i have gone there on the spur of the moment and it has been closed during the week i just know to call and schedule things it is a small business and i get it  ps kids haircuts are only  and my daughter loves it|the lincoln bakery did my wedding cake  white cake chocolate mousse filling and buttercream icing it was fabulous we got so many compliments not only did it look beautiful but it tasted great|krispy creme grocery store cakes  git ahta tahn when it comes to donuts pastries and cakes they dont hold a wisk to lincoln bakery in bellevue or most western pa bakeries for that matter  their cakes hit the top of my list with edys downtown coming in second  the batter is light and moist while the icing is smooth  not too sweet  not too lardy  by all means feel free to give them a decorating challenge as their peeps got mad skillzin my experience pittsburgh natives dont seem to realize how good their sweet tooths have it here till they move away  so when i travel westward for the holidays i bring some lincoln bakery sweets alongi highly recommend their burnt almond torte with either custard or lemon filling for nearly any occasion  i get these for corporate gatherings often and they always go over well  and you know what they say about trying to please everyoneid suggest giving them a few days to a weeks notice as they keep pretty busyas a side note though i rave about their donuts pastries and cakes for cookies id recommend mois italian bakery in monroeville|quite possibly the best bakery in pittsburgh  its got everything from the lowend cookies cupcakes donuts to the high wedding cakes tortes tarts  make any special or large orders weeks in advance  the tastiest wedding cake i ever sampled was from here smooth buttercream icing with alternating raspberry and lemon filling in white batter|in one word unbelievable their cakes are incredibly delicious despite the  minute trip from my house i purchase all my cakes from here the cakes are incredibly moist and the butter cream icing is just the right amount of sweet my favorite cake is a yellow cake with fudge icing not chocolate but fudge ive also had the raspberry filling and would recommend that as well they are incredibly creative with their decorating of the cakes including wedding cakes but if you want something specialized nonstandard icing etc be sure to call ahead and place your order in advance warning saturday mornings you will surely encounter a very very long line whether picking up your order or just swinging by for some goodies even better than their cakes are their petitfours chocolate with chocolate icing or white with vanilla icing ive ordered them for bridal showers or just stopped by to pick one up for myself they are the perfect size for one person if you arent on a diet they do sell out of these so place an order ahead of time if you want a large order or stop by early in the morning to make sure you can get them ive gotten cookies from here and they were average i think this is the best bakery in the burgh for cakes but not necessarily all other pastries and breads the only reason i didnt rate the bakery  stars is their customer service which is borderline horrific they are never friendly and whether you are calling to place an order or standing at the counter they just want to get the order taken and move on to the next person in line the cakes are good enough that i put up with the service but be forewarned|i love lincoln bakery so much  we just got a birthday cake from here today and everyone at the party loved it  i seriously cannot believe how gorgeous it was  for fall cakes and cupcakes i cant even imagine anyone making anything prettier  the icing is wonderful although the colored icing is sort of bitter but i think that is the case anywhere  the white icing is just perfect and not too sweet  when i told my neighbor that i was coming here tonight to pick up the cake she immediately asked me if i had ever had the carrot cake  yes i have and it is amazing  the burnt almond torte rivals prantls  i think the girls who work there are so nice and helpful  and i love all of the homemade candy that they sell  it is just the sweetest local gem  love lincoln bakery|lincoln bakery is great  my family has been ordering cakes from here for years and i always request one for my birthday each year  we probably order about  cakes a year from lincoln bakery and often its the same one  the simple and delicious chocolate cake with chocolate icing  if you like chocolate cakes try it and i bet youll like it|my daughter cant pass by here without asking to get something  all i can say is you had better bring your sweet tooth|lincoln bakery makes very delicious donuts pastries and desserts their bread selection however was very limited and upon making our choice the quality of the bread was mediocre we were also disappointed that many of the things in the shop are not labeled and when the store is busy it can be difficult to find staff to explain what different options are still this should be a go to for a local bakery if you are looking for something sweet|i ordered a cake for a baptism i did a search on the best tasting cake around pittsburgh and after reading reviews lincoln bakery was the one we had to tryi called them a week ahead they told me the design they would do and after seeing some pictures on their facebook page i trusted it will work out so i went ahead and ordered it it was a big hit some of my family members were getting seconds the cake wasnt too sweet and the icing not too buttery i will have to say that next time i need a cake i will order from this bakery and maybe try some of the other things they carry in their store|lovelovelove lincoln bakery my absolute favorite is the chocolate pudding cake it comes with mounds of chocolate shavings on top they also gave fantastic carrot cake and cheese cakes always something delicious in the pastry counter the seasonal cakes are always so creative and fun to look at in the windowthe staff there is pretty great as well especially dottie shes been there for years and is always so kind|id give this a true  but am rounding up in good faith i walked in to get an iced cake for a going away party i knew i might have to sacrifice quality because i didnt place a callahead orderthe cake was deliciousicing was creamy and not too sweet i was happy there were about  different premade cakes i could choose from vanilla chocolate and marble in pink blue and green styles workers were friendly and helpful lady said the burnt almond torte was a customer favorite so ill be back to trywhat i was disappointed with was the icing job felt like i could have done a better job with spacing and lettering than the worker who helped me she may have been inexperienced but i expect someone working at a bakery to at least be able to write the basics feel like it ruined an otherwise lovely cake there was a wide selection of cookies cakes large and individual sizes and freshbaked donuts ill be back to try more from this local bakery just be wary about getting cakes iced on the spot|my new favorite stop  if you like carrot cake this is certainly the place to try  and  you will not be disappointed  truthfully i did not know what to expect during my first visit but everything i have purchased since then  has been fresh and satisfying|had to make a trip to leetsdale to visit a client and found myself in an area where i struggled to find a place for goodies  a quick yelp search revealed lincoln bakerythis place is awesome and it is now saved in my gps for future stops  highly recommend|lincoln bakery is a top notch bakery in the pittsburgh area which i feel is on par with other high ranking bakeries in the area such as prantls and oakmont bakery  i love that they have slices of many of their cakes and cheesecakes available for individual purchase  i purchased an assortment of these to take to a dinner party and they were all gobbled up and it was a great way to allow everyone to try small bites of a variety of treats  my personal favorite was the chocolate mousse cake because i love chocolate and it was sweet without being overly sweet creamy with the right balance of sweet and bitter from the chocolate  i also sampled the tiramisu which was delicate with just a hint of espresso and the cream was perfect  the best thing was that while the desserts were all obviously sweet they werent so sweet that it was sickening as ive experienced with more commercial cakes from grocery or big box stores  the other cakes that i bought and all of which the dinner attendees loved were the lemon cake the oreo cheesecake one called the sweet spot that had chocolate and peanut butter and finally a white cake with chocolate frosting  it is close to my neighborhood so i will definitely return the next time that i need baked goods for a special occasion  they are closed on sunday but the great thing is that they have extended hours the rest of the week until  pm mf and until  pm on saturdays|ive never had anything bad from here their buttercream icing is more buttery than it is sugary its amazing plus they have the coolest holiday cakes|i recently purchased my th vehicle from bob and linda at metro motors  a unique  bmw xit touring wagon i keep returning for the great deals and quality selection of highline vehicles if you are a car

times i had to go very badly on a large shopping trip and had to leave and run up the street to a restaurant and come back and finish my shopping|kuhns is the perfect grocery store for bellevue staff are friendly and helpful and the store is small enough to navigate in a few minutes which makes it great for picking up weekly groceries always happy with the produce and fresh fruit selectionsi even bought kale there last week deli is busy after work and for good reason fair prices and a big selection of meats cheeses and side dishes grocery store is open til midnight throughout the week closes earlier on sundays so you can run in for those last minute thingstheres also a redbox out front so when your friend has a breakup swing by for ice cream and a chick flick compliments of kuhns|wow an

kuhns is great for the oh crap  i need kind of tripand quite frankly as nice as they are and decently priced as they are this small business deserves our business more than the cut throat monster bird|i enjoy my trips to kuhns market for a variety of reasons  first of all it is super convenient  secondly its a journey into my past when most  grocery stores were set up like this and i would see neighbors encountering  other neighbors who gladly took the time to find out how each others families were doing  this  hometown feel is priceless thirdly i usually find exactly what i need for just about the same amount of money i spend elsewhere  this community is well served with the presence and dedication of kuhns market and its employees|without question this is my favorite thrift store in

youre never surprised when you leave at the state of the items youve just bought it is surprisingly clean  nothing seems to smell so i can only imagine theyve laundered everything thoroughly  there

markdowns and fresh merchandise  these people know how to turn over their stock  because the place is never empty and there are specials every day the stock flips rapidly  the merchandise is never the same week to week so as i mentioned before its addictive  you never know what youll finda summary of a few things ive bought here a  dollar designer knit dress a few silk twinsets  countless heels two pairs of birkenstocks and two pairs of doc martens  a dressmakers bust  a pressure cooker you get the picture  the prices arent rock bottom but close enough and the quality of the clothing will help

is a great place to discover unique things they also have daily deals such as  off of certain color tags have to dig through other things though to find something interesting which is part of the adventure|simply the best thrift store ive ever been to well worth the   hour drive from my hometownfirst and foremost everything is  off all of the timesecondly bring cash they do not accept credit cardsthe store is full of wonderful pieces of clothing all arranged by color and type not by size which is unfortunate i found a wide selection of everything from casual pieces to highend business attire to supertrendy teen clothing what surprised me most about this store was the quality of the clothing almost all of the pieces were flawless a few were worn or faded in some way and the price reflected that brand names were bountiful banana republic ralph lauren chicos jones new york ann taylor american eagle hm there were also some wonderful vintage pieces from the s bright colors and

taylor loft and banana republic for a total of come to this thrift store itll make all other shopping obsolete|first time i really took a moment to look for some stuff its always a hit or miss all the other thrift store ive visited later in my trip showed me that thrift store sure does drain a lot of your mental energy looking for stuff there was a hellacious project but i bought a steeler jersey for  some polos and a cute outfit for a friends baby  before reduction and after  wohh that felt good|i love a deal and this has been my favorite thrift store since i was a kid  first there is some sort of halfoff deal every daysecond the used book selection is pretty decent  yeah there are a ton of selfhelp and patterson mass markets that you have wade through but tc boyle for two bucks  yes pleasethird the home goods  ive gotten huge solid wood picture frames for only a couple dollars  the art prints inside were hideousbut i threw those away restained the frames to my liking cut new mats

porch  httpwwwpickuppleaseorg  super easy|i love love love this store i thought the one on saw mill run was great but this was i think is way awesomer if only awesomer were a word i love to go here and find lots of home decor items to decorate my house candle holders dining sets paints sculptures and sooo much more i found this small desk lamp that has a victorian look to it with the shade included for  the lamp shade was made of some kind of smooth material almost like leather its such a great find there are plenty of items for sale at this place and most of them are in great shape so the clothes which occupy most of the store are the best find the store has certain days that offer you  certain color tags i went on a monday and it was half off yellow and white tags other days its half off blue or green or red i love to go on saturdays this past week it was half off every tag except white i found so many items for such a cheap price  shirts for  and tunics for  have you ever find items for  i have i love when i find a great shirt or sweater for  or less or when you find a brand new item with the tags on them for under  i bought a brand new pair of arizona jeans in my size for  i couldnt believe it i was too excitedthe clothes are organized by color but not by size which is a good and bad thing i like to shop by color since i dont wear too many yellows or purples i can avoid those sections all together but when i do find a nice shirt in the color i want the size becomes an issue there were a lot of nice shirt that were just too small or too big even when i have to pass on a nice shirt i tend to find one thats just as good at the same price shopping here is a gold find my sister was the one who introduced me to this store and i used to make fun of her for shopping thrift if i had known that it was nothing like the good will i would have been here a lot sooner now my sister makes fun f me for going so often what an amazing place this is ill probably never shop retail againreminder cash onlybut they have an atm  fee|rating this store is tough because i want to give it a i really dohuge selection of clothing housewares electronics and furniture but no fitting roomsyes you read that correctly no fitting rooms are you kidding me it doesnt completely overshadow the fact that they have great items but when  of what you offer is clothing youve got to have a few rooms for people to try stuff onthe clothing is organized by style and color not by size so be ready to dig same thing with the shoesi asked a staff member where to try on clothing and she directed me to the back corner of the store where there were two long mirrors hanging side by side on the wall directly in front of the kitchen section i was slightly confused for a minute and then realized that was my only option i decided against even peeking at any pants or blouses and instead went for jackets and sweaters i could easily try on over my shirt now the mirrors are directly sidebyside so if there are two people trying things on over their clothes so weird youre going to be right up on top of them not to mention youll be right on top of people browsing through the kitchen sectiona lady i was chatting with told me that she has seen women come in wearing tight fitting shirtstank tops and spandex tights hey those are somehow socially acceptable as pants in public now anyway so they are able to easily try everything on over their clothing still weirdas annoyed as i was about the fitting room situation i will probably make a trip out there again in the future to browse based solely on the size of the store i just might have to wear some spandex|i cant believe ive been here multiple times and havent reviewed it yet  i absolutely love this place  its a super thrift store if you willno matter when i come here i always find something  it quite the experience  i always make sure its a day when i am off of work because i can literally spend hours here just looking  its a good thing that i do this you cant just show up here and think that you will be able to gran an item and then leave  like a fellow reviewer said there are not fitting rooms here so be prepared to walk into someone trying on a potential great new garment for them self in the middle of an aisle  sometimes you just cant avoid this i blame the fact that they have mirrors set up throughout storesthey have everything you can seem to desire here  clothing to electronics furniture to bedding books to movies  everything is under this roofcash only atm on premise|this thrift store is one of the best in pittsburgh its huge and has a great selection of books clothes and housewareswith that being said there are a number of drawbacks to shopping here because of its popularity it starts with the parking there are a few spots in front of the store with two overflow lots that quickly fill up getting out is a bear if youre heading back towards the city like i usually am because to pull up to the traffic light you have to go the wrong way through the very narrow parking area in front of the store crossing three lanes on  without the help of a traffic light just seems like a bad planonce inside the store beware of other customers on the weekends ive encountered aggressive shoppers on multiple occasions who are usually welding carts as weapons lets just say some shoppers think its ok to block off entire aisles so they can peruse a sectionother notes there are no fitting rooms i sometimes try on clothes over the ones im wearing in front of a mirror because hey its a thrift storealso theyre cash onlydespite these setbacks i find myself coming back every few months because ive found some really awesome things here from dresses to plates just think of the trip as a little adventure|this is one of the true sleepers of neighborhood pittsburgh since  this dinerfamily restaurant has been serving excellent breakfasts and homecooked dinners the staff has been there as longthey have some of the best freshbrewed iced tea in the city they also have my favorite pancakes if youre looking for a cheap low key dependable place to go come home at  oclock one evening sit in the window and especially around the holiday season i assure you that it will be one of the best old time meals youll ever have i hate its name but i love the rusty nail|ive been going here since i was a wee tot  i have always enjoyed their food even though theres nothing too special about it  i really like their breakfast menu  you always seem to get lots of food for very little money which is nice  my only complaint is that it is way too small and always very busy  they should really look at expanding the restaurant|i ate here this past sunday morning for breakfast with my girlfriend  i have been by this place many times and was excited to finally make it inside  we were lucky that we went fairly early as a line developed shortly after we were seated at our table  the rusty nail is prepared for this in a pretty cool way though as they have a list outside of the restaurant that you can sign into as well as some coffee to partake of while you waitfor my entree i decided to go with one of the specials for the day which was the rusty nail omelet while my girlfriend decided on another special which was the a mushroom spinach and feta junior omelet  her omelet is self explanatory while mine had in it some salami cheese and three pieces of sliced pepperoni on top of it  it was readily apparent that the pepperoni was not the cheap kind that you get on most pizzas as it had more flavoring and tasted much better  both omelets came with sides of home fries and toast for which we both ordered deli rye  the junior omelet tasted good as the sourness of the feta played nicely with earthy mushrooms while the spinach made it feel like i was eating healthy  my omelet was just as good if not better than the junior omelet as the cheese and meats combined to make it seem like i was almost eating a pizza  some of my hash browns were slightly overcooked and they had too many onions for my taste but we still decent enough to be a side to the main showthe bottom line for me is that i would definitely head back here in the future  everything that i tasted was good and i would not hesitate to take any of my friends here for a breakfast|i had one of the breakfast specials and it was fantastic there was also a continuous flow of coffee which is always nice probably just missed the church crowd so it wasnt too busy either definitely a good breakfast spot|my wife my daughter and i went here for breakfast i got the breakfast special  for french toast and eggs clean great service delicious food you cant beat it for breakfast|the first time we went here assuming by the name that it must be a dive bar we were disappointed but we were also hungry so we ordered dinner it was just nothing special pretty typical greasy diner food while there we couldnt help but notice all the articles and awards on the wall stating this was one of pittsburghs best breakfast spots so sometime later on a hungover morning after a wedding some of my boyfriends friends were staying with me and wanted to get some breakfast and i thought lets check out that rusty nail again what a great decision i think we all got one of the specials and they were all delicious mine came with some kind of homemade hash brown patties that were amazing the only downside is they only take cash thats not uncommon around here but they have an atm also there is often a wait on the weekends but for us it wasnt very long and they have free coffee outside for you while you wait well ok one more thing the actual restaurant is very small and kinda lopsided but hey id rather have a cheap delicious breakfast in a shitty place than pay more for a nicer atmosphere|on our recent visit to pittsburgh my family and i had breakfast at the rusty nail in bellevue dads hometown  the place is on the main street lincoln ave or up street as my family called itthey were quite busy on a saturday morning but we only waited about  minutes for a table  i enjoyed a sausage omelet with american cheese and my husband had a denver omelet  the omelets were well prepared and served with toast  potatoes were and extra  but a serving of potatoes was enough for two  breakfast for four adults was about  including tip  all adults had coffee or tea and a full breakfastthe service was friendly and prompt on the day we were there and coffee refills were offered readily  it is cramped quarters but typical for neighborhood nondiner breakfast joints in urban areaswe had a great diner breakfast in homey surroundings  we will definitely go back when visiting pittsburgh|place has amazing omelettes that are almost as big as the size of the plate you get a really big side of home fries too this is probably my favorite place for breakfast in pittsburgh i generally go in and get a seat right away without waiting service is usually fast and friendly two downsides to the place  they are cash only which can be an inconvenience i never remember to have cash until i get my bill so i have to run to the atm  the seating is limited and the tables are very close to each other so people there can most likely hear your conversations place overall is excellent and is worth a try at least for breakfast the lunches and dinner selections arent bad either|the food at joes rusty nail is great as the pictures will show the servingsportions are plentiful the service is quick and the staff personable i went there for breakfast and everyone in our group left sated as always i had my kid carnivores in tow and as is their custom they laid waste to everything edible that was put before them while they are a tad and i do mean tad  bit pricey i believe that the food is more than worth it the clientele what i can only believe are bellevue regulars are polite and inviting my breakfast was made well tasted great and dressed pretty as a picture i will tell you this is not my first rusty nail rodeo and lord willing it will not be my last as i say i vote with my feet and my usd and the staff at rusty nail can sleep well tonight knowing that my hard earned cash will continue to flow at joes and my feet will continue to bring me there hopefully more often than not|great home style breakfast sandwiches and dinner joe has something great going on here waitresses have been there for years as well and they are very good|wanted to try this neighborhood brunch spot and popped in this weekend its cash only and seat yourself so dont just stand there when you walk in like we did theres no hostess station so pick a table and sit down blend we sat down next to an elderly gentleman reading the newspaper in his steelers starters jacket thats the type of brunch place this isprices are very reasonable basic breakfasts eggs pancakes omlettes werent over  and even the specials were only  or i got the eggs benedict which is my goto however i didnt care for this version instead of hollandaise sauce the dish comes with cheese sauce not my favorite that it came on a thin english muffin either but our potatoes were good two options deep fried and pan fried with onions we got both and thought the deep fried were best can you blame ustotal bill for  came to  im looking forward to going back and trying some of their other breakfasts|the rusty nail is a neighborhood dinerstyle restaurant that serves pittsburghcentric comfort foods  meatloaf pasta and hot roast beef all grace the menui came here with my dad who ordered a hot roast beef and i ordered a bowl of spaghetti and meatballs  both meals were right around  and delicious  the portions were huge and the waitstaff was very friendlyim guessing it was the owner but a nice guy came around asking everyone how their food was and making small talk  nice touch|go there to get some authentic home made breakfast  they have breakfast special and price is very reasonable |i am a big fan of this little ice cream place  you can get both hard and soft ice cream so that satisfies myself and my daughter  they also have funnel cakes for my daughter that doesnt care for ice cream  the place is small but there is always a line and the dj outside plays the best oldies while you wait|this is an established neighborhood restaurant in the heart of bellevue  i found the place by accident when i made a trip to the lincoln bakery across the street you have to stop there also  old fashioned bakery with lots of very bad stuff if youre on a dietstreet parking only and you have to feed the meter  i also found that it is a cashonly restaurant as well  no hostess so you just walk in and seat yourselves  the wait staff consists mostly of older seasoned waitresses as they call themselves  and the ambiance isnt fancy at allthe pot roast thurs  sunday is to die for  when i offered my compliments to the chef joe the owner personally accepted it with a hearty handshake and a thank you and commented that he starts the pot roast on the days it is offered at  ami try to get there close to  pm  after that the place fills up with a lot of locals some of  whom related that they have been eating there for a long timei cant comment on breakfast or lunch but the menu offered a lot of different items so|i fell in love with this place as soon as we pulled up and saw the lights strung up and  oldies coming from the speakers i tried the banana cream pie hard ice cream their scoops are very generous my bf got the peach cobbler hard ice cream and that was to die for we got  servings of ice cream for  which nowadays is a steal imo  ill definitely be heading back with my coworkers this week|remember when i always do when i go to this ice cream shop the oldies playing and the best and biggest ice cream in pgh the large ice cream cone comes out the side door cause they cant fit out the windowwow its great and has been great for many many years been going there since i was a young young lad im now  and take my family there we love it keep up the good work|my family makes an event out of going to remember when to see doowop dan on saturday nights during the summer i usually go for the small cone which is comparable to most other ice cream places large the large cone is so large that is doesnt fit out of the window they have to bring it out the side door the ice cream is good the portions are generous and the atmosphere almost makes you forget you are in windgap  i highly recommend stopping by on a saturday night to see dan listen to some oldies and enjoy some ice cream|this is by far the best soft serve ice cream place in southwestern pa the flavor of the week is always interestingand tasty though i am somewhat disappointed that theyve switched to a lower grade ice milk for their vanilla and chocolate offerings i dont know if this is a matter of cutting corners or if the better stuff simply isnt available any longer either way this place is still leaps and bounds ahead of dq tastee freeze etc its definitely worth the trip its mostly street parking though they do have about  parking spaces off to the side serving sizes are huge the small cone here is the same size as a dq large and the large is so big they cant fit it through the windowthey hand it out the side doorif you want a real kodak momentorder a large cone for the kids and keep the camera and wet wipes handy|thank you kim and kurt it was very nice of you guys to take the time to post your reviews on our service we really

star herethere is a parking lot but its small and everyone parks crookedly so good luck  with that|ha the parking lot is good and yet nobody can ever park properly or politely this is a good distributor that is conveniently located wellstocked and has friendly staff it is a little unfortunate that the only cases that are kept in the cooler are the less exotic beers but their selection is fairly broad and the space is small so i wont dwell too much on that overall a decent beer shop as long as we are shackled to the idea of the distributor here in pa|ok full disclosure i know nothing about beer im a wine girl or a hardbooze girl but never a beer girl and yet somehow i wind up being the girl who is sent out to buy beer for the party full of random people at our house who all like different beerheres a rundown of what happened on a recent night that this occurred at pistellasme wanders around for  minutes overwhelmed with beer choices before giving up and going to the registerdude working at pistellas need helpme yes i do not drink this stuff but everyone coming to my house tonight does helpdude any idea what your friends likeme umm my husband likes to drink dos equis my one friend likes lighter beers oh and i am broke because i just bought a lot of chips and salsa at whole foodsdude girl just follow me here we are having a sale on the dos equis variety pack that has something for all of your friends it even has a christmas beer to make everyone get in the holiday spirit you will be the hero of the party and i will carry this to the register for you and everythingme thank youmy friends later that night girl you rock we are all happy with this beer and that leaves more vodka for youso that is why i choose pistellas when i am sent out on beer run because there are cool dudes working there who will help me not come home with a case of jacobs best nor does anyone give me crap for not understanding beer  i like that|we are fans of pistella beer distributors simply because we needed beer one night while visiting some friends and family in pittsburgh and they happened to be on the way to something we were doing  its a hole in the wall kind of facade but they do have a good selection  i dont remember the price being that expensive but looking at the average review so farit shows   im sure they have some nice stuff but we just got a case of beer i think one of those magic hat variety packs and it seemed similar to what we would pay in the other stores  anyway we had a good experience with this place and dont really have anything bad to say about them|this is my goto distributer they have a great selection and lots of hard to find brews i havent noticed that its any more expensive than going elsewhere but honestly if i dont buy here then im buying six packs which as we all know are a huuugggge rip off so any time i have a case of something i love i feel like im getting a bargain the cold selection does suck so i try to plan ahead and have what i need already cold staff here are all very helpful and will have recommendations if you ask|in my opinion this is the best distributor in the city the people running it are great the selection is very good and the prices are competitive with almost any other place ive been to because im not too picky i typically have been stopping right at the front to buy the discounted brew thats usually out of season you cant beat buying a case for  ill continue to go here for my beer needs until i leave the city|love these guys i have a huge picnic every year for my job and i always use pistella for my beverages  theyre nice folks always get the order right and its on time  ive also been to the store itself many times and they do indeed have a great selection|being from illinois and in town to attend a steelers game we needed beer  found out grocery stores only sell basically a  pack per personvisit nothing like illinois where the skys the limit so after that education we ended up here  good selection of beer when you need more quantities that  six packs  we stocked up on ic light and was reasonably priced  friendly service  only con is parking is scarce but that seems to be par for the course in pittsburgh  i would visit again if in the area|after trying a couple groomers in pittsburgh we found animal elegance they always took good care of our poodle clean poodle feet and an even cut you should try them too|i was a vet tech for  years so im pretty particular about people caring for my pets the groomer becky listened to what i wanted and did exactly what we had discussed my dog always seems quite happy and relaxed after a grooming there a really good sign also they are recommended by one of my favorite pet shops in pittsburgh smileys pet pad i wholeheartedly trust animal elegance to take proper care of my little furry friends|animal elegance is not much on the outside but the owner was very nice  listened to how i wanted my teacup poodle groomed and used the products that i requestedi was very happy with my services and i will return  my poodles groom was including tip which i think is very reasonable|i just moved to pittsburgh and i  took the word of other reviewers when making my decision to give animal elegance a try my two standard poodles looked great and seemed very happy after our visit i would have given amy and her crew five stars but the price was a good deal more than i am used to paying i had hoped to come back every two to three weeks but it is just too expenseive for that i may have to find another groomer for touch ups in between visits to animal elegancei feel like this is similar to a special occasion retaurant one where you would go all the time if the price was just a bit lower for regular customers|i use their services regularly they in fact are the only place i will take my dog gaffney the location is right off the main street  she is always extremely well groomed when they are done  they are worth the price|this place is the best we wont take our dog anywhere else for grooming its a very mom  pop type of place they genuinely cared for our puppy not to mention the perfect job they did on the cut and washing everyone who works here seems to treat the animals with the upmost care such a convenient location on butler street near lawrencevillle cant wait to go back thank you so much|this is my go to place to get my yorkiepoo groomed the surrounding area looks a little sad but lets face it lots of areas look like that here in pittsburgh inside however the place appears newer and well kept my dog has gotten consistently good haircuts here and shes always in a good mood when i pick her up thats a keeper in my books oh and the cost is about  which id say is average for most groomers ive gone to|i wound up here the other night after walking down the street because of a  minute wait at point brugge cafe  while my friends and i were leery of the prices on the menu the owner cajoled us into coming inside and were seated right away  im glad he did  the menu is rather expansive but mainly focuses on italian fare with an occasional jab at the more popular pointe brugge up the street mussels and friesit happened to be lasagna night  because i am used to the home cooked variety i had a hard time shelling out  for lasagna  i selected the wild mushroom and spinach option and it also came with the soup of the day which happened to be gumbo  both were very good  the gumbo had a very earthy taste along with good amounts of sausage jumbo lump crab and risotto mixed in  rather than being the layered the lasagna was one giant noodle the size of the entire plate stuffed with a generous amount of mushrooms and spinach folded over itself with marinara and cheese  didnt get a chance to try dessertboth items i had were rather tasty and i would easily come back here for a great meal|its a shame that some of the other reviewers had poor experiences i discovered pinos after deciding that the wait for point brugge simply wasnt worth itthe brunch was very good i enjoyed the atmosphere particularly the missing wall which gives the appearance of outdoor seating and particularly liked not having to sit shouldertoshoulder with other peoplemy sole comment would be that the owner who was very friendly should let his food speak for itself rather than being so concerned about the neighborhood competition|in similar fashion to joseph s i too decided to give pinos a shot once we saw how packed nearby point brugge which had initially drawn our party due to its reputation was it was a relatively nice evening and i thought the concept of freshair dining was too good to pass us by we were immediately greeted by jen one of the coowners as we entered i made it a point to compliment the beautiful inlaid tile in our tabletop and she volunteered some additional information about their production that i found to be very interesting i really loved the bistro burger i requested it to be prepared medium and sure enough it lived up to my expectationsyoud be surprised how many times ive ordered a medium burger only to have it served welldone and nearly bonedry at other restaurants nicole our waitress proved her weight in gold when she reassured me that gorgonzola would be a good cheese to accompany the bacon on the burger we also ordered the macaroni  cheese as an appetizer i thought the ziti was a bit dry but the sauce and cheese were delicious we really loved the bread and the garlic butter spread i was hoping for an oil  vinegar blend to have with the bread but the spread served as a surprisingly tasty alternative my partners ravioli looked delicious and he let me try one of his meatballs which i found to have that homemade flavor thats difficult to find at many restaurants our friend loved her arugula salad and as a seafood aficionado i was impressed by the very generous size of the shrimp she had our service was promptour water glasses had barely gone halfempty before our waitress scurried over to replenish them overall we loved our experience and will be back we were told about pinos legendary sunday brunches and i look forward to trying one myself the next sunday i have off from work|i must admit that the first time i went to pinos about  months ago i was not a fan for several reasons  however after coming home from brunch the experience was enough to not only completely change my mind but to keep me coming backmy boyfriend had the scallops and i have the pino benedict eggs benedict of course  my boyfriend literally looked like he was having a religious experience with the scallops  his eyes were closed he was moaning and it took him about  minutes to eat  scallops  he said it was the first time in his life that he ever wanted to take so much time to chew his foodmy dish was delicious and the inhouse made bread was fresh and savory  overall i am very pleased with the lunch menu and the range of dishes that are available  well definitely be back for brunch|enjoyed a wonderful evening eating outdoors on a perfect pittsburgh spring night  the charcuterie plate worked well as an appetizer for  and included a fantastic balsamic dressing  i had the best pasta and white clam sauce ive ever experienced and the other members of our party enjoyed their entrees as well  nice find in the point breeze neighborhood|i like this place so much unpretentious everything is made from scratch service is amazing lots of small plates great wine deals definitely worth a trip|my favorite italian restaurant in pittsburgh  alltime favorite dish  eggplant parmesan with their spicy arrabbiata sauce i had to ask for them to make it that way  not your typical layers of fried heavy eggplantlighter chunkier eggplant that melts in your mouth  my favorite appetizer there is the sizzling olivesthey bring you a little cast iron skillet and throw olives in itthey soften and are so wonderful to eat  flavor explodes in your mouth  also good is ther roasted veggie platter and charcuterie plate  we typically go on less crowded days as the restaurant is smallbut weve always had excellent service and the food comes out hot and fresh|six of us went to dinner six of us had fabulous meals  my husband said his seafood fra diavlo was the best he ever ate not a bit fishyloaded with fresh seafood and a spicy sauce  my son had the carbonara which he described as fabulous  my daughter had the roasted veggie platter as her meal it is a large appetizer and i also sampled itthe vegetables and olives were marinated and grilled perfectly  my father had the skirt steak which he loved and my son had a sausage pizza  both said they were delish  i usually get the eggplant parmesan with their spicy arribiata sauce but this time i had a pasta dish loaded with artichokes and shrimp in a spicy sauce  it was excellent  it was my fathers birthday and they brought out a tiramisu for us to share we didnt even ask for it and that was luscious as well  the staff was as nice as can bewe will be back without a doubti love this place|god this is the best eggplant that i have ever tasted  was what our friend said after he took his first bite of the sicilian eggplant served at pinos  my husband couldnt wait to have the seafood fra diavlo which he had last timeagain a  out of   i had the roasted veggie platter for my entree which is really an appetizerand i had to shareway too much for one person to eat  another comment from our friend who was a first timer at pinos was that it was the best italian dressing that he ever had  as i write i want to go back for dinner tonightforgot to mention they also have local beers on tap east end brewery the men enjoyed the homewood brew dark lager type beer its great to see the owners supporting local businesses|i went to pinos to celebrate a friends birthday on a thursday night  i hadnt been in pinos since they renovated but i have to say that they made the interior beautiful  we made reservations but i dont think we would have needed them since there was just a few other parties seated when we came in  my two girlfriends and i always have a tough time deciding what to orderso naturally we order one of everything that looks good  we started with the charcuterie platter which was a mix of absolutely delicious prosciutto capicola and soppressata with a bit of veggies and mozzarella  this was an impressive way to start out the meal  we all wanted to try the seasonal ravioli which was pumpkin too tempting for three certified pumpkin fanatics so we got an order to share as an appetizer  this was unlike other pumpkin ravioli ive hadvery pumpkiny  the ravioli was good although we all agreed that we wouldnt have been able to eat a whole order  it was very sweetly spiced and i was missing a little bit of savory with the dish  i ordered the grilled sausage pizza for my entree and was pleased with it  i admittedly never get too excited about pizza and this was good but nothing that i was dreaming about later that night  overall the food was a  for me  the service was outstanding  our waiter was very welcoming and knowledgable  my friends got dessert and when the chef i assume chef pino came over to ask how it was my friend jokingly said that it was delicious but would be perfect with a bit of sauce  before she could take another bite he whisked both of the desserts away and added fresh strawberries and sauce saying that he would be serving the dish that way for now on  talk about service  the whole experience was fantastic service gets a   added bonus  awesome beer selection some brews i havent seen  only place ive been that had east end homewood reserve on tap for me to try exciting for a beer dork like me and it is tasty by the way|another really good meal here  my friend and i went for soup and appetizersand licked the plates clean  gazpacho pasta fagiole homemade bread eggplant with mozzarella and my favoritethe roasted veggie platter  so much food we didnt think we would eat it but it was so good we did  they also had their doors open and we were able to sit outside in the cool summer airgreat way to kick of summer|i ate here this past friday with my girlfriend and two other dining companions  we decided to come here because it was pittsburgh restaurant week and they offered a special  course  fixed price menu with  course wine pairing for   it ended up being a small little restaurant in the middle of point breeze which i had been past many times previously but never really noticedthe restaurant was swamped whenever we got there probably due to a combination of it being friday night and restaurant week so thankfully we had made reservations and were seated almost immediately  i decided to start off my meal with a salad while my girlfriend had the tomato garlic bisque  my salad was good and came with goat cheese pears and a vinaigrette which all tasted nicely  it was nothing amazing but i think it takes a really special salad to be amazing  i also tried my girlfriends bisque and unsurprisingly found it to be a bit tomatoy since i do not enjoy tomatoes very much but she really enjoyed it  for my entree i decided to get two small plates instead of a larger entree and settled on the mac n cheese and fish tacos  the tacos were a bit sloppywet but had some nice flavors cilantro aoili and pico in them along with some chili sauce that gave it a nice little kick  my mac n cheese came out in its own little cast iron type pot and was good  there was an adequate amount of cheese throughout and i liked that they even had some ricotta buried inside the dish  i was also able to try the arrabbita that one of our dining companions had ordered  wow was it good and it packed quite the spicy punch too  immediately i regretted not ordering it although i still did enjoy my two small plates  for my dessert course i ended up having the white chocolate creme brulee  my girlfriend decided upon the tiramisu while another at our table had the peaches and puff pastry  all of the desserts seemed large and made sure that we did not go home hungry  my creme brulee tasted decently and ended up being a good finish to my mealthe bottom line for me is that i would definitely head back here in the future  their regular menu seemed reasonably priced and everything that i had tried throughout the night was good|i decided to try pinos due to the restaurant week special and boy am i glad that i did my husband and i made reservations for four on friday night we were seated almost immediately on the lovely outdoor patio area it was a great night to be outside although the restuarant is small the ambiance is wonderful i could tell thet the guests around me were enjoying themselves as wellthe table decided to order the  course menu for  because of the large amount of options we each decided on a different entree so that we were able to share and get a good idea of all the restaurant has to offer i started off with a mixed green salad with grileld pears walnuts and goat cheese the pears had a nice smokeyness about them that complimented the sweet vinagarette for my entree i chose the arrabiata with rigatoni the dish was very good but much more spicy than i had expected i feel that they should have informed me of this or explained the spice level on the menu luckily i enjoy spicy food but i was unable to finish the entree due to the spice level it was slightly less spicy when i finished it for lunch the next day my husband had the veal and risotto which he loved for dessert i orderedthe peach mille feuille the portion size was enormous and the peaches were ripe and tasty however the marscapone filling hardly tasted of marscapone i had the opportunity to try my husbands white chocolate tiramisu and was pleasantly surprised by the light but still rich flavors our dinner guests also seemed to enjoy their choices as well overall i would definitely recommend pinos for a nice romantic date night out in point breeze however i wish they offered the  course menu as a regular feature|new fall items on the menutheir grilled romaine salad is fabulous|the freshbaked bread and sundried tomato puree is outstanding we started with the crab cakes which was one of the lightest ive had i could eat a vat of the lemon aioli itself we followed with veal and ricotta meatballs that were perfectly cooked we finished with their italian fries i would order these every single time now that ive had them once twice cooked herbs garlic confit basil aiolievery single element of the dish is fantasticif you plan on visiting then make sure you have some time to really take in the drink list and menu there are always a handful of new recommended wines to try and a signature cocktail of the week which might i add is usually extremely fun and concocted with unique ingredients i am impressed with the cleanliness decor and ambiance of the restaurant i love the feel when the french doors are completely open i also enjoyed our bartender eamonn who was funny polite and attentive he is also a master of not only creating fresh new tasty cocktails but simply understands the right way to mix and serve a drinkoverall i would love to keep pinos as our little secret but would urge you to try it too|stopped in without a reservation around  pm i ordered the house soup it was very yummy the soup was a tomato based soup with noodles and chick peas i also tried the sausage flatbread the flatbread sizing easily fed one my boyfriend shared with me the tomato sauce and peppers on it really made the flatbread i really one to come back int the summer when the front windows are opened and enjoy some wine and small dishesa|there was absolutely nothing not to like  reasonably priced wines home style italian cooking great upbeat ambience|i live in connecticut and visit family in pittsburgh often pinos is my favorite pittsburgh restaurant i dont have one favorite dish because i usually order one of the specials which change often i ordered from the regular menu for the first time a couple of weeks ago the bolognese sauce on tagliatelle pasta i think the menu has it on rigatoni was as good as what i had in italy my son had the seafood risotto it was so good i need to order it next timemy brother is a retired chef and hates to eat out because few restaurants are worth paying for what he can make better at home he loved his meal and his tastes of everyone elses at the table there were  of us he was giddy to enjoy eating out for the first time in in a long timeoh they also make great cocktails and have a very very nice wine listoh if you think you can only get good fries and mussels at the belgium place around the corner try pinos the fries are topped with crispy herbs yumno it isnt cheap but im happy to pay for quality|i had read some mixed reviews but i honestly dont understand the negative feedback this was our first time and we found street parking right around the corner we made the  reservations only  days in advance and the place was about half full when we got there and very full by  with some folks eating at the bar we were seated within minutes at a great table near the front window it was nice and private so we could talk with our friends water and bread was on the table within minutes with drinks shortly behind we ordered the beans and green and italian fries as appetizers the beans and greens were good but ive had better the italian fries which seemed to be fries with flash fried kale and garlic with a pesto mayo were unbelievably good i had the del sol pasta and it was very flavorful though a little salty the chicken was very moist and the sauce was very good my husband had the cacciatore special and said the chicken was very good but they sauce could have been a bit more flavorful the service was very good the entire night i would like to go back and try the pizza or flat bread|i went with ladies of dine  dish to pinos in january it was good solid food  it is located in the quaint neighborhood of point breeze the service was a bit lacking but it got the job done|we had dinner and drinks tonight and it was great as usual we have been here often with couples with family and for a large family event service and food have always been top notch|had a really nice casual dinner at the bar with great wine great service at a nice neighborhood place the wild mushroom arugula flatbread was wonderful|great neighborhood spot the staff is attentive and friendly the food is awesome and the ambiance is perfect we had a great experience here the mussels were flavorful and my steak main course was perfect i totally recommend pinos|one of my favorite places to eat while in pittsburgh if your in the shady side area or bakery square area this is one of the place you need to check out great servicegreat foodgreat people|great neighborhood restaurant with charming atmosphere and awesome foodonly possible complaint could be that the lamb bolognese serving was a little skimpybut thats because it was perfection|omg the most delicious meal we started with a calamari appetizer that my husband agrees to but never really likes and he couldnt stop asking for more unique and delicious and a very large portion this is something you want to split but so reasonably priced considering we both had the rosemary brined chicken with a mushroom demi glac and smashed potatoes the presentation was delightful and the the food was so good delicious  chicken was sliced thinly but yet tender and flavors melded wonderfully to beat that was the chocolate mouse  the chef specializes in pastries and there are not words made yet to describe the desert we had we only know we are going to be going back  many times thank you pinos|went for a quick dinner tonight and couldnt be happier  i had the tuna and my son had the carbonara pasta  both were excellent  i love the neighborhood atmosphere  the meals are pricey but very good|i am so glad my daughter aunt and myself  took a chance and tried this restaurant liz the waitress was so helpful and friendly we had great wine and delicious meals it was also a nice touch that the chef came to our table to meet and greet if you love homemade pasta you will love this restaurant we will definitely be back|paul is a classic old world barber hes a oneman operation and has been in the neighborhood for decades older guys will come around and sometimes shoot the breeze speaking in italian he often remembers details about your family from stories you share from year to yeara real personal touch paul charges about  plus tip for a regular mens haircut making him a great bargain compared with the competition|paul is a very friendly chap who takes his time with the haircutits a steal for  and feels good to go down a notch and slow life down for half an hour|this is perhaps the best mechanic shop in pittsburgh  it is ran by two brothers and may not look like much but they offer excellent service honest work and great pricing  recently i brought my truck in after another shop said i needed a litany of repairs  at brunos they did only the necessary work and even fixed the ignition switch which had worn out and only charged me for the part  these guys are great but they are usually backed up with work so you may have to schedule in advance|cant recommend this barber highly enough  i was in town and walked over here  i realized that they only take cash but paul pirollo just says dont worry about it bring it later  there were two guys waiting ahead of me  it took a while because he does such a good job  he was familiar with both men and very friendly  when he cut my hair he took his time and asked my opinion in a considerate way  he detailed the edges of my hair with hot foam and a straight razor and used some sort of eucalyptussmelling post shave ointment in talking to him i found out that he has been in this location for  years  in all those years he has gotten damn good at his job i told him ill be right back with the money and he said dont worry about it come back with it any day  i did come right back with it and gave him a  tip on a haircut that cost  but he really deserved more for this milliondollar haircut|brunos is by far the best garage ive ever taken my car to either here in pittsburgh or in los angeles where i used to live i drive a  saab so believe me i have a lot of experience getting my car repaired the two brothers who own brunos are great they are very knowledgeable theyre very willing to help you and above all theyre honest which ive found is a  rare commodity when it comes to mechanics i cannot possibly recommend brunos highly enough|absolutely amazing guys here we were in pittsburgh visiting my family and the drivers seatbelt stopped working day after thanksgiving and these guys got us in despite obviously being incredibly busy  it turns out that a piece of plastic had gotten stuck in the buckle now we are able to drive home thanks|it is the best mechanic shop i have been to in pittsburgh  i went there every year for inspections and every time my car had a problem  absolutely excellent service the most valuable things that i have found about this shop is the honesty and great price as other people mentioned in their reviews  the brothers who work there are very nice and honest they are always ready to help  there are a couple of times when it was just a tiny problem with my car they fixed my car without charging me and even refused to take my tip  they always explained to me what problem my car had gave me recommendations and found the least costly way to fix it  the only thing i wish they couldve done better is setting up voicemail function for their phone as the phone doesnt work sometimes however they are always in the shop from monday to friday when i drop by even after i get off work at night around    its not easy to find trustworthy mechanics i feel pretty lucky  definitely recommend to those who are looking for a good mechanic shop in pittsburgh|the best most honest and reliable car guys in the burgh i lived in pittsburgh for eight years and still have family there i drive in from out of state so these guys can do work for me|bastone offered me a fair price for the work they did  i took it there to get a second opinion and despite the fact that they have a sign saying they charge for checkups it was free  they quickly got back to me telling me what had to be done and what they recommended giving detailed reasoning behind itat no point did i feel like they were trying to cheat me or upsell me  and they were the cheapest place i checked out|great service i had my tail light replaced and had it bought online other places said that they wouldnt install something that wasnt bought at their place bastone finished the work very quickly and did a great job great service and value|i was passing through pittsburgh and discovered a headlight was out  i found bastone through yelp and drove over  they fixed the light on the spot charging me   first impressions are great  very clean repair shop and the service for this minor repair was done in a friendly and welcoming manner|i have taken my cars to bastones for years and would highly recommend them  always friendly always courteous never trying to sell me on unnecessary work   i really appreciate their honesty and their help in keeping my old car working and on the road|love this place really nice people willing to help and pretty decent prices|bastone is the best auto service i have found in the us  i have trusted my car to them for all the years i have been in pittsburgh and i do not plan on changing them  they are very professional logical prices and they make everything possible to meet your time schedule if you ask them for  they even give some perks for loyalty customers eg free oil change for every  oil changes you do there  of course this means every  years but still  the also have a shuttle to drop you off i have never used it but i have seen other people using it  however because they are so good they are very busy too so make an appointment ahead of time  they are also not open during weekends|bastone was able to get my car into the shop the very day i was out looking to get my car repaired carl the man who assisted me was very friendly addressed all my concerns and called me with an estimate before doing work front end and alignment compared to the horror stories you can read online their prices are very reasonable i picked up my car a few hours later and the steering is tight deadcenter and hasnt felt this good to drive since i bought it i will definitely be returning if any other problem with my car arises nice work guys|perfect place i needed help today and they helped meno chargejust asked me to do something nice for somebody else today|the guys at bastone are great everyone is friendly and knowledgable weve brought our car in several times for both regular

a huge grocery storeand its close to cmu and upittsmriti|i been going to this place since the s and this place is the middle class ge i stopped going to this place since i got a job at whole foods my mom went here a two weeks ago for the first tine in a long time she say that the people are still there and the place looks better and the people are a lot friendly now so if you dont what too shop at a middle class food store in east liberty then go to the market in shadyside|i will admit i am completely biased towards this place i grew up eating their pizza crust is soft and fluffy not chewy the cheese is a little thicker than the average new york style pizza place the sauce has spice but not too much at some places you need a little milk or water to cool your tongue their one downside is that theyre not always consistent some days its just started to turn golden brown others its over done|eaten here twicebut only pizza i do have to say its up there with napolis or ailleos as for the pizza tonight me and my neighbors were up for some more was disappointed when ordering a meatball hoagie to find out they had no meatballs pizza places should never run out of certain things had gotten a cheese hoagie didnt get get why someone would order this but was told it was good didnt like luckily the pep pizza was great but when u get toward the crust its all dough still kick butt pizza but get rid of the cheese hoagie|according to urbanspoon blasphemy i know their are like  pizza places in pittsburgh so what is the best pizza in pittsburgh everyone has an opinion and so here is mine the best pizza in pittsburgh is the pie comes from the place in you neighborhood that has quality ingredients fair prices and friendly service eddies pizza place  is all of these things and

impeccable|was referred here by my mechanic to have my front bumper replaced had it done quickly and inexpensively even drove my wife to work when she dropped it off called on my way there to pick it up and asked about an estimate on a scratch along the side of my car when i got there they had an estimate printed out but they just finished buffing out the scratch and touching it up for free looks great also compounded my headlights because they were yellowing for free very impressed|super nice guys they ended up doing a number of simple things for free and theyre not afraid of complex jobs if you need help with your door hinges come here|great results great people great customer service ive brought my car in to this shop three times and my husband has used it once they do excellent honest work here and are so friendly and knowledgeable that i know i can come in for car body advice at any time i wish i could give them more business but im leaving the state will miss this place never thought id say that about a body shop|as a chinese american college student from nyc who got stuck in pittsburgh with its useless public transportation circa  i desperately missed homestyle chinese food for the better part of my first two years here things turned around for me once i got a car or made friends with cars but i was seriously hurting for a whiletasty was one of the places we found back in the day it was owned and ran by a typical restaurantowning chinese family they had the works  pushy lao ban niang boss lady chef slash dad and during school offhours junior high school daughter manning the cashier if they were in nyc theyd only be missing an ami a bus boy the food was pretty good and if you order in chinese the lao ban niang hooked you up with extras because your parents teach you good to talk chineees im pretty sure tasty is under new ownership now the food isnt as good as it was but the restaurant still gives off the homestyle look and feel its a small restaurant with enough seating for about  patrons cheap tables cheap seats after all restaurant extras are just a waste of money the customers should come back for the food this is a restaurantthe new

and have been coming since they were in their old location when sears was still there before home depot was builtventos is located in the east liberty section of pittsburgh right next to home depot they have been in business forever they are a pizza and hoagie shop they are famous for their italian army hoagie i have friends that as soon as they land in pittsburgh they come straight to ventos

tables and booths for seating you can even play the pa lottery there no debit or credit cards cash onlyfyi there is a generic atm that charges  to make a withdraw|this is a little hong kong restaurant gem in shadysidebut first a disclaimer if your idea of classic chinese food runs to general tso or kung pau chicken chow mein egg rolls or perish the thought  crab rangoon then this place is really not for you although much of the business this place does is takeout delivery of the type of american chinese dishes i mentioned above the forte of tasty chinese restaurant is real hong kong style food  unfortunately a great deal of what is on their regular menu and with the delivery services is comprised of the american version  of chinese foodthe first time i came to this place they only gave me the american iced menubut having lived in the bay area for many years i scoped out the hong kong style menu and vowed to order from it the next time i went to tasty and i didnow i just  pick up the hong kong menu automatically when i come intheir hong kong dishes are some of the best ive had in pittsburghthe garlic eggplant in a velvety sauce combines the right hint of spiciness with sweet and virtually melts in your mouththe salted squid whats usually known as salt and pepper squid has a light crispy coating with a minimum of oil and the texture of the squid isjust a tiny bit chewy but not too much sotexture in squid is a daunting thing to get just righti am a chow fun freak anyway  but their shrimp chow fun with egg sauce is the best ive ever tasted with slightly charred noodles fresh dhrimp and a wonderful egg scramble sauce  recently i had a friend visiting from san francisco and took him here kind of a test to see if my view of this place was somehow off and he raved about everything especially this chow fun dishto sum upif you want to experience the best of tasty please order from the hong kong menusince i dont order american chinese dishes here i cant comment on them but i guess the genius of this place is authentic south chinese dishes as evidenced by the chinese families ive seen eating here not the usual  pseudo chinese dishes many people seem to order herei expect the chefcook here just doesnt have his heart in crab rangoon or chow mein|i love the history and the atmosphere albert vento is in myron copes book and is a staple in da burgh  he started

to order but it comes out fresh and hotpizza is square cut and the corners are the best|my cousin works here and thats the only reason i know about this place the crust they use for the bread is so light and airy and i absolutely love it it makes the eating experience that much more enjoyablei always order a slice or two with sausage and mushrooms because i love the little crumbly sausage that they add to the pizza plus if you dip it in ranch big fattie it taste even better i took the hubby there just this week and he agreed that it is very good they have tons of specials and even more menu options we ordered the medium pie and  hoagie for only  really good deal and the italian hoagie was not too bad i do wish however that it was a little thicker maybe add some more lettuce and tomatoes for fullness by the time we got it home it was like eating a lunch meat sandwich still delicious but i would have like a little more bite in my hoagiethe interior is a little outdated but they have a bunch of steeler memorabilia hanging up also if you like to play the lottery they have a small window for buying and playing the numbers waste of money if you ask me but to each his own btw its cash only here but they do have an atm|this is a pittsburghshadyside institutionwhat can i say this place is goodeatin basic italian food  not spectacular but when you want a good nuthinfancy dinner this

they are flat out wrong|i like this place its rarely as busy as the getgo doesnt play stupid grocerystore point pricing games they have diesel now and a pretty decent automatic car wash that is priced just right its also conveniently on the right side of the road when im heading westbound on baumother than that its just a gas station but hey at least i can clean my car here|mikes auto body is fantastic not only do the do great work but the experience is great to the shop is clean and comfortable they have a contests with enterprise so you can pick up and drop off a rental there they even give you a can of glass cleaner and snacks when you pick up your car they have fantastic customer service|blown away at how mikes turned an awful situation into a very unexpectedly pleasant experience  lets face it  everyone hates taking their car to the shop  especially when the reason you have to is bc you were in an accident on the return trip from the airport after your amazing vegas vacation no injuries or serious damage to either involved party thankfullythe customer service is stellar  the staff at mikes genuinely love their jobs and its evident pleasing their customers is priority one  i have to echo my fellow yelpers as my car left mikes in better shape than before the accident when i drove my freshly cleaned and waxed hatchback back hatchback backlol to bloomfield i swear i could feel how happy baby bluey was and all was forgiven with the fenderbenderdid i mention they left a gift bag full of goodies on the passenger seat all pinkthemed  my only small complaint is my car wasnt ready when originally told but is it ever ill def be back to mikes|i had to choose from a list of insuranceapproved body shops to get my car repaired after an accident mikes auto body was nearby and more highly rated than other convenient options they did not disappoint the turnaround time was quick less than  days and they did a great job my car looks as though the accident never happened and i am quite pleased with the work they had to fix a large dent and some scraped paintthe neighborhood the shop is located in is not great some interesting characters soliciting in the intersection nearby but the shop itself is clean and comfortable i did not feel unsafe going to and from the shop in daylightthe customer service was excellent as well everyone i interacted with was professional and courteous i was continually updated with progress on my repairs and they were actually finished a day earlier than expected i hope i dont need to go back to mikes for repairs but i would definitely choose them again in the event of an accident|i was rearended with not too serious damage in july   since my car is new i really wanted my dealer to do the repairs  geico sent me to mikes and since their claims adjuster was in situ as was enterprise this was too easy to pass  up  i was dubious but they really did an excellent job  they finished in only a few days they were polite and my car was clean when i picked it up neighborhood is sketchy but i didnt have any problems id recommend this place to anyone|the people that work here make an unfortunate incident a breeze to work through  i woke up one morning to find a note attached to my windshield to inform me that i was the victim of a hit and run  the damage was minimal but after calling it into my insurance company they directed me to come herewithin minutes of me hanging up my phone with the insurance company my phone was ringing to indicate that mikes was calling to set up an appointment to get my car in for an estimate  i set up an appointment that was convenient for me and went about my daywhen i arrived here to have my car viewed it was quite the easy task  my wait was minimal the staff were polite and i wasnt being jerked around  within five minutes of them looking at my car i was out the door and heading back to my place  unfortunately they did not do any work to my vehicle at this point because the police are still looking into the person that hit my car  but if we get to that step i am confident that they could not do anything wrong in my eyes  if their body work for a vehicle is anything like their customer service they are definitely one of the best places to go in the cityyes people this isnt the best neighborhood in the city but get over it|mikes took my car after horrible repairsservice from kenny ross south  the service was great and i even got to meet the owner who came out to personally speak with me on a busy friday afternoon  great guys there|i had a great experience taking my vehicle to mikes for repair after a fender bender i used the geico express service  i booked the estimate and repair online for the next day when i dropped off my car they were expecting me it took less than  minutes and every single person i encountered at the shop was helpful and friendly and showed concern for me the damage was minor and the repairs took less than  hours to complete my policy provides a rental car and enterprise was there when i checked in with my vehicle and the rental process was streamlined and easy when i picked up my repaired car it was just as efficient and friendly getting into an accident is frustrating and inconvenient and costly but mikes auto body made the process of fixing things and getting me back on the road into a good experience i wish more businesses treated their customers like mikes treated me|mikes doesnt really need another stellar review on here but ill give them another one anywayim a choir director at a church and after rehearsal a few weeks ago one of my choir members ran into my car in the parking lot and crunched the rear bumper bummeri had never had to file an insurance claim before and wasnt really sure what to expect dealing with mikes was about as easy as it gets i called to set up an appointment for the estimate and drove down a few days later i was only there about  minutes and got sent on my waya few days after that monday i took my car in for the repair it did take a couple days longer than they said which is really the only negative thing i can say about mikes but considering i didnt have to pay for the rental car it wasnt a huge deal when i did get my car back thursday like others have said it was in even better condition than when i took it in besides the dent of course they had cleanedwaxed the outside and even cleaned and detailed the inside if they just did detailing i would take my impreza there every time mikes rules|mikes did an awesome job on my srx after i dented it backing into my garage the insurance claim  adjuster was on site as well as one of mikes professionals to meet me when i brought the car in  they reviewed the damage  gave me a solid estimate and took the car right then they kept me informed of the progress of the repair the car looks amazing and they even left a gift bag in the car with a variety of  car care products and other good things as a thank you  the repair took a little longer than originally estimated but the quality of workmanship was well worth the wait thank you mikes|they did a  fantastic job on my car i did not go through insurance so of course it cost more than i was hoping also my car was in the shop an extra day or two than expected but do not get me wrong they do quality work fair price and paul and both of the receptionists i spoke with are as friendly as can be they even fixed things that a different body shop in texas messed up on mikes body shop fixed their mistake for under  i highly recommend them to anyone even tho they are not in the best of neighborhoods they do quality work for a reasonable price and they even wash vacuum and buff your car for free ps they warranty all of their work the entire time you own your vehicle|hands down one of the most friendliest and honest body shop around they look me square in the eyes and told me what was up with my vehicle i was hit by another individual and their insurance company told me to come here they are highly regarded in the bbb and i know why they even washed and polished my car inside and out only reason i didnt give it a five was that enterprise was the one who contacted me about my carand that was because they wanted theirs back otherwise go here|like all the other yelpers i took my car here for the convenience and because they were listed as approved by my insurancei will never take my car anywhere else now for body workthey are a very honest shop and they do quality work  i even took my car there for some cosmetic upkeep not through insurance  paul went through and found the cheapest solution possible for me knowing i was self pay thanks to all there|i took my car here after a pretty nasty fender bender i was involved in i initially came here because they were approved and recommended by my insurance carrier geico all i can say is how over the top impressed i was with the entire operation first off the area i was greeted in was very clean and welcoming i was treated promptly and respectfully by the staff given a realistic quote including some extra work i wanted to have done while the car was being worked on i know some people on here have complained about the work taking extra time but mine was done a little sooner than anticipated it was the morning of instead of end of the day quoted but ill take it the car looked amazing too the work was absolutely top notchthe kicker for me though was i did not have rental policy on my insurance so mikes provided me with a loaner car for the duration of the repairs what amazing customer service i cant recommend these guys highly enough|i never grew up with a pet so getting one was a new experience i had always heard killnokill shelters whatever i got my new dog crosby from arl which happens to be a kill shelter thinking about this i felt truly good getting him there because i felt as though i was saving him from some other destiny however he is so cute that im sure someone else would have adopted himthe shelter itself is large and the volunteers and vettechs that you interact with are very friendly the dogs are constantly walked and you can tell the animals receive a ton of love from the staff adoption is made easy unless you rent in which case you should probably bring a letter from your landlord stating you are allowed to adopt another perk is that when crosby had kennel cough we went after hours to get him some medication and they still let us in and treated himin short great adoption experience at arl|this shelter is fantastic and has generally very good friendly people on staff  the cats and dogs appear to be treated at least as well as one might expectwhen i adopted one of my cats at this establishment i had to return the next day to have her spayed  they did it for free which was great but the reason they dont get five stars is that the desk clerk completely forgot about my cat and me and she left us waiting as she chatted on her cell phone with a friend she only remembered about us as she was walking out for a smoke and saw us sitting in the lobby|had a great experience at mikes i backing into a loading dock which completely shattered my taillight and dented my side panel im a college student so naturally i was very upset and worried to see how much it would cost they made me feel comfortable and gave me a great price for the repair which only took a couple of hours definitely would go back again|this is an animal shelter with a tremendous heart while i realize its more popular to back the more selective aka nokill shelters around pittsburgh the open door policy places the arl at the top of my list where the socalled nokill shelters can afford to be choosy and accept allstar pets the arl will accept any pet from a private owner someone who finds a stray or even the citys animal control a small overextended staff collaborates with a dedicated troop of volunteers and manages to adopt thousands and thousands of pets each year into family homes i have adopted two cats from this shelter and also participated in the adoption of several friends pets here too the paid staff can be spread a little thin especially if you come on a friday afternoonevening or a weekend morning guess what lots of people want to adopt a pet on the weekend when they have extra time to help it settle in so dont be surprised to find crowds of potential adopters and exhausted staff for a quieter experience try a weekday for the most intimate petfinding experience go during a steelers game seriously you will have the place to yourself is it sacrilegious to tell you to do anything during a steelers game whoops the arl lists some of their pets on petfinder but i have found that the selection on the adoption floor is often too vast  quick moving for them to keep the profiles online updated  what im trying to get at is this dont get super attached to a pet online because theres a reasonable chance it already has a home and dont avoid a trip because you dont see anyone you like online there are more future furfriends waiting for you at the shelter the staff of volunteers is extraordinary  i adopted one of my cats directly out of a foster home and the volunteer must have gone out of her way to come to the shelter at my convenience and explain all the inhome habits of my future baby i had such a positive experience with her and the shelter they invite you to send updates and pictures as your new pet adjusts yes the staff  volunteers have a vested interest in the pets and want to know how things go the rates for adoption vary depending on the season so if your finances require some help to acquire your new best friend keep an eye on their website for info about sales you can also donate old sheets towels pet carriers and toys for the animals who stay here on their way to permanent homes i donate a big pile of worn towels and sheets every time i sort my linen closet they also accept cah donations to help keep up with expenses maybe i seem like an overenthusiastic cheerleader of this place but the fact is that this organization connected me with two very important cats in my life and every scratch on my arms every litter box and every furcovered outfit in my life is due credit to their tireless efforts bravo arl the pets  their families thank you|i adopted my dog paco a pitbull mix on memorial day weekend he was a crazy wild dog that had been returned twice before he clearly needed some work but was a sweet handsome boy and i couldnt pass him up the arl offered us help in free obedience classes and also offered us a donated crate we ended up taking him to pat moloneys k academy to finish his training and with a lot of hard work and dedication he is a fantastic dog and a great companionthe arl facility was very nice and clean the staff was helpful and it is a product of its volunteers for sure they were all helpful and seem to know paco as we walked him out of the shelterthings i liked most about the arlhelpful staff  volunteersclean environmentmeet  greet roomsoutside play area to observe the dog off leashonsite vetclinicsmall store to purchase necessitiesonsite training and helpful tips from staff regarding trainingthey care all of them from staff to volunteer they all care and it showsthings i dislikednothing|i have an almost threeyearold cat named jack that i spoil as if he were my son i honestly never experienced the love for and from an animal until i adopted jack from an animal rescue league it was one of the best decisions ive ever madethe shelter is great and ill probably get another cat in the near future check this location out|im a crazy cat lady and proud of it being a volunteer here has been so fulfilling on many different levels  it has made me feel so good to be able to help out with something that i feel passionately about  you can tell that the staff puts a lot of effort into taking care of these animals they accept in  a lot of times people will say oh i cant do it its too sad  but the thing is its not  its actually so great because these animals come here and find loving homes instead of being on the street or in an environment thats toxic  i rarely see animals there for a long time  i think thats a testament to the way they are treated while theyre in the facility now ill admit im not the biggest dog fan so i help out in the cat shelter  i can talk about that with a lot more knowledge than the dog side  they just built a new cat facility on their property so they have their own shelter  the cats are all set up in a huge room  they have two rooms for people to play with the cats when they are looking to adopt them  these rooms are also used for cat cuddling  thats what i do when i volunteer  i get to take the cats out so that they can play be cuddled or just run around  then the cats are able to get out of the cages and get used to human contact the other great thing about the arl is that they have foster parents who take in cats and dogs while theyre waiting to be adopted  this way they get a great home environment and it relieves the facility of having too many animals at one time at different points in the year the adoption rates are different depending on the amount of animals they have  cat rates are usually cheaper in the springsummer because theres more coming in and dog rates are cheap in the late summer months  the added bonus of adopting a pet from the arl is that they are spade or neutered when you adopt them  its actually cheaper then taking them to a normal vet on your own i would strongly recommend coming here to check out the animals and hopefully find your next furry friend  or you can volunteer  they have volunteer informational sessions the first saturday of every month  after that you only have one training session to complete and youre ready to volunteer  just check it out if youre curious  you wont regret it  your new furry friends will appreciate it as well|a few years ago i decided that i wanted to get a pet and so i volunteered at the arl for a number of months in order to learn about the different breeds of cats and dogs it was an invaluable experience and really helped me to learn about dog behavior i still serve as a cat foster from time to timethe staff here have a tough and sometimes heartbreaking job its not  for the faint of heart but theyre all very nice and do their best by the animals and the people who come in to adopt and surrender the poor beastsultimately i didnt get my doggy from the arl sometimes the heart doesnt get give you a choice but my experiences there have really taught me a lot about animals and have only served to heighten my love for my yr old rescue pup|great place to find a dog or a cat|i adopted another cat in february and both my cats are the best of friends it took a while to get there but trust me theyre pals nowadopt an animal today|on july th our family was delighted to adopt bubbles from the animal rescue league  she is a wonderful well mannered eager to please dog over the past year we have been looking for just the right dog for our household  which includes  generations and a cat who rules  we had visited arl a few times in the past year the staff and volunteers have always been friendly and knowledgeable about the animals  they truly care about matching each cat or dog with the right  forever home  i am horrified by the vehemence of the july  negative review posted  yes the arl is not perfect but the staff and volunteers are terribly overwhelmed and they honestly try to do their best  the solution lies in  more volunteers and more funding  i highly recommend going to arl when you want to adopt a pet or wish to volunteer your time to a very worthy organization|i volunteer as a dog coach twice a week and i am absolutely in love with the arl there are two beautiful babies whom i have walked for weeks that i wanna mention these ladies would be mine if i didnt already have a grumpy basset and an elderly shiz zhu  homebunny my girl bunny ears and the sweetest temperamenthttpwwwanimalrescueorgavailablepetshoney i love her to death  years old just wants to be lovedhttpwwwanimalrescueorgavailablepetsstop by the arl it is worth the trip |i have gotten two great dogs from arl over the years the staff is polite and really cares about the animals and finding them the right home they get the animals the best vet care they can and i believe they have an on site clinic i would suggest even if they have a special on adoption prices pay the full amount if you can  from what i see they take great care of the animals and could use all the money they can to make sure this continues|i could never stop saying good things about the animal rescue league as other reviewers have pointed out going there both breaks and warms your heart  i adopted my puppy brock back in january and i couldnt be happier  the staff was super helpful and very kind they gave us enough time to make sure brock was the right dog for us and also made sure we knew what we were getting ourselves into brock is a husky mix so hes a ball full of energy great running buddy   i will most definitely be back and plan on telling all friends considering a pet to adopt from the arl|ventos is an east end tradition   the sicilian style pizza is the bomb   it is more of a traditional workingclass pittsburgh style crust  it comes square and bread like  think of men coming home from the steel mill with their thick crusty slices of square sauce  cheese pizza circa   if you prefer the doughy dominos or similar kind of pizza crust sickeningly sweet sauce papa johns or brick oven designer pizza you might not like ventos pizza  its a workingclass style of pizza in a workingclass neighborhood  personally i happen to love ventos pizzamy dad worked in steel mills all of his working days lol  they also have subs and other items like deep fried mushrooms  this is a blue collar  establishment in a an urban workingclass neighborhood  ventos is the real deal   everything ive had from here is hearty  good|i love love love my puppy  after visiting every shelter in the city and finding nothing we came back the next day after seeing a posting for a  month old terrier mix  our poor little guy had been dumped in a park and some very nice person brought him to the arl who took him in waited  days for someone to claim him and neutered him  he wasnt even supposed to be on the floor yet when we got there but they were super helpful and brought him out to us and let us take him home  the staff there were super helpful and wonderful to my incredibly anxious fiance imagine a first time dad bringing home the baby  the only reason they only get  stars is my poor puppy is so sick  weve had him for  weeks and hes got an awful cough that hasnt been responsive to any antibiotics  i know its hard to keep all the dogs isolated but i really think  weeks is a little too early to neuter a puppy especially after being found in a park too much stress  hopefully our little guy starts getting better soon were awfully worried about him  still love the arl though|the arl is great earlier in the month we mistakenly adopted  pit bulls after they killed my rabbit and got loose a few times we felt they were too much and gave them up the people who worked there were really understanding and asked us a lot of questions so as to provide the best care for them until they are hopefully adopted by the right people  sorry chloe and coco  they are a nokill shelter too always a huge plus|a few years ago i lost my partner and love of my life in a tragic accident  while struggling with my horrific grief and having difficulty getting back into life as i once knew it my grief counselor suggested that i help something else in order to help myself feel better  we decided that since i was an animal lover i would try volunteering at an animal shelter  i was not working so i had a lot of time and wanted the shelter to feel right  i visited a few they all do good work but the one that kept drawing me back was the arl  yes the building is old its a bit run down but that doesnt stop the staff and administration from doing the best they can with so very little and in not the best of space  i saw a bathroom be renovated into a vet tech office i saw the janitors closet renovated and made in to the rodent room  where cats once lived in cages along the halls of the arl a new building next door an old gas station was made into the cat adoption center  when you have staff that are still young and are going on  years  at the same shelter same place of employment for that matter you know something about the place is right  i volunteer easily  hours a week at the arl i get to see the good the bad and the ugly and i can tell you first hand that the good is in the staff the executive director dan rossi and all of the work that goes on for the animals  the staff knows every one of the animals they do all they can to care for them and keep the doors wide open for both domestic and wild animals even if that means a staff member or volunteer takes a cat or dog home  the answer is never ever no to any animal  i also volunteer for the humane society of the united states and travel around the countryside working on dogfighting raids cruelty hoarding natural disasters and the arl has never said no to me when i ask to bring animals back from incredibly sad or inhumane situations  technically by the numbers it is a nokill shelter because it is open door people will often call it a kill shelter  yes sometimes an animal does have to be euthanized  the arl is the animal control shelter for the city of pittsburgh and with that can bring some very upsetting and disturbing signs of animal cruelty  it can also mean its the dog who just bit a kid that you just saw on the news  the arl has an obligation to society to not let dangerous dogs back on the street to euthanize when a dog is very sick or is very aggressive to humans or other animals and trust me i have held many of those dogs as they are put to sleep and i always am so thankful that the vet staff we have are so compassionate and do the euthanasia in the most humane manner  thats a tough job its heartbreaking but in some cases it has to be done for the good of the animal and for the safety of society  i admire the work and staff of the arl and will continue to devote my time to them and thank them for the wonderful work they do on behalf of the city of pittsburgh and all of the wild and domestic animals alike  we are so lucky to have them in our area and as our city shelter|i adopted a dog from the arl this past spring  during the adoption process the employees were polite and seemed genuinely happy for me  shortly after the adoption i received emails from a volunteer to check in and to inquire about how the dog and i were adjusting  a few months after the adoption it became clear that the dog had some pretty serious anxiety and behavioral issues please note that there is no way the shelter staff could have known about the issues while the dog was in the shelter  i contacted the shelter and they practically  bent over backwards to help me with the dogs issues  the dog and i participated in two sessions of behavioral classes lacey is wonderful and never gave up on my dog consulted with veterinary staff and received constant emails from staff offering suggestions and checking in to see how i was doing  in the end i learned how to manage the dogs behaviors and i love the dog dearly  nine months later i still receive emails from the shelter asking about the dog and offering more suggestionsi would highy suggest adopting from this shelter  i understand that my dog is sort of a worsecasesenerio of adopting a preowned dog however this shelter will make sure you are happy with your adoption and literally will do everything in their power to ensure both you and the adopted animal are ok  the shetler staff care deeply about the animal and the humans wellbeing|ive had such good experiences with arl that i will probably return here again and again  years ago we adopted a mutt of a puppy that turned out to be the best dog that i could have ever imagined  but let me talk about my most recent visitwhile browsing facebook i noticed that they were having an event at arl  this particular event was called the free fur all  the event involved free adoption to qualified adopters free microchipping for any pet adopted there or elsewhere free dog baths and goodies for both human and furry companionsi had plans to get little man e microchipped during his appointment to take his manhood away dont worry weve talked about it and he is fine by it but when this popped up and said it was free  hot damn you know i was in line  its also probably one of the more easy and humane ways to keep ties on your dog or cat just in case they were to run off one nightonce we were registered we waited at most for  minutes  its a very quick thing to have done  little man e didnt even flinch  he was more amused by his reflection in the table than that little pinch behind the shoulder blade  i have to give huge kudos to the staff there  they are so very friendly to not only you but your pet  its like they talk their language  i also have to thank them because while we were there lme somehow ripped his one toenail and they were kind enough to clip as much of it off as they could no extra charge eitheronce done we just walked outside to see what was up e skipped the bath  we visited one of the tables and e selected a ball and bandanna and we decided to head out after thatthis place is amazing for so many different pet oriented things  ill definitely be coming back here whenever i need something for lme|this place is phenomenali got my bunny here a few months ago and the ladies were so nice and helpful and they take such good care of the animals  they gave me a bit of hay and food for her that lasted me close to three months  then when we were leaving we saw a cage of six dwarf hamsters and they gave us a deal of i love my animals so much and i will always check here first for pets before anywhere else|i adopted two cats from animal rescue league and my cats are healthy and happy they take care of animals with love and kindness they are of course so busy because there are many abandoned pets from irresponsible humansbut they made the whole adoption process easy and after almost a year my cats are still lovely and gives me so much love|i just adopted my second dog from this shelter i think theyre wonderful you must keep in mind that no rescue shelter is going to look like a  star hotel and be able to keep every animal free from illness but the arl does a great job all pets are spayedneutered vaccinated and receive a microchip your first vet visit after your adoption is halfoff their already cheap prices at their inhouse vet clinic they also give you a little goodie bag along with the pets vet records  im so thankful for the furry friends ive adopted from the arl|they are a pretty good place they do the best they can with the limited funding they have the employees definitely love the animals and want what is best for themwe adopted a cat from this location over a year ago and while it turned out okay we still have the cat i was surprised to learn from our vet that the cat we adopted was feralyoud think that would have been an important bit of information to share with the adopting family especially when theres a child in the house|everyone i have encountered here is amazing you can tell they are passionate and dedicated when it comes to their job i adopted a kitten here at the end of the summer and she is absolutely perfect you can tell that she was loved  cared for while in their care i took her for a  month check up recently and the vet was so nice he took time to look over her and was genuinely kind to me and my mom sometimes people who work with animals lose their people skills but this guy was great its waaaaay out of my way but id definitely take lily back there for any problems that arise well worth the drive|good work  he does very nice high quality work  a bit on the expensive side costs  to shorten two pairs of pants which i guess is reasonable considering that he does reliably high quality work  i havent given him anything more complex than that however so i dont know how hell take in your wedding dress but works for me|the animal rescue league is simply the friendliest most human and pet friendly shelter in the city i cannot thank them enough for allowing me to adopt my new little buddy i was able to meet and greet with the cat that i was looking to adopt and spend some time with him in a secluded play area his foster was there to ask some questions about what i was looking for in a cat and if i had any experience with cat care all pretty standard for what you should expect before rescuing a new family member the adoption process was super easy the paperwork was standard and nothing intrusive or out of the ordinary the adoption counselors were very thorough with the paperwork and answered any and all questions i had about my kittys health and history and allinall i was able to take him home the same day i filled out the paperwork this place is great and takes wonderful care of their animals i would highly recommend them be your first stop for adopting score out of five friendliness five starscustomer service five starsease of adoption process five starswould i ever recommend them absolutely|this place is great and even calls to double check when they find something they arent sure about i have had business suits altered here jackets etc my husband had a beloved winter coat that he wanted to have the pockets repaired and vincent or another man called back  minutes later freaking out very politely about how can i repair these pockets they are awful no pocket left shreds and we had a good laugh after telling him we meant for him to replace the pockets altogether he did a fabulous job and even though hes not cheap it is worth it to know you will get the clothes back in great shape|vincent has done several hems and jacket alterations on men suits for me items have always been one time and done well i would recommend this place to anyone searching for a tailor in pittsburgh it does seem a little expensive but worth it because its done correctly|it was  pm on friday and i was in a serious bind i needed new suit pants altered and my flight was leaving the next day at  am i called and vincent said he would help he got the job done with a smile and his work was perfection i would recommend vincent to anyone needing alterations great customer service|i had a great experience i needed to get a dress quickly tailored for an event i was flying out of town in two days and he was able to tailor the straps for me in time i picked up the dress two hours before my flight and it fit perfectly and its quite cheap i asked a different place for the same service and they asked for  more than topline i highly recommend this place|vincent provides the expert tailoring that is all but gone these days he is the best tailor in pittsburgh he takes his time and does it right i highly recommend topline because of the expertise of vincent and his wife and the quality of their work|we recently lost our beloved cat and our hearts are still broken i couldnt stand our house without a cat so i begged my husband to go look at kittens we knew we wanted a shelter cat so we went to the arl it was a wonderful experience the volunteers were very helpful we were holding kittens in the kitten room but the one we seemed to really like was very nervous they allowed us to take her into another room and checked on us numerous timesthey were extremely busy and shortstaffed but efforts were still made to make sure we were able to bond with the kitten they werent pushy and they were very patientonce we made our decision to adopt they whisked us over to the main building the whole process took about  minutes the staff really cares about the well being of their animals its great place|the rite aid on baum used to be my pharmacy but i flipped to this cvs location because of the convenience on the route tofrom work   at first my experience was not unlike the other recent reviews  i too hate having to ask the clerks to open the locked compartments that hold the razor blades etc  butthe pharmacy staff is terrific  i have never had friendlier more knowledgable and more responsive pharmacy staff at any other drug store   the service is firstrate and the extra care and attention to detail is deeply appreciated|very easy place to get my tires replaced  i pulled in they took a few pieces of information and i just had to wait  while i was to wait i made sure it was ok for me to walk to nearby businesses to pick up a few items i needed  they took my phone number and told me they would call when my car was finishedwhile i was out at nearby stores my phone rang less than a hour later and was told i could come and pick up my car  walked in paid and away i wentwhy couldnt i give this place a five star rating  two reasons    i ordered my tires and was expecting to receive a call on a friday to stop in and have the tires put on my car they did not call me at all and i called the following monday to find out my tires were there for the past few days and no one made the effort to call me   when i left i could not comprehend why the air pressure wasnt regulated to my new tires  how hard was it to make sure that my psi was set to   one tire was at  and the other at   i promptly needed to visit a gas station to remedy the situation|great work and excellent customer service with our extended training in dc weve been out of town a lot and so only had july th weekend to do the emissions test and state inspection on our car i called for an appointment dropped the car off by am saturday july th and it was ready by noon thanks to kayla craig and the entire team at good year for fitting us in i really appreciated them getting this done for us so quickly not to mention the fact that they worked a full day on a national holiday|i have bought tires here i have gotten tires repaired here the staff is prompt the product is good|rocco and vivian have truly been a graceful pair to my roommate and i for the past year we lived right on fifth avenue and bellefonte and found no reason to complain aside from the neighbors dog downstairs the few mishaps that happened within the apt  a broken lock a leaking sink were fixed within  hours of calling our landlord rocco i have to say that for two girls who forget the little things more of ten than not we could not have asked for more understanding tenants for the amount of times we were locked out forgot keys needed a drawer fixed needed heat etc our space was clean and everyone in the building was friendly and respectful i highly recommend to any student looking for housing in the burgh|while looking for a rental after relocating rockwel was extremely helpful and courteous  they were very responsive and accommodating with the right deadline my wife and i were under  they were willing to go above and beyond to get the place prepped in time couldnt recommend them more|we have been living in our apartment with this company for more than  years  really love it this is an old building about  years old it has great character  a lot of quirks thats what we like about it the building is well maintained but one can expect things to go wrong in any home this old the folks at rockwel realty are extremely responsible  responsive to our calls most things are resolved within a day  real emergencies are responded to immediately for example weve had a broken water heater that was replaced the same day last winter when the weather was below zero for several days in a row  we had a broken water pipe the landlord was over in  minutes a plumber was over within an hour the landlords keep the property clean landscaped and in working order and are pleasant trustworthy and dependable|this place is nestled in a nice location next to the city water reservoir and highland park making it a great place to grab a coffee if you are out for a morning walk it offers a clean and casual interior and draws a more eclectic crowd than most cafes leans a bit towards the business casual crowd still ha that neighborhood feel though i have never had food there though they offer paninis great desserts good espressos and okay coffeeoutdoor seating good place to study plenty of laptop outlets and free wireless|on my recent road trip from dallas to new haven ct randy s and i stopped in pittsburgh to revel in its charms this i must add was in opposition to his mothers strong protests to the effect of theres nothing in pittsburgh why would anyone go there tazza doro is the answer to that question especially if you like coffee this is easily one of the best coffee shops east of the mississippi and ive been to a lot of them so whats so good about itlets go in order of importancecoffee  it is really really good they use batdorf and bronson beans where an exgf of mine used to work in olympia believe me when i tell you that bb is good its not amazingly great but its very solid and they take roasting seriously when i go to a new coffee place i suspect might be good i always get a latte why this one has a high upside if done well and the lowest downside lots of milk if done poorly i got a latte they have a few sizes oz was the first one i got it was fantastic they did a nice little rosetta in it too look up latte art on google if you have no idea what this is the baristo really knew what he was doing and pulled a some good shots with excellent crema the coffee was so good coffee is supposed to taste bold smooth and rich which it almost never does and this place had it down i had to go back for an oz which is another level of trust it has the same amount of coffee but less milk to hide poor coffee quality it was always superior this is a coffee place that is truly top notch based on the coffee alone but there was more pastries  they all looked amazing i had a plain donut while i waited in line normally i dont eat plain donuts because life is too short for plain donuts but it was really very good everyone was commenting on how nice the pastries wereatmosphere  this place has it exactly right its a mom  pop feel nothing forced some tables outdoor seating maybe some local art but not in a goofy sort of way very friendly employees just a complete home run obviously i loved it behind me in line for my reup i heard a girl behind me in line complain we could just go to starbucks its cheaper then proceeded to order with sugar free syrups and skim milk thats fine everyone has to do what they like and with the proliferation of bad coffee starbucks only being guilty of mediocre though a little bit interesting coffee over the past  years i dont blame people for being set that way but the beautiful thing about tazza doro cup of gold in italian is thatif you let itit will remind you that you dont need to make your coffee up like a drag queen on halloweentazza doro stands as a reminder that coffee can be enjoyed in all its naked glory in an awesome setting on a beautiful street and give you a good fing reason to go to pittsburgh|although i am not a coffee drinker i do love their iced mochas  they have wonderful teas cider hot chocolate  the servers are wonderful and the brownies as big as your head are like crack  amy the owner has created a wonderful place for community|do you see how all of the other reviews give this place  stars  this place is way more than a  star coffee shop  i am giving all  stars to this delightful coffee shop because it is the perfect community coffee shop  i am slightly saddened that they took out the  overstuffed chairs but they need more tables because people like to come here and people hanging out in their community is a good thing  it is  on a monday morning and the place is almost full  there are always people coming going getting coffeeit is a great place to sit and read the paper or to pick up some coffee on your way to some place elseenricos also has become a hub for other community activities  there a a couple of weekly bike groups that meet hereother reasons to love this place i know some of the other reviews highlighted these but i thought they were worth repeating free wifi outside tables tasty treats they have a blog really great coffee the staff are coffee experts|this is one of my two favorite coffeehouses in town it took me far too long to come around and love tazza doro a horrible ex of mine loved this place and i admit that this soured me i regret the time i wasted not going here the dark wood inside comforts me the small tables outside are a great place to spend the summer tazza doro brews batdorf and bronson beans amazing provides enrico pastries amazing free wireless amazing and one of the most talented and friendly staffs ive ever met amazing everyone who works there is so nice and so good at what they do they have a small menu of localfresh food that looks amazing but i have never actually eaten it the espresso served here is actually better than the average shot served at batdorf and bronson locations in olympia wa i talked about this with one of the barristas at tdo and they were offended  we calibrate our machines the same we use the same beans the exact same blends and milks and everything it cant be different sorry tazza doro you are better the lines get long on weekend mornings but they move quickly theres a sense of community nestled here just off the main drag of highland park between bryant st and the reservoir this is where you can pick up your csa shipment for the week where multiple weekly bike rides originate where there are lively discussion groups meeting nearly every day the percentage of students is low like the rest of pittsburgh theres a good chance youll run into someone you know but generally i see people i like and miss which is different than the norm in pittsburgh for me|tazza doro has a generally european decor with dark rich colors and textures and a cozy layout that makes the most of the space the espresso is bar none the best ive had  including my admittedly limited travels in italy its stellar espresso  rich thick potent without being sour or bitter with unique nuances that vary slightly depending on the shot and the weather but are always fantasticthe coffee is also terrific and tazza doro uses batdorf  bronson beans  the best ive ever had for home grinding they have a good selection of pastries and cookies as well as a broad selection of tasty sandwiches that come with a satisfying side saladin addition they have a wonderful selection of teas im no expert and dont know their supplier but the halfdozen different blends ive tried were all memorably flavorfulall that and its a lovely center of community where you can bring your laptop or a book or a friend and spend the day no one is rushed out the door and there almost always seems to be a little room for your studies or conversation|i love this place the best coffee in the burgh good atmosphere great service the food is really good too|best independent coffeeshop ive ever had the pleasure to visitbest americano ive ever had  some of the best espresso ive ever had  great desserts pastries and cookies  good food  the employees are awesomethe owner apparently put the shop there because their neighborhood didnt previously have anything like it  the shop is also all about bicycling as transportation sponsoring regular group rides around town and also group walks for those not bicycleinclined|some of the best coffee ive ever had  everstick with an italian cappuccino and bring a good friend for some good conversation|quick service amazing coffee nice vibe|i love this place its warm and cozy ambiance and the coffee and baked goods are wonderful  the staff is so inviting too|this is some of the best coffee ive ever had ive been looking for a local coffee shop that made good coffee and didnt have irritating quirks in their service ive run into a cashonly lame hours shop and a wedonthaveanespressomachine shop which are useless to methe pastry i had was good though a bit overpriced at  the mocha i had was absolutely amazing though their largest size is only  oz which is an adjustment if youre expecting the larger sizes some other coffee shops produce|the coffee here was excellent had a double espresso apparently their roaster is in santa cruz ca large selection of french press coffees baked goods did not look too great but that is not why i came here atmosphere is very mellow and comfortable also has wifi which works nice to find a place like this when traveling is in the middle of a residential area and there doesnt seem to be anything else around here|i love tazza doro great coffee excellent baked goods and the food is delicious|they just opened a spot at carnegie mellon on campus in the gates building and it has changed my life my closest coffee option before was seattles best so you can imagine how delighted i was when this opened next door to where i have class all day  the first week they were open i think i went there about  times  the italian cappuccino will wire you for a few hours but is totally amazing  their basic coffee pales in comparison to their espressos though so stick with espresso drinks i have also had two delicious paninis which i highly recommend  knowledgeable service great drinks yum|this cafes espresso drinks are on par with the best artisinal coffee houses anywhere  i always go out of my way to get coffee from here when im in pittsburgh|i love tazza their coffees are excellent and its a great place to enjoy a relaxing eveningi also like their baklawa sandwiches and brownies|coffee coffee espresso cappuccino coffee espressotea  amazing selection of teas highquality loose and those that ive tried have been so delicately balanced the word perfect comes to mind while their espresso is also excellent ive not been pleased by tazza doros soy lattes so i am going to indulge my renewed enthusiasm for fine teas and work my way through their extensive menu that which is not to be overlooked if you have even the slightest interest in exploring beyond the weak frontiers of lipton|best coffee in pittsburgh without a doubt believe the hype ive been going here for years and every visit is a pleasure|yes awesome soy cap scone and atmosphere nice place to hang out  read and free wifi with no login procedure|this is a staple neighborhood coffee house right down the hill from the park great outdoor seating very hip atmosphere plenty of plugs for laptops comfy chairs for relaxing friendly people only problem is finding a seat|one of the best cups of coffee in pgh  great atmosphere for working studying or a meeting  very neighborly feeling|thought its somewhat pointless to write a review for this place i mean every spro geeks i know of in town knows this is the best place to get a cup doppio or any espresso drink the only reason i still decided to write this review is stupid yelp doesnt let me add a store to my list unless i have written a review for it dahthis place is where all my fine coffee addiction started with never did i have a cup of starbucks coffee after my first visit to tazza dro not sure if it is a good thing since now i have to do a lot of research on where to get a good cup of coffee before going to a new city no matter for business or for pleasurei love their signature bike love for all the espresso drink w milk its fruity mild and fragrant its addictive the only thing i have against it is that it has pretty strong caffeine in it although it tastes super innocent its actually almost stronger then any spro blend ive triedi also appreciate a lot  the community atmosphere and the effort to bring in community improvement of tdnot a good place to studywork at on a weekend afternoon tho its too popular thus noisy|i would never have found this place if it wasnt for yelp  it is somewhat hidden among lots of houses and residential buildings  i ordered a latte and blueberry scone both were great  i wanted to order food but i was told that they do not serve food even breakfast until  am  i would go back if i am in the area|some of the best coffee in pittsburgh and many argue that it is in fact the best really warm rich blends especially the espresso the tea menu is extensive and has a lot of variety so its a great place for noncoffeedrinkers too it has a relaxed atmosphere with indoor and outdoor seating is there anything cosier than curling up in one of the window seats with a booknotebook on a rainy day ive done it all here from writing and filing an article when the newsroom was too loud to meeting a blind date its a good place to linger and savor its proximity to the park is a big advantage|just realized that no one mentioned about their chai latte yet they make their chai from scratch the best chai i have ever had outside of my indian coworkers kitchen the only thing is since they premade a whole pot theres no way you can get a cup of skim chai|local friendly businesses serving a great product do still exist|best coffee i had in pittsburgh their italian cappuccino is pretty addictive|the epitome of  stars excellent without being perfect tucked away in the middle of a charming old residential neighbourhood youll likely miss it the first drive by turning around is worth ityes the staff tends to be the typical hipster bikeriding sort that so commonly seems to staff indie coffee shops but theyre friendly and unpretentious so dont hold it against them  the patrons are almost exclusively college students anyone else tends to drive by and take their coffee to go though hipsters are actually in the minority here  anyone under the age of  will fit in perfectly and no one  and under will feel uncomfortable  the noise level is perfect  most students are on their laptops with headphones a few are chatting quietly and the background indie music is just that  you dont need headphones to concentrate heredecor is decent without being great  the ceiling is crossed by beautiful wooden beams and the floor is a pleasantly bland creamy ceramic tile  so is the wallpaper though the original modern paintings tend to help make things interesting  where it loses points is in the furnishings the mixture of wall lamps hanging fixtures and pot lights doesnt work well the serving bar itself is an ugly cheap laminate and the touches of plastic greenery dribbled around the place fails misserablyiced water is provided which is decent plastic cups are a minus but inferior to the mineral water other places serve we tried their richly brewed ethiopian to rave reviews with the party split on whether the thick ceramic mug was a plus hefty and warming or minus hard to drink from truly fantastic coffee but the lattes were rather disappointing beautifully steamed milk in every cup but a rather bland espresso shot left the latte rather lacking in the nuanced flavour one finds in a  star establishment  the medium latte oz with  shots of espresso  the steongest ratio they offer should have been far betterthe food looked worth having but wed just eaten homemade pastries and fresh sandwiches looked tempting and we certainly will come hungrier next timea solid four stars held back a bit by decor and a lot by espresso|the coffee here is amazing i love when the baristas take the effort to make patterns in the foam the baristas were extremely friendly and the pastries looked delicious while there are a number of tables enricos was busy even on a friday nighti would imagine that it would be hard to find a table during peak hours|one of the best espresso bars ive been to for great espresso  i had a shot of ethiopian espresso  fantastic  grabbed a costa rican pourover on my way out  perhaps one of the best cups of coffee ive ever had for baristas who pay great attention to detail for great atmosphere  the ceiling is tastefully ornate and the decor is pleasing  hearty wood furniture used throughout for having a location a bit far from downtowna favorite for locals and notsolocals alikehighly recommended  i will return|the environment is just what you would hope for in a coffee shop tastefully decorated with some local art in an old building with a cool ceiling and floor a great place to enjoy a beverage book and musici had an italian cappuccino it was well balanced and i enjoyed every sip on my way out i had a costa rican pour over that took me by surprise it was incredibly smooth with a complex flavor it rolled off my tongue without the thin taste of a poorly roasted bean as the drink cooled the flavor profile changed but continued to pleasei highly recommend this shop if you are looking for a place to spend a few hours and enjoy everything from speaking with competent baristas to the last sip of your drink i will be returning|i tell everyone about this highland park gem my friend introduced me to people who come here appreciate expertly steamed milk and delicious breakfastlunch options in this quaint shop gone are the days of the massproduced lattes and microwaved sandwiches every time i visit pittsburgh i make sure this place is in my schedule somewhere love it|pittsburghs definitely got nothing on seattle when it comes to a good brew but if you look hard enough youll find a few diamonds in the rough tazza doro is one of them i wont say the best simply because coffee is such an objective taste but you cannot deny the expertise and care tazza doro subscribes to it brings them millions of miles above starbucks and gasp crazy mochai found out about tazza doro while browsing the blog of an award winning internationally recognized barista he conveniently mapped out his favorite coffee houses around the us via google maps i clicked on pa and zoomed it not even expecting to see a marker surprisingly there was  only one  and it was for tazza dorotheir baristas know how to make the perfect espresso once youve done that all of your other drinks fall right into place they also do french pressed coffee which is a rare treat usually enjoyed at home and at least in my case not done nearly as well as it should be their pastries and baked goods come straight from one of the burghs best bakeries  enricos in the strip district what more could you ask fori have a longer article on tazza doro as well as another great coffee shop espresso a mano on my website httpeatinginpittsburghcomcoffeepittsburghpart|good coffee the atmosphere is nice it was good to get out of the cold when we took our walk the coffee was good and not too expensive|i can remember the time when i used to strictly drink mocha frappuccinos from starbucks thinking that it was the be all end all to coffee in my younger teens dont we all miss those days of being so naive admittedly i never finish any coffee that i drink not only because im apparently wasteful now that i think about it but also because im a slow sipper and everything settles at the very end make no mistakes i will finish any coffee drink from tazza doro and at record speed it is delicious to the very last drop and the best part is they dont think that third degree burns go hand in hand with their coffee  its ready for drinking the moment you receive your order lets not forget about the food which is also delicious its clear i have nothing bad to say about this establishmentsome of the staff remembers your order to a tee and all of them are always very courteous the prices are reasonable and the location is great tucked away in highland park|this is where i learned what good espresso tastes like if you make it to highland park stop there and get some great neighborhood atmosphere|outstanding lattes period the service can be very slow but the latte is worth the wait and the staff does not seem to care to chat with customers but they make darn good lattes so who carestucked in the beautiful highland park neighborhood among many historic houses and close to the handful bryant street restaurants tazza doro is a fantastic place for coffee lovers like me a nice short walk from highland park is a welcome plus get the latte take a stroll down the street to explore the houses and take a walk in the park that is a beautiful and coffeeful sunny summer afternoon for you they also have food but i cannot speak for that the interior is somewhat run down at places but that gives it character|one of my favorite coffee places in pittsburgh they also have pretty good sandwiches and salads if you are looking for some light lunch food otherwise they have plenty of pasteriescookies to eat that are pretty good|maybe tazza doro doesnt need another review but i guess it never hurts to lend your voice to the chorus of those praising a good solid and wellrun local business  the coffee selection is terrific  the baristas are professional and courteous  no they are not chatty but they are polite and friendly  im not there for conversation but for good coffee  and thats what you get  the pastries and snacks are fine  good variety  the atmosphere is just what i want when i need a cup of coffee relatively quiet comfortable and calming  when it first opened how long ago how it was mobbed by some of my neighbors i live in highland park who adopted it as their private club and often seemed peeved at others who stopped by   theyve either relaxed or found other obsessions  the clientele is as folks said eclectic and invigorating  its become our afterdinner spot after a meal at park bruges or smiling banana leaf too|finally a great neighborhood coffee shop that just so happens to brew fantastic coffee the espresso is incredible which makes for an excellent cappuccino and the food is pretty good too croissants muffins and other baked goods top the breakfast list while madetoorder paninis and delicious homemade soups round out the lunch menuthe crowd at enricos is varied which i really enjoy my yearold neighbor and his crew of retired friends pull up a chair every day at  pm next to business folks college students techies and other folks who are looking for a good brewno frills no extras just nice people in a quaint coffee shop brewing up warm goodness|hands down the best cappuccino youll get in pittsburgh i have yet to be disappointed consistency in quality in a coffee joint is what im looking for oh and alright those delectable treats they always have dont hurt either apple dumpling|as if in answer to my prayerim not basing this review on the quality of the coffee i had rooibos tea and a delicious apple galette im basing this on the fact that i love this style of coffee shop could be in seattle or portland and the fact that since coming to pburgh for a few days for the first time its the first aggregation of nongrumpy people ive been around well to be fair all the partying college students on the south side last night were not grumpy maybe its that the folks sitting around me here at tozza doro are just chilling quietly dong whatever they are doing and not being overly grumpy or self absorbed they dont apear to have more than coffee and pastries but they do have free wirelessthere is not as much in this neighborhood as i thought there was going to be but if you find yourself here and you like noncorporate home grown cafes this is a great place to chill|what a cute little coffee shop in such an idealistic setting  i sat amongst the gathered hipsters moms friends ladies who lunch power business lunch people in a sunny little corner of the room sipping my delicious indian spice black teaservice was very friendly and looking at the fresh pastries and lunch list of homemade soups and sandwiches made me want to come back and enjoy a leisurely afternoon or perhaps work day here taking in all they have to offer  i was surprised when i asked to see the tea list and the barista told me they didnt have much to offer  still looked like a good amount to me and i was pleased to see a variety of different offerings some coffee shops dont offer because well theyre usually coffee focused  i also enjoy that they use loose leaf tea so you know its not just coming straight outta a generic box of twinings  free internet is always a big plus with lots of outlets  now if someone could just find me an affordable house in highland park this could just be my next favorite neighborhood coffee shop|great atmosphere often crowded not too expensive tasty beverages both my husband and i had mochas delicious|wonderful lovely quaint one of the most refreshing cafes in pittsburgh my visit was a surprise from my boyfriend who knows how much i appreciate fine espresso i was instantly enamored with the setup inside and the pleasant nature of the individuals who greeted us behind the counter the baked goods were absolutely fabulous and we literally would have bought one of everything if we hadnt come to our senses i ordered a grande cafe mocha and it came with a wonderful rim of whipped cream i believe the whipped cream was homemade as well simply to die for and a subtle addition of foam art which just shows how considerate the baristas are of their craft my boyfriend ordered the italian cappuccino and said it tasted just like the drinks he would get in italy over his  week visit with family this past summer now if that isnt representative of a solid job in bringing a european cafe to the states then i dont know what is|their mochas are amazing|great variety of coffee and methods press chemex pourover  i did not get a chance to try to the espresso but it looked very good as well verve and olympia are two very solid roasters and provide a wealth of choices staff was very helpful location great all around a good place in pittsburgh|best coffee ultimate staff neighborhood gem|it was a bit out of the way of where we were staying but i was swayed by the yelp reviews  you did not steer me wrong a nice little coffee joint in a quiet neighborhood enricos was the perfect spot to get my caffeine fix before starting the day at full speed  my wife and i both got lattes and pastries and everything was good to goit looked like we were the only patrons that didnt plan on spending the whole day there rooted to a chair  we got the next to last free table  almost every twotop had only one person sitting at it  i would imagine its tough to find a seat sometimes recommendps i thought it was interesting that you can also purchase bike tire tubes here|great authentic coffee at a reasonable price the pastries are really tasty as well but pricier it is a great atmosphere to catch up with a friend or just relax with a cup of coffee the staff is also very friendly|i really was missing voluto before its new ownership  management took over on penn ave  i needed a new place to try with friends who live in highland park for an excellent cup of fancy joe im a steamed milk kind of galstarbucks bless them when i am in a rush but i have to order a tripple just to get a hint of my fix but the coffee here is the right strength to cover my caffeine withdrawals lovely atmosphere small but not tiny outdoor seating if you want it their espresso shots are not served in steamed cupstake note if youre a hardcore ezzzspresso shooter and you like it piping hot i am sure if you asked they could probably warm the cup the baristas are so friendly and laid back and funny also the staff members let me use the bathroom after closing one time perfect gentlemen  a decent selection of yummy pastries to compliment your coffee awaits from apple turnovers to decadent browniesi also like the crowd that comes here there are younger people older peopler and everyone inbetween the  somethings and  somethings my age group it has a neighborhood feel but i can tell people come from surrounding areas tazza is a great example of merging the old and new in pittsburgh while maintaining the character of its home borough|cute little spot in a sweet neighborhood snag a table before ordering and youll have a great experience i stopped in for a cappuccino and sandwich the cappuccino was hot and satisfying good quality beans strong and the vegetable panini adequate im not the biggest fan of artichoke leavesgood spot for reading a book and eavesdropping on strangers conversations|what a great find i frequent the nearby bryant street restaurants but did not even know this place existed until a friend of mine brought took me here today for hot chocolate i immediately fell in love it the baristas were very friendly and my hot chocolate was great there were also some incredibly deliciouslooking pastries which i will need to go back soon to try there was a nice ambience  it was quiet but not uncomfortable so it would be a great place to study read or visit with friendsyou should expect to wait a few minutes for your drink but it is well worth it |i had always meant to visit enricos and since my friend recently moved to the neighborhood it was a perfect opportunity to cross it off my listso heres what i liked the cappuccino was perfect its an awesome cappuccino topped with a cute foam art leafheres what i didnt like sometimes i take my cappuccino plain sometimes i take it with a shot of syrup on this occassion i asked if i could get amaretto syrup which they had but the barista responded no you cant he said they only make their cappuccino plain and if i liked sweet he could make me something special but i would have to trust his taste heres the thingi dont like sweet i dont have much of a sweet tooth i just wanted a tiny bit of sweet so i didnt think trusting his mystery concoction was a good idea i just got it plainim not a big fan of coffee shop snobbery nor the fact that this guy seemed to have sterotyped me as a starbucksguzzling yuppie who had to be shown what a real cappuccino tasted like please i lived in italy ive had a real cappuccinobut right now i want a flavor shot in it i still tipped because i wasnt sure if it was the barista or just a general rule at this place and he did offer to make me something different i just dont get what the deal is herewhy do they even bother having flavor syrups if youre not allowed to add them to your drink its a star cappuccino for sure but i had to subtract a star for the attitude|best coffee in pittsburghyou might think there is better coffee elsewhere  youre wrongi love this coffee shop and there is a second location the gates building at cmu that i like to go totheir panini are to die fori love this place and you will too|best coffee it pittsburgh maybe but this place is certainly competitive french press drip espresso or pour over you name it theyve got it only downside of this place is a limited food and pastry selection if it is just coffee you want you this is the place it is it a bit snobbish sure but not nearly as much as many of the other coffee shops in pittsburgh|everything i want in a bistro  the sandwiches are delicious the service is wonderful  love that pastry guy  ambiance is great  the only thing is its a little crowded because everyone loves this place|
