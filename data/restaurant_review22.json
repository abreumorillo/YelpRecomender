Their is absolutely nothing wrong with this place but the problem is it is not a place that will stick out from the crowd. It's kind of lost in the crowd. Pittsburgh is a city full of bars this one is relaxed. It's a great neighborhood bar. And I would come back but it is not a wow that is a great place.  It's just good enough", "businessName": "Alexion's Bar & Grill"}
