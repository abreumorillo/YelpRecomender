Long John Silver's|Carnegie|PA
i love ljs and have to agree, service was decent here. i tried a piece of my kid's chicken (i only ever get the fish for myself) and was pleasantly surprised to find white breast meat (same chicken texture as chick fil a). a little grimy dining room, and the bathroom handle is broken 8/2015... it would be nice if they made it an a&w-ljs but as-is still works for me.
