i agree with paul on this one. but i had to stop here on my way home from work tonight. 
(i think i feel my heart yelling at me again) , the gal at the drive thru window was just soooo sweet , i just might go back and ask her to marry me! 
but then again , she gave me a slip with a survey on it to fill out online. 
maybe she just wanted my positive response. ok sarah b. you got it ... now where's my free coke ?
