There wasn't much enthusiasm about the location but the reluctantly agreed.  We stopped in front and my wife said we aren't going in there are we? Well once the order the food and enjoyed the best Reuben,  fish sandwich and stuffed peppers they were sold. The owner came over and thanked us for stopping. She is a real asset to the place. The restrooms were spotless, which important to my wife. I have taken places where she had to hover  over the commode. I went back two days later for the hulushki. A real gem a perfect place to eat real comfort food. Don't forget the liver and onions.", "businessName": "Emil's Lounge"}
