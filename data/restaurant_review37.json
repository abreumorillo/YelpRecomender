{"businessState": "PA", "businessCity": "rankin", "content": "From reading the other reviews, I see this place was on some top 25 places in Pittsburgh list a few years ago.  I haven't seen it myself, but have known of this place for a while before my first visit in 2013.  It wasn't until my almost 80yo buddy, Mr. Italo Donatucci (world's coolest old Italian dude) brought me one of the best fish sandwiches I ever had that I became hooked!  I've had at least 10 since then, but only during the Lent season.  I gave my 5 rating based on the fish sandwich alone.  Try it without a bun also!  Either way you get 3 nice size pieces of fish equal to a pound.  You can have your choice of sides, but I always get the small mac n cheese for my side.  The staff is always really friendly and service is prompt.  It's in a rough neighborhood, but the Rankin police station is right across the street.  Almost every visit there I have seen police officers inside mingling with the locals or picking up lunch orders.  Soon I plan to make a visit that's not a Friday during Lent to try other menu items.", "businessName": "Emil's Lounge"}
