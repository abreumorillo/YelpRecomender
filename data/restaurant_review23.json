Great wings and the buffalo chicken pizza is the best I've had. The sandwiches are all on thick cut Italian bread and fresh. Definitely  a hidden gem of the Greetree/Carnegie area. Looking for a low key hole in the wall with good prices and great food this is your place.", "businessName": "Alexion's Bar & Grill"}
