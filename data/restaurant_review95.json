It was chaotic and no one alerted us to whether we should seat ourselves or wait to be seated, and when we tried to ask a woman working behind the counter, she gave us a dirty look like we weren't welcome there. Eventually we just sat down and someone came by to take our order. The server was nice enough, but wasn't very quick with the coffee refills - I finished my first cup slowly and then it sat empty for about five minutes. Food was ok, but not amazing. We got the mixed grill and a pancake, and both were solid but not outstanding. \nNot a bad place to go, but we probably won't go out of our way to go here again, either.", "businessName": "Gab & Eat"}
