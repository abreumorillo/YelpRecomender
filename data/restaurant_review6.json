I tried a piece of my kid's chicken (I only ever get the fish for myself) and was pleasantly surprised to find white breast meat (same chicken texture as chick fil a). A little grimy dining room, and the bathroom handle is broken 8/2015... It would be nice if they made it an A&W-LJS but as-is still works for me.", "businessName": "Long John Silver's"}
