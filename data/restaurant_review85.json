I had the western omlet and will be getting it or another omlet again soon\n\nThe coffee was good, totally serviceable diner coffee. The waitress was wonderfully friendly and hopping around from table to table. The food was excellent. The ambience was exactly right for a diner. It was packed. The wait was not nearly as long as I was expecting. 10 minutes maybe.\n\nTotally recommended. Come hungry.", "businessName": "Gab & Eat"}
