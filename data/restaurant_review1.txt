Mr Hoagie|Dravosburg|PA
mr hoagie is an institution. walking in, it does seem like a throwback to 30 years ago, old fashioned menu board, booths out of the 70s, and a large selection of food. their speciality is the italian hoagie, and it is voted the best in the area year after year. i usually order the burger, while the patties are obviously cooked from frozen, all of the other ingredients are very fresh. overall, its a good alternative to subway, which is down the road.
