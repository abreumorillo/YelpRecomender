New Dragon Chinese Restaurant|Delmont|PA
perhaps it was an off night, but we were really disappointed in our take-out. my husband's pork fried rice was not fried rice...still don't know what it was. his gen. tso's chicken was flat and my cashew chicken was flavorless. in the past it has been good food.
