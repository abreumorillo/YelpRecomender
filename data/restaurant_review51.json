I have never been to a Kings Family Restaurant since moving to Pittsburgh.   There are several local establishments.\n\nThis particular location has pretty good food at a great price.   It is similar to a Cracker Barrel and / or Bob Evans.   I ordered something very hearty - Country Fried Steak , Eggs, and Cheesy Potatoes.\n\nThe food and coffee were good.    The service was excellent. \n\nI will go back.  \n\nBreakfast runs from $5-8.   \n\nMy breakfast cost me just over $10 - very comparable to Cracker Barrel / Bob Evans.", "businessName": "Kings Family Restaurant"}
