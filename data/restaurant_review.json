The crust, sauce, and cheese illustrate unique qualities of Pittsburgh pizza.  Crust tends to be thin like New York pizza, but chewy rather than crunchy.  Pizzerias often use a blend of provolone and mozzarella or straight provolone, and if it's a pizzeria worth anything, the cheese will snap when melted (think of how stringy the cheese gets on cheap delivery pizza).  Pittsburgh pizza sauce will taste distinctly of red wine and not oregano (thank God).   Beto's parbakes the pizza and then finishes it for a few minutes before topping it with the cold cheese (by the way, they'll melt it if you tell them).   If you like provolone and want perfect Beto's, get six squares to go, and leave them in the box about 10 minutes.   Last time I flew into Pgh, my mom sent me to Beto's before I even got to her house.

You will NOT get a dining experience, so for those of you who want to go to a nice japanese restaurant for dinner, you are not in luck. This sushi stand is only open for lunch, and typically closes at about 4pm on a weekday. You could be waiting about 15-30 minutes depending on the time/day you go because there is just one guy who makes the orders. He's fast, but his line can get long. \n\nTake it for what it is: Andy uses fresh and tasty fish. He cuts you big pieces for both his a la carte pieces and his rolls. He will make you any custom order you'd like provided he has the ingredients. He does have a limited selection of Sushi/Sashimi platters. He has a good spider roll and after going a few times, definitely ask for the \"Chef's Special\" -- he just loads up a roll for you.

The billboards of the giant super 3-lb. burrito finally cast a spell on me, and I took the plunge.\n\nLa Tolteca is not quite as full service as Ranch Market, but it's somewhat of a smaller version where you'll find a counter-service deli, panaderia, carniceria, jugeria, and a mini-market here.

What a steal.  \n\nUpon entrance you'll see the deep pit outside where some man is grilling all the carne you'll find served inside.

It's very authentic, cooked by commadres and tias just like back home.   The Grandma quotient on the beans and rice was very high -- always a standard assessment in my quest for good Mexican food.  They have every imaginable burrito type here and they're huge and cheap - at $4.  I always opt for the veggie (rice, beans, cheese and guacamole) burrito and am always impressed - the best part being the freshly made tortillas.  I even bought some on my way out to take home.\n\nThe tacos are a good choice too.  The combo plates start at $5.  The carne asada (a little overcooked) was pretty good and delicious in a flavorful marinade, and the shrimp taco was really good - a much better choice I would add.  Paired with some tamarind, strawberry agua fresca or horchata and you'll be in heaven.\n\nI find the bakery to be the highlight regarding the food.  The pandulce was excellent - if a bit more fresh (than Ranch Market) given the way it's stored behind a glass case rather than self-service.

Guanaquito had a far greater variety of pupusas than Elaina's, and they were every bit as good. The one that I had that was most unique was made with cheese and loroco plant (which to me had an asparagus-y taste). Definitely delicious. At both Salvadoran places, we were served a bowl of cabbage salad, but at Eliana's we had never been told how to eat it. Guanaquito's was far less astringent and we were instructed to eat it with our pupusas. I was skeptical at first, but became quickly hooked. It did not overwhelm the taste of the pupusas, and added a nice crunch and zing. \n\nThe only thing I found that Eliana's did better than Guanaquito was the flan.

Pizza Heaven is another one of those hole-in-the-wall eateries that you hear about via word-of-mouth. Oh sure, I can sit here and spout out multi-hyphenated phrases all day, but in the end, Pizza Heaven is a great little place to get a slice or two.\n\nYou can do just that. Their menu offers pizza by the slice. Or if you're in a mood to share, you can order a whole conventional pie. Each slice is individually baked, so you should allay those fears of eating something that's been sitting under a heat lamp for who-knows-how-long. They come out of the oven piping hot and delicious. The ongoing daily special is Two Cheese Slices and a fountain drink for $4.00. Toppings are 50 cents extra, per slice, which is still not a bad deal if you want to add pepperoni and still not break the bank.\n\nI first heard about Pizza Heaven when some of my coworkers, during their several-times-a-week (I'm trying to stop with the hyphenates, honestly) ritual of ordering take out, started to pass a menu around. Now, I may not be accustomed to traditional Italian calzones, but something that caught me off guard was the fact that the calzone came with ricotta cheese as opposed to mozzarella. On recent visits, I've specified mozzarella be used rather than their default of ricotta. Other items ordered by my colleagues included Angel Bread Sticks, Meatball Parmigiana Stuffed Sandwich and the Insalata Caprese. There wasn't one item that they delivered that didn't look good. The menu also offers a whole wheat crust option and you can order your pizza with soy cheese if you feel the need. Other items on the menu I have yet to try include various pasta dishes, chicken wings (your choice of Mild, Medium, Hot or the painful-sounding \"Suicide\" variety) and desserts which include Cheesecake and Tiramisu.\n\nI had actually eaten Pizza Heaven's dishes several times before actually setting foot in the restaurant thanks to their quick delivery service to my place of business. When I ultimately made it there in the flesh, the first thing I noticed was how clean it was inside. The menu touts that Channel 3 News gave them the distinction of  \"Cleanest Kitchen in the Valley\". I would have to agree that if the kitchen looks anything like the rest of the interior, then they keep things in excellent and sanitary condition. The restaurant has also been awarded New Times \"Best of Phoenix\" award and although I haven't tried too many other local pizza places, I would have to agree that the award was well-deserved.\n\nFor those of you who don't want to pull yourself away from the comfort of your couch and your precious XBox, you can have your food delivered for a minimum of a $15 order.

Dealing with the positives first my French Toast with Bacon & Maple Syrup along with my friend's order turned up in good time after the order was placed, as did our paninis on the first of our 1am visits. Drinks were also not delayed. On the down side, however, our second late night visit saw us having to amend our drinks order twice (first due to there being no St. Helier cider & secondly due to there being no Rose) and the requested Nachos with no Guacamole but extra Sour Cream arrived with the green stuff & not the white as Sour Cream had also run out. They were therefore left untouched (they looked rather unappetising anyway due to the uber-orange cheese used in their preparation). Invisibility at time of the bill being required was also an issue. As an earlier reviewer points out they have a captive audience but this should really spur them to do the niche they occupy justice. 2-and-a-half years after my last visit here I took the decision to pop in last Friday around Midnight for want of anywhere decent that wasn't soon going to be kicking out.

The family run restaurant instantly set us at ease. It was rainy and windy out and this place became our sanctuary from the unforgiving elements.\n \nWe started out with a lovely garlic bread bruchetta.

My only issue was that I had wished I wasn't sharing it because I wanted those two pieces of love into my mouth. \n\nNext I had the breaded chicken which came with a very traditional side of spaghetti with marinara sauce. Now let me say something, normally when I go to Italian restaurants I don't go for pasta dishes unless I know they are homemade pasta and absolutely glorious bits of food. Otherwise in my mind I feel like its a waste of money to order something I can easily enough make at home myself. So after having said that I wasn't thrilled to have received the side of pasta with marinara sauce BUT (yes this is a very big BUT) I LOVED IT. Once I tried it I couldn't stop eating it til it was all gone, and after it had all gone into my belly I wished there were more of it. The sauce was perfection, fresh tasty vegetable love. I was sad until I took a bite of the truly glorious breaded chicken. WOW! That was amazing.  I love deep fried food, but am very fussy cause I don't like it to be stodgy or too greasy. This was golden and juicy and just fried enough to make my mouth water and want to bite into it again and again and again, til it too was all gone. And I wanted more.
