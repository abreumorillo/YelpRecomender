A couple of recommendations:\n\n- Don't eat early in the week \n- I don't recommend wearing any tight clothing (no skinny jeans) - you will not be skinny when you leave\n\n\n I walked in for breakfast one early weekday AM.   The place was packed with locals and regulars.    A very good sign.\n\nMy co-worker recommended I get the mixed grill.   I ordered the large mix grill.   My waitress tried to warn me - it is large (very large).    I ended up eating the left-overs for the next 2 days.\n\nFood - \n\nThe Mixed Grill comprises their homemade sausage, grilled onions, grilled peppers, potatoes, fried eggs.     \n\nPortion -\n\nThis should have been a man vs food episode.   I was not going to attempt to eat all the food.   It was really good.\n\nService - \n\nMy waitress looks as if she had been working there for years.   She was fast, friendly, and offered good advice.\n\nPrice - \n\nThe cost ranges $5 - 10.\n\n\nI will definitely go back after I buy some new stretchy pants.", "businessName": "Gab & Eat"}
