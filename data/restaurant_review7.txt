Long John Silver's|Carnegie|PA
i love ljs, but i  had to write a review regarding this particular location.  the inside is very dated and appears to be poorly cared for.  it smelled like burnt fish when we walked in the door.  it took about 15 mins for the food, so i figured it was gonna be all fresh...negative!  the fish was old and cold and fries were a very soft.  the corn lacked butter.

i didn't care for the onion rings and my boyfriend said the coleslaw tasted spoiled.

the chicken planks and hushpuppies were the only things edible.  

service wasn't too bad - nice people.  too bad a whole bunch of flies started flying around the dining area and prep area, which ruined my appetite.
